<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, on Sunday, 6 June I had the great pleasure of acting as presiding officer at a citizenship ceremony held in our historic Legislative Council chamber. At this Queensland Day citizenship ceremony, I welcomed 92 people from 28 countries as new citizens. Honourable members, I ask your indulgence to seek leave to incorporate the rest of my statement in <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-998515"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000454"></A>
This event followed from the Parliament’s inaugural Citizenship Ceremony held on 16 December last year where I welcomed 90 people as new Australian citizens.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000456"></A>
Honourable Members, there is no clearer expression of an individual’s commitment to, and identification with a country, than to be officially one of its citizens.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000458"></A>
As we celebrate 150 years of continuous parliamentary democracy in Queensland, it is fitting that our nation’s newest citizens are able to have their citizenship conferred here at the seat of democracy in our State. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 On 18 May the member for Beaudesert rose on two matters of privilege. The first matter concerned the member being removed from membership of a parliamentary committee allegedly as a disciplinary measure for the member’s agitating for change within the member’s former party. I have circulated a statement in the chamber to members for incorporation in the parliamentary record explaining my ruling in respect of this matter. Is leave granted to incorporate the statement?</Hansard-Body>

MATTER OF PRIVILEGE--REMOVAL OF MEMBER FROM PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000243"></A>
Background--Member’s complaint</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000244"></A>
According to the Member for Beaudesert, on 25 January 2010 the Member, then a member of the Liberal National Party (LNP), compiled an email outlining the direction needed for the LNP which the Member sent to all 34 LNP members, the LNP president, the state director, the Leader of the Opposition’s chief of staff and the LNP’s media adviser. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000245"></A>
On 27 January 2010 an extract of this email was aired in the media. Various internal party matters followed as did media attention.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000246"></A>
Following a public comment by the Member for Beaudesert in the media on Friday 29 January that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should reconsider his position within the LNP, the member received a letter on Wednesday 3 February from the Leader of the Opposition dated 29 January stating: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000247"></A>
‘I wish to advise you that in view of the events of this week, I have advised the Speaker that I have replaced you as the LNP representative on the Law, Justice and Safety Committee of the Queensland Parliament.’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000248"></A>
According to the member on Thursday 4 February the member wrote to the Leader of the Opposition warning him that, according to the procedures of Standing Orders, neither had the member given a formal resignation to the Speaker nor had the matter been ratified by parliament as a whole, and asking if the Leader of the Opposition could reconsider his course of action until after the recommendations from the alcohol fuelled violence investigations were tabled given the extensive amount of work the committee had completed. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000249"></A>
Material tabled by the member also alleged that numerous MPs had called the member prior to a spill motion and advised they had been intimidated and threatened by an Opposition staff member that if they supported his move against the Deputy Leader they would lose their parliamentary committee or shadow minister positions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000250"></A>
According to the member, the course of action taken by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter has ‘severely compromised the process of parliamentary committee membership appointments and currently undermines the actual appointment and replacement process as a mere political reward more over an appointment of parliamentary duty’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000251"></A>
Background--Leader of the Opposition’s response</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000252"></A>
In response, the Leader of the Opposition drew my attention to s.81 ‘of the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 which relates to the membership of Statutory Committees being comprised of members recognised by the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition. The member’s position on the Law, Justice and Safety Committee was determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 29 of the Standing Orders on 9 February 2010’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Parliamentary Law and Practice relating to relevant issues of privilege and contempt</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000254"></A>
Section 37 of the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 provides: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000255"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Meaning of contempt of the Assembly</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000256"></A>
(1) <Hansard-Italic>
Contempt</Hansard-Italic>
 of the Assembly means a breach or disobedience of the powers, rights or immunities, or a contempt, of the Assembly or its members or committees.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000257"></A>
(2) Conduct, including words, is not contempt of the Assembly unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1000258"></A>
(a) the free exercise by the Assembly or a committee of its authority or functions; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1000259"></A>
(b) the free performance by a member of the member’s duties as a member.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000260"></A>
An important point to note here is that in the context of this matter in order for a contempt to be established there must be an ‘improper interference’ with ‘the free performance by a member of the member’s duties as a member’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000261"></A>
It is long established that it amounts to a contempt to obstruct members in the discharge of their duties or responsibilities. For example, molesting a member coming to or from the House or a committee, or on account of their conduct in the House or a committee and impugning or reflecting by writing on account of their actions in the House or committee have all been regarded as contempts. Similarly, to attempt to intimidate a member in their parliamentary conduct by threats or improper influence have also been held to be contempts. (See Erskine May 23rd Edition 2004 at 143-148.) </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000262"></A>
McGee (3rd edition 651-652) notes that in New Zealand, ‘The House regards as most serious any improper attempt to prevent, dissuade or inhibit anyone (member, officer, witness or petitioner) from participating fully in its proceedings’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000263"></A>
However, all the authorities emphasise that in order to be a contempt the actions must be ‘improper’ and must relate to or involve, in the case of a member, the member’s duties and responsibilities as a member in the House or committee. It does not extend to a member’s political activity. Thus, according to Mareau and Montpetit (1st edition at 476):</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000264"></A>
‘In instances where Members have claimed that they have been obstructed or harassed, not directly in their roles as elected representatives but while being involved in matters of political or constituency-related nature, Speakers have consistently ruled that this does not constitute privilege.’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000265"></A>
Perhaps it is not surprising given the important pre-requisites of actions being both ‘improper’ and strictly related to the member’s duties and responsibilities as a member in the House or a committee, that despite over a century of organised political party activity, there is little precedent regarding the intersection of privilege and contempt and the machinations of political parties, including the discipline of their members. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000266"></A>
The only often reported case is that of Mr Brown, a Member of the House of Commons, who upon his election as a member had entered into a contract with his former employee association in order to receive a stipend, but later complained that the executive of the association sought to influence his views under threat of terminating his contract. (See Harris 4th edition at 713 and O. Hood ‘Parliamentary Privilege: The Case of Mr. W. J. Brown’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The current case</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000269"></A>
Section 81 of the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 provides:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000270"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
81 Membership of statutory committees</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000271"></A>
(1) A statutory committee must consist of 7 members nominated as follows--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000272"></A>
(a) 4 members nominated by the member who is recognised in the Legislative Assembly as the Leader of the House; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000273"></A>
(b) 3 members nominated by the member who is recognised in the Legislative Assembly as the Leader of the Opposition.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000274"></A>
(2) The chairperson of a statutory committee must be the member nominated as chairperson by the member who is recognised in the Legislative Assembly as the Leader of the House. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000275"></A>
The provision is designed to ensure that a formulae of balance between government and non-government membership on committees is maintained. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000276"></A>
The provision gives the power of nomination to the Leader of the House and Leader of the Opposition, it does not confer ‘ownership’ of the committee position to the Leader of the House or Leader of the Opposition, as the Assembly as a whole determines such matters. The Leader of the Opposition has no right to remove or ‘replace’ members on a committee, simply a right to move that members be removed or replaced. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000277"></A>
The majority of this matter and the related matter the subject of a separate ruling simply relates to internal political party machinations, including discipline of a party member who also happens to be a member. But in this instance the actions in disciplining a member for party political reasons has touched upon or involved the member’s duties and responsibilities as a member of a parliamentary committee and thus should be examined by the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000278"></A>
In terms of the Leader of the Opposition, it is true that it was the decision of the House that finally removed the member from the committee; but the material before me suggests, and the committee should consider, whether the removal was effectively punishment or discipline for actions within a party.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000279"></A>
The difficulty is that the member’s removal from a parliamentary committee at the apparent behest of the Leader of the Opposition as a punishment for internal party activity, particularly during the course of a committee inquiry, and despite the member’s request to delay removal until the completion of the matter, may have affected the operation of the committee and certainly affected the member in his role and duties as a member of the committee. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000280"></A>
Whether the Leader of the Opposition’s actions were improper or not I think involves complex questions and issues that deserve full consideration and which should be investigated and considered by the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee in detail given the significance of the issues both now and into the future. Accordingly, I refer the matter to the committee. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000281"></A>
I stress that the hearsay allegation by the Member for Beaudesert in a tabled document that a staff member from the Opposition was threatening other members with removal from parliamentary committees may also enliven privilege, but I am not prepared to entertain a reference to the committee on this point on the basis of hearsay contained in a tabled document.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, the second matter raised by the member for Beaudesert on 18 May 2010 concerned the member’s appearance before the executive committee of the Liberal National Party and the alleged compulsory contribution to a marginal seats fund. I have also circulated a statement in the chamber to members for incorporation in the parliamentary record explaining my ruling in respect of this matter. Is leave granted to incorporate the statement? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998760"></A>

MATTER OF PRIVILEGE--APPEARANCE BEFORE PARTY EXECUTIVE AND RELATED MATTERS</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000337"></A>
According to the Member for Beaudesert, he was called to appear before the Liberal National Party’s (LNP’s) President’s Committee on Thursday, 4 February 2010. Such committee had been established to outline a course of disciplinary action as a result of the member telling the media that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition needed to reconsider his position in order for the LNP to reach greater heights. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000338"></A>
The proceedings of this meeting were contained in a statutory declaration signed by the member and a Justice of the Peace on 8 February 2010 and now tabled in the House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000339"></A>
As I noted in respect of my earlier ruling today, it has been long established that it amounts to a contempt to obstruct members in the discharge of their duties or responsibilities as a Member. However, all the authorities emphasise that in order to be a contempt the actions must be ‘improper’ and must relate or involve, in the case of a member, the member’s duties and responsibilities as a member in the House or committee. It does not extend to a member’s political activity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000340"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5), I wrote to the Member for Toowoomba South who was the only member of the House present at this meeting by way of teleconference. I table the Member for Toowoomba South’s response including the background to the meeting.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000341"></A>
It appears to me that the Member’s appearance before the executive committee, no matter how harrowing that event may have been for the member, relates purely to his former role as a member of a political party. There is no connection apparent to his duties or responsibilities as a member of this House or a parliamentary committee. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000342"></A>
Therefore, I see no grounds upon which to refer this matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee and accordingly I will not be referring the matter to the committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.34 am): As part of my government’s ClimateSmart Action Plan, QFleet has released a <Hansard-Italic>
Green Vehicle Guide</Hansard-Italic>
, which has significantly aided fleet managers to reduce their carbon emissions. The ministerial fleet includes all vehicles managed by the Ministerial Services Branch--cars for ministers, parliamentary secretaries, staff and the opposition. The measures are aimed not only at reducing carbon emissions but also at generating financial savings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000603"></A>
Over the last 12 months, as MSB vehicles have come up for replacement, replacements must have a GVG rating of 5.5 or higher. By end of this month, the entire MSB fleet will have met the GVG target. Fifty-five per cent of the fleet are now hybrid or diesel engine vehicles--saving money and saving the impact on the environment. In a further move to reduce both carbon emissions and costs, the size of the fleet has been reduced, with the current number of vehicles at 76 compared to 83 12 months ago, despite increasing the number of cars to the opposition by one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000624"></A>
The result of these initiatives is an annualised carbon emission reduction as at the end of March this year of 16.9 per cent for the fleet. This is already ahead of the whole-of-government target of 15 per cent that we were aiming to reach by the end of 2010. Going hand in hand with the reduction in vehicle numbers is reduced fuel costs. Average costs are now 17 per cent lower than 12 months ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000637"></A>
I congratulate the Minister for Public Works on the work QFleet has done under his leadership. I well remember sitting around the table with him trying to work through what was an achievable target, and we thought 15 per cent by 2010 would be a very long stretch. Under his guidance and the activity of his agency, in fact we are ahead of that target before the end of this year. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.36 am): I can report to the House that arts enthusiasts last week were given a special preview of the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair program for 2010 at a special function in Brisbane. After the success of the inaugural fair in 2009, the event will once again offer a unique marketplace of Indigenous art centres and commercial galleries selling and exhibiting side by side. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000564"></A>
This year over 200 Queensland Indigenous artists will be represented. While this event is held in Cairns, some of these artists are from all over the state. This is a 25 per cent increase on the number of artists represented last year. Last year’s event was a sensational inaugural event. Those who were fortunate enough to be there will, with me, testify to what a great opportunity it provided to showcase the best of Indigenous culture.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000686"></A>
We should be shouting the success of this event from the rooftops and telling the world about this unique Queensland festival. That is why I have authorised an exciting public art project to be created to advertise CIAF to Queenslanders over coming years. Two of the state’s signature tilt trains will be covered with colourful images of artworks by Queensland Indigenous artists. I think everybody recognises the Qantas painted aircraft; Queensland will now be world renowned for trains that are works of art. The first tilt train as a work of art will be on the tracks by October this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000570"></A>
Artists Judy Watson, Arone Meeks, Sally Gabori and Alick Tipoti are shortlisted for the work, and the two final artists will be selected in July. Their artwork will cover two locomotives and seven carriages and, at 185 metres long, we believe that it will be the largest Indigenous work of art ever in Australia. I understand that the artwork the two artists produce for the project will be reproduced digitally and then fitted over the train like a second skin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000573"></A>
The second train art project will be open to expressions of interest to emerging Queensland Indigenous artists--and those expressions of interest open this Saturday. We expect the second train to be on the tracks between Brisbane and Cairns early next year. I expect that these trains will make quite a sight as they go roaring through the towns, canefields, farms and communities right up the coast of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1000796"></A>
The 2010 program will have a stronger focus on public programming. There will be more artists’ talks, children’s art activities and a public art trail. Further previews will be held shortly in Townsville and in Melbourne before the final program is unveiled as part of the official Cairns Festival launch in July.</Hansard-Body>

Here in Brisbane this week over 50,000 children under eight and their families took over the Cultural Centre for the 10th Out of the Box Festival. The Queensland Performing Arts Centre has been reinvented as a giant playground for this magnificent festival. For seven days, the Cultural Centre will be overflowing with performances, workshops and exhibitions. Free activities for Queensland children and their families will feature as this home-grown and world-renowned festival celebrates a decade of achievement. It is not only children who are consuming the arts in droves here in Queensland; we have seen more than 56,000 visitors at the Ron Mueck exhibition at GoMA, and every day more than 2,500 people are giving millinery a try at <Hansard-Italic>

This year also sees the Queensland Ballet reach a significant milestone. This year is the golden anniversary of the Queensland Ballet. After 50 years of operation, the company now presents around 100 performances each and every year across Queensland. The Queensland Ballet’s repertoire ranges from popular classics to contemporary new works by emerging and established choreographers. I am sure people from both sides of the House will have had an opportunity to see the great work of the Queensland Ballet. They are one of the companies that makes an effort to take their work into regional Queensland and ensure that people, wherever they live, get a chance to see them. I know that everyone will join me in wishing the Queensland Ballet a very happy 50th birthday. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): Next week at Suncorp Stadium--one of the best rugby league venues in the world--the Queensland State of Origin team will be looking to make history. A victory would seal an unprecedented fifth straight series win for the mighty Maroons. Of course, the boys are in this position after a dominant performance in game 1 in Sydney last month. The Maroons were by far the better team, and I think the final score of 28-24 flattered the Blues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002461"></A>
However, we know that next week New South Wales will be desperate to level the series and restore some pride. I will be cheering on the mighty Maroons, and I am sure my New South Wales counterpart, Kristina Keneally, will be watching with great interest. Kristina Keneally and I have a friendly bet going. A Queensland win will see a specially designed maroon flag fly from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. If the unthinkable happens--and New South Wales wins the next two games--then a blue flag will hang from the Story Bridge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002462"></A>
As this is the first origin bet between two women premiers, Kristina has accepted my suggestion of an extra twist. The Premier of the losing state will host a footy breakfast fundraiser to benefit breast cancer, with the proceeds to be equally split between breast cancer charities in each state. I have no doubt that Darren Lockyer and the rest of the team will do us proud next week, and I know that Queenslanders will be right behind them next Wednesday. I wish them all the best. I say to Kristina: the maroon flag is being prepared for a trip to Sydney and a date with the Harbour Bridge. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.42 am): The Bligh government’s strong economic plan is paying a dividend in health and medical research. The Bligh government has chosen to stick with our plan that includes an investment in the health and future jobs of Queenslanders through building our world-class medical research capacity. We have a collection of world-renowned independent and university research institutes that every year attract millions of dollars in research funding and grants. We also have some of the best and the brightest researchers and scientists.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002466"></A>
I am pleased to advise the House today that Queensland Health has recently awarded 14 research fellowships to help further secure our future on the medical research stage. The Bligh government is investing $1.375 million per year in these fellowships, each of which will be run as five-year projects across a range of fields including oral health, mental health, cancer care, falls prevention, respiratory and infectious diseases. An additional 260 hours each week will be spent on research within Queensland Health as a result of awarding these 14 new fellowships.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002467"></A>
Each of the projects is unique, including undertaking trials in kidney disease, undertaking research into cystic fibrosis and other respiratory conditions in children and investigating the role of the environment in both causing and preventing falls. Some are looking at ways to improve the outcome of treatment in patients suffering from liver disease, improving the care of patients suffering from infectious disease and evaluating different interventions for children with a restricted dietary intake.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002468"></A>
In this year’s budget, the Bligh government’s strong economic plan will give our major research centres a massive funding injection. Queensland jobs will benefit from a $61.5 million investment in this year’s budget to two medical research centres being built on our hospital campuses. The Queensland Children’s Hospital Academic and Research Centre and the jointly funded Translational Research Institute at the Princess Alexandra Hospital will conduct world-class medical research within the campus of two of Queensland’s iconic hospitals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002469"></A>
Last year, the Queensland government committed $80 million to establish and build a child health research facility within the Queensland Children’s Hospital. A new Queensland Children’s academic and research institute will be located within the QCH precinct. It will bring together paediatric research staff from the Royal Children’s Hospital and Mater Children’s Hospital and other institutions. It will accommodate almost double the current number of Queensland paediatric researchers at RCH and Mater.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002470"></A>
The Queensland Children’s Hospital’s research will consolidate Queensland’s research efforts in areas where we are already world leaders, like paediatric respiratory health, Indigenous paediatric health, paediatric infectious and viral diseases, paediatric burns, and paediatric and juvenile mental health. By combining the research expertise and resources of the RCH and the Mater Children’s Hospital, we will deliver a world-class research facility bringing all of Queensland’s paediatric research leaders onto one campus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002471"></A>
The Translational Research Institute is another example of the Bligh government’s commitment to delivering world-class healthcare outcomes for Queensland. The future TRI six-storey building means job space for 650 researchers with plenty of room to work--around 36,000 metres of gross floor space. Adding weight to the scale and quality of work at TRI, Australian of the Year and inventor of Gardasil, Professor Ian Frazer, will be among a host of scientists and researchers to call the new facility home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002472"></A>
The Bligh government’s budget provides $31.2 million over four years to support the QIMR, which conducts research into more than 40 of the world’s most debilitating illnesses through programs researching genetics and population health, immunology, cancer and cell biology, infectious diseases, vaccine development, mental health and Indigenous health. By sticking to our strong economic plan, the Bligh government is investing in the jobs and future health of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.45 am): The budget I handed down on Tuesday demonstrated that the Bligh Labor government’s economic strategy was delivering more jobs, higher growth, lower deficits and lower debt. It was a commitment to jobs above all else that drove our economic strategy last year, and that same determination flows through into the 2010-11 state budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002476"></A>
I can report to the House that the latest employment data, released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, again shows that our commitment to jobs is paying off. Queensland is again the job-generating capital of Australia, creating 8,800 new jobs last month. That is almost half of the 18,400 jobs created nationally. Importantly, of the 8,800 jobs created last month 8,200 were full-time jobs. That is 10 consecutive months of jobs generation in Queensland. A grand total of 63,500 new jobs have been created since July, of which 37,700 are full-time jobs. Our trend unemployment rate is steady at 5.5 per cent--a clear indication that, despite fuelling half of the jobs growth nationally, we continue to face the challenges of a booming population. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002477"></A>
At the 2009 election, in the midst of the global recession that sent the US into double-digit unemployment and countries like Spain closing in on 20 per cent unemployment, the Premier declared our commitment to create a net new 100,000 jobs over the term of this parliament. While it was a tough start, the data released yesterday shows that we are well on our way. Since March 2009 there have been 49,300 net new jobs created in Queensland. That brings our target down to 50,700, with 22 months to go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002478"></A>
We have put in place a strategy and the jobs are being delivered. We have a $17.1 billion building program--still the highest in the nation. We have an extension of our tax rebates for employers of apprentices and trainees. We have concessions for first home buyers, including the introduction of a regional boost to the first home owner grant. We also have funding for programs like the Green Army, which is helping disadvantaged Queenslanders get into the workforce. We remain 100 per cent committed to Labor’s policy to create more jobs sooner. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh government has a plan to meet the challenge of population growth in South-East Queensland. Part of that plan is to support smarter development of renewed communities and continue to protect our tin and timber suburbs. Milton is already a mixed-use centre that allows people to work and play closer to home. This development will add to that mix and reduce reliance on private vehicles. For over five years, Milton has been identified as a preferred site for such development. This proposed development is located on one of the most important parcels of land in Milton, adjacent to the railway station and public transport corridors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002484"></A>
Submissions to me by the community, including from the member for Mount Coot-tha, have emphasised the need for public open space and consideration of the project’s scale. In response to these concerns about the scale, I have considered the application against the advanced draft local plan and reduced the maximum height of the building to 30 storeys in line with that plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002485"></A>
Extra open space and visual amenity conditions I have approved include: $52,500 in public art contributions--this is the equivalent rate for CBD developments and will see local public art on permanent display; a $6 million contribution to improve public access to Milton station for all those who use it; and requesting the developer to finalise with council further open space contributions, specifically to enhance local parks within Milton. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002486"></A>
I recognise that this decision may cause concern amongst those in the community who have objected to the development, but development like this in some places relieves growth pressure in South-East Queensland and helps us protect the character of tin and timber suburbs for generations to come. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (9.50 am): All Australians have an interest in ensuring that individuals engaged in the despicable practice of people smuggling are caught, prosecuted and punished according to the law. This is an activity that prays upon the vulnerable, the desperate and the weak. It exploits those in dire need. We must condemn it and we must take action to stamp it out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002534"></A>
Border protection and people smuggling are national issues and we must all play a part. It has been widely reported publicly that individuals have been brought to Queensland who are facing charges of people smuggling. These individuals are now being held securely in jail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002535"></A>
The federal Labor government has tough laws against people smuggling, with repeat offenders facing up to 20 years behind bars. This is not the first time federal offences have been dealt with in Queensland and nor will it be the last. It is not the first time people smugglers have been prosecuted through the Queensland courts, including during the Howard government years. Under the law, Canberra chooses where these cases are prosecuted. This is not a matter for the state. It is a matter for the Commonwealth and remains a Commonwealth responsibility.  </Hansard-Body>

 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (9.51 am): In February 2007 the then Attorney-General and minister for justice requested the Crime and Misconduct Commission undertake an examination of policing in Indigenous communities in Queensland. This was in response to increasing tension in relations between the Queensland Police Service and Indigenous communities following the death of Cameron Doomadgee on Palm Island and riots in Aurukun. </Hansard-Body>

The CMC’s report--<Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1002546"></A>
Government agencies including the Queensland Police Service, Queensland Corrective Services, the Department of Justice and Attorney-General, the Department of Communities, Queensland Health and the Department of Education and Training have already undertaken considerable work towards the reforms recommended by the CMC and this work is detailed in our response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002547"></A>
There is no doubt that crime prevention and policing in remote Indigenous communities has its challenges, just like every community in the state has its own unique issues. The Queensland Police Service currently polices Indigenous communities using a combination of state police, police liaison officers and a small number of Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander police. Local councils also employ their own community police. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002548"></A>
The CMC recommended the Queensland Police Service create a new structure, an Indigenous partnership policing command, to be led by an assistant commissioner, to support improvements in policing in Indigenous communities. However, it is the government’s view that a new and separate command risks isolating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander crime prevention and policing from mainstream service delivery. For this reason, the Queensland Police Service will create a number of new positions, particularly in the Far North and northern police regions, which will focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. An assistant police commissioner will also be appointed as a champion or sponsor for Indigenous policing issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002549"></A>
As highlighted in the CMC’s report, action by the government and police can only achieve so much. There needs to be ongoing partnership with communities to achieve reduced crime and violence in Indigenous communities. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (9.54 am): Last week I travelled to Roma for a firsthand look at Queensland’s emerging coal seam gas industry and to better understand the potential environmental impacts that need to be avoided and minimised. During my visit the management of water from CSG rang loud and clear as an issue in the community. People are rightly concerned about how this water will be safely stored and handled without impacting on the surrounding environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002553"></A>
The state government has already moved to safeguard the environment from this risk. Legislation passed last month prevents the construction of new evaporation dams for the disposal of CSG water in production fields. It followed a range of other restrictions and requirements mines and energy minister, Stephen Robertson, had announced for the CSG industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002554"></A>
Today, the state government further tightens the restrictions on CSG water. I table a new policy on water management for the industry to ensure salt produced through the CSG process does not impact on the environment. </Hansard-Body>

 Department of Environment and Resource Management, Coal Seam Gas Water Management Policy, June 2010. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002556"></A>
I confirm this policy will apply to the regulation of all LNG proponents. Through this new policy we want to see CSG use this water first and foremost for the benefit of the wider community. Preferred users of treated coal seam gas water under the policy will include aquaculture, coal washing and other industrial uses, irrigation and livestock watering and dust suppression. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002557"></A>
The policy includes a hierarchy of acceptable solutions for the management, treatment and disposal of brine and solid salt residue resulting from the treatment of the coal seam gas water. The highest and most desirable level in the hierarchy would see brine and solid salt residues chemically processed or treated to create usable products such as soda ash that can be used in other industrial processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002558"></A>
The least desirable outcome and the lowest level in hierarchy is for the brine or solid salt residues to be disposed of to an existing all-purpose built regulated waste disposal facility. Where the highest and most desirable level in the hierarchy is not chosen, the operator of a CSG project will need to demonstrate that this option is not feasible for sound environmental, technical or economic reasons. Disposal of untreated coal seam gas water by discharging into surface waters or onto land is not supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002559"></A>

 I know you are not interested in animal welfare, but other people are. Most Queenslanders are in fact interested in this. I would like to place on the record the sterling work done by the Leader of the House in suggesting this site be chosen for this very noble outcome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002566"></A>
Construction at the site has now begun in earnest. When completed by mid next year it will be a veritable Noah’s Ark holding over 700 animals, both domestic and wild. It will be the best of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. The campus will be more than double the size of the current overcrowded RSPCA facilities at Fairfield. Very importantly, an estimated 134 jobs are expected to be created during construction.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I know you do not want to hear this. As a mark of this community’s respect for the RSPCA, and the lack of it from those opposite, the Bligh government has contributed $19 million to the new animal care campus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004208"></A>
The funding comprises $7 million for the value of the site and $12 million towards construction. Early site works have already taken place at Wacol--existing buildings have been stripped for refurbishment, most of the fencing has been removed and surplus demountable buildings have been relocated. Major earthworks began last week after development approval was finally obtained from the Brisbane City Council. It took 14 months. The new animal care campus will have stables, an adoption pen for cats and dogs, a modern farmyard, horse paddocks and a wildlife veterinary clinic. It also will have education facilities to educate the public about the care of animals. I congratulate the RSPCA’s Queensland CEO, Mark Townend, for his great leadership in getting this project to this stage. The RSPCA cares for over 40,000 animals across Queensland each year, with the new facility at Wacol caring for about half that number when finished. Anyone who loves animals will be pleased--and we know those opposite do not. They love one another I suppose; that is something. No, they do not really do that either. Anyone who loves animals will be pleased to see this new modern facility being built for them. Many animals give unquestioned loyalty and love to their owners--something that is missing in those opposite. I am pleased to say we are doing something for them in return. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.02 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. Part 4 of the Police Service Administration Act requires the agreement of the chairperson of the CMC before the Police Commissioner can be appointed and their contract finalised. Premier, did the government comply with the act and obtain the express agreement of the chairperson of the CMC before the government announced the reappointment of the Police Commissioner on 25 February?</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am very pleased to advise both him and the whole House that of course the government complied with the requirements of the legislation. The Minister for Police sought through a direct conversation with the chair his views on the proposed appointment and secured his agreement before putting it forward and making any decision or announcement on it.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Treasurer. Whilst telling every other department to cut costs and whilst telling Queenslanders that new taxes are necessary to fund debts, how does the Treasurer explain that his own department, the Treasury department, blew its budget this financial year by 46 per cent? If the Treasurer’s own department cannot come in on budget, is it little wonder that every single Queenslander is carrying $18,000 in Labor debt each?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004244"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and make a couple of substantive remarks which anyone would be able to realise from reading through the budget papers. In the first instance, the Treasury department obviously is the central repository of government and therefore many flows through the government are recorded through the Treasury accounts. On that front, matters like extra federal funding, including through the stimulus package for the first home owner boost and others, flow through the Treasury. The second point to make is that there is an increase in effort in the Treasury. Obviously we are undertaking a very significant program of commercial transactions, and that much is also detailed in the budget papers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004250"></A>
But how extraordinary is it for the Leader of the Opposition to come in here after delivering yesterday’s woeful excuse for an economic plan and accuse anybody of not being able to run an economic policy? What we saw yesterday from this opposition leader was a budget reply that did not mention a dollar figure, was a budget reply that did not include a single policy document, was a budget reply that did not include one single costing, was a budget reply that did not include one skerrick of detailed information or policy. It was long promised, and great anticipation was put forward by the Leader of the Opposition for yesterday, and did we see the policy eruption yesterday? Did we see the great volcano erupt full of policy detail? No! What we saw was Puff the Magic Dragon. All it turned out to be was a bit of smoke and a bit of puffery and ultimately a cruel hoax--a cruel hoax on those people whom he is pretending to offer some policy relief for, because did he say what it will cost? Did he say what the policy would cost?</Hansard-Body>

 Did he say for one minute what that policy would cost? Did he say what his electricity rebate would cost? Let us give him the chance. What is the answer? What is the cost of that policy? Silence! Let us ask the shadow Treasurer, who is up the back doing the numbers. What is the cost of the policy? No! What is the cost of the motor vehicle registration policy? Hundreds of millions of dollars, but will they tell you? No! What are we going to do in this budget? Every single last cent from motor vehicle registration will go into the roads building program. And what are those opposite committed to doing? Stopping the road building program! Will they tell us what it costs? Do they know what it costs? Do they have a clue? As of yesterday--one year on--all we see from the Leader of the Opposition is the same old platitudes and puffery--not a clue, not a policy costing, not any detail. It was the most embarrassing policy effort that this parliament has seen in a generation. No wonder he ran away and would not answer the questions and sent the poor old shadow Treasurer out to face the music. It was a disgrace.</Hansard-Body>

 Order! Stop the clock. There is too much audible conversation again from both sides of the House. I am wanting to hear the answer from the Premier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004267"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The evidence of the success of our economic strategy and our jobs plan could not be more evidenced than by those figures that were released yesterday. The ABS data showed Queensland once again is the jobs-generating capital of Australia. We have now seen jobs creation for 10 consecutive months in Queensland. We went to the election with a very clear target: 100,000 new jobs, and we are now almost halfway there with 50,700 to go. So less than halfway through the term of government and we are almost halfway on our target. Since July last year we have created more than 63,000 jobs. Almost half of all of the jobs created in Australia in the last month were created where? Queensland. Some 18,400 jobs were created in Australia, and 8,800 of them were created here in Queensland. Why is that happening? It is not happening by accident. It is happening because we have a strategy that says put the foot on the accelerator and keep the economy moving and build projects in economies across the state where they need stimulus most. So what we are seeing is roads being built, hospitals being built, schools being built, public transport initiatives in every part of Queensland, and every one of those projects is creating and maintaining jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004271"></A>
Of course, what have we heard about jobs from those opposite? I did not hear a jobs plan yesterday. I think yesterday’s effort by the Leader of the Opposition was most instructive in its silences. What was it silent on? It was silent on the infrastructure plan. Will the opposition keep building it? Silence. There was silence on disability funding, silence on the new kindies, silence on projects across Queensland, silence on waste energy. There was not one commitment to the projects that are on track, the projects that are in the pipeline. There was not one commitment to SEQIPP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004273"></A>
I think we know what is going on over there. We are going to see a capital works freeze exactly like we saw the last time. We are creating the jobs; those opposite cut them. We create jobs; they cut them. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health, Payroll System</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005954"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. Given that it is 80 days since Labor stopped paying Queensland Health workers, is it true that earlier this week Mr Terry Mehan, the Deputy Director-General, Performance and Accountability at Queensland Health, attended a meeting of Health payroll staff in Nambour and contradicted the minister’s claim that Labor’s payroll disaster could go on for another 365 days? Is it true that, when asked how long the payroll disaster would go on, Mr Mehan said, ‘It will take at least 18 months and maybe even two years plus’? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005958"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Yesterday I made it clear to the House--and I have said it on a number of occasions--that our immediate priority in relation to the payroll is to stabilise the payroll and to make sure that as far as possible by the end of this financial year we can have our pays accurate for the close of the financial year. We would hope that there are as few as possible further adjustments that need to be made in relation to the end of this financial year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005959"></A>
In relation to the Lattice backlog, which is the previous system, the reductions in that have been going extremely well. I indicated to the House that, in addition to the issue of the stabilisation of the payroll and indeed paying people appropriately and making sure that that is undertaken, the medium and longer-term views are in relation to how we could have the system functioning better. One of the things that I think is very clear from this--and I have said it before--is that I think for a lengthy period Queensland Health did not have the payroll system operating appropriately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005960"></A>
We certainly know from the Lattice system--and I recall there was an article in the newspaper last year where there were questions of overpayments in relation to that--we need to do fundamental re-engineering of how we pay people. That is something that is independent of the IT that is involved in the system. That is about how we go about doing things with our workers. That is the important ground-up stuff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005961"></A>
One of the reasons that we have, for example, an integrated ticketing system that works in South-East Queensland compared to Sydney and Melbourne is that that fundamental front-end engineering in terms of how things are done was done first. I think that is one of the criticisms that I have in particular in relation to the Health payroll issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005963"></A>
Of course, the SAP/Workbrain system was designed to progressively roll out further features, for example, ultimately, I understand, to allow workers to apply for leave and other things online. Those functionalities under all systems are operated as they are rolled out. What I have made crystal clear is that my expectation is that there are medium and long-term things that will have to happen to have a system that is not only a system that is stable and pays people appropriately--</Hansard-Body>

Mrs MILLER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Could the Premier update the House on what projects the Bligh government is fast-tracking for growth communities in my electorate such as Springfield? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005973"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. On Monday, I was very pleased to join the member, the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport to announce that we will be accelerating the construction of the Springfield railway line by two years. This is an investment of more than $600 million that will see 10 kilometres of rail line into one of the fastest growing master planned communities in Australia. This is part of our commitment to developing liveable communities in the western corridor as part of managing population growth in the South-East Queensland area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005974"></A>
Bringing forward this extension of rail line gives 18,000 residents access to world-class public transport sooner. Stage 1 of the project from Darra to Richlands began in 2008 and is expected to be completed next year. We will see a state-of-the-art station, a dedicated new bikeway, which is all giving people options about transport. The entire Springfield rail line will be open by 2013, two years ahead of the current schedule. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005975"></A>
This is not only good planning; it is good value for money. Being able to bring this project forward means that we can keep on the alliance workforce that will be part of a tender in the second half of this year so that, instead of disbanding the workforce and then ramping it up again in two years time at considerable cost, we will not only get a much better value outcome for the taxpayers but also keep all of those people in jobs. That is what this government is about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005976"></A>
As I said, if those opposite were in power, I think we saw yesterday the first indications that they would not be building Queensland, that they will join their federal counterpart Tony Abbott, whose own budget reply was at least honest in saying that he would slash $1.4 billion out of the national infrastructure fund. What we saw yesterday was nothing short of a stunning contribution to the discipline of economic policy. What we saw from the Leader of the Opposition was an outline of how he would pay down debt by spending more. He is going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars that is unfunded. So he will have to borrow. He is going to reduce debt by borrowing. It is a financial miracle! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005977"></A>
We were all waiting to hear more about it, but we were disappointed because of course he would not show up at a press conference. He would not go and talk about it or answer questions. He went scurrying out of here--like he does most days--got in the foetal position under his desk, started sucking his thumb and calling for his mother. In the great tradition of the member for Moggill and the member for Southern Downs, the LNP has another leader they cannot put in front of a television camera. This leader is absolutely weak.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005980"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Emergency Services. In late 2009 Marianne Rankin was forced to drive herself to hospital after the 000 call centre failed repeatedly in efforts to direct an ambulance to her rural address. If the Queensland Ambulance Service cannot find a simple address on a major highway, what hope is there for Queenslanders who live off the beaten track? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005983"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Queenslanders cannot believe a single word this member says when it comes to ambulance issues. On so many occasions this member has presented in this parliament half-truths, half the facts when it comes to circumstances. So following question time I will look into the details of that particular case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005984"></A>
There is no doubt that there have been instances where the Ambulance Service has not performed up to expectations in terms of some of these issues. The Queensland Ambulance Service acknowledges that in all of those cases. Where a mistake has been made, where the performance has not been up to the level which I expect, the commissioner expects and the government expects, those matters are fully investigated and thoroughly dealt with. I will check the facts of that particular circumstance because this member, as I have indicated, has a history of twisting the truth and deliberately undermining public confidence in the Ambulance Service. In terms of that question, I will look at those particular facts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005985"></A>
I might just touch on a couple of other issues that the member has been referring to in the community in relation to the Queensland Ambulance Service. Following the budget he has again been undermining what I believe is a significant budget allocation and significant resourcing allocation for the Queensland Ambulance Service. The member makes claims about the number of ambulance officers that we have in the field. He suggests that the number is going backwards in terms of the resources that we have supplied. Let us look at a comparison between the Queensland Ambulance Service ambulance officer to population ratio compared to other states. Queensland currently has an ambulance officer to population ratio of around 55.9 officers per 100,000. We have been resourcing the Ambulance Service, with an increase of 630 officers over the last four years. How does that 55.9 compare to other states? The Australian average is 43.2. The New South Wales ratio 42.1 and in Victoria it is 43.4. This member claimed that the Queensland Ambulance Service was going backwards in terms of resourcing. We lead the nation in terms of the number of ambulance officers we have in the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005986"></A>
The member has raised an issue in terms of ambulance performance. There are those rare cases where the Ambulance Service gets it wrong. We deal with 750,000 incidents a year. Not every incident will be responded to appropriately, but I have absolute confidence in the ability of this service to provide the first-class service that it does throughout Queensland. Let us look at response times. We lead the nation with a 50 per cent response time: 8.4 minutes compared to 10.3 in New South Wales. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question.

But that is nothing new when it comes to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007559"></A>
The Bligh government has embarked upon a $122 million upgrade of the Ipswich Hospital that will deliver 84 additional beds and increase capacity in key areas including emergency care, surgery, maternity, critical care and medical imaging. There is $6.1 million in this year’s budget, and we are also investing $6.7 million to expand the emergency department for paediatrics. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007560"></A>
This is a major upgrade in Ipswich in local health services that will also create more than 730 jobs over the life of the project for the whole community. I note in the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland Times</Hansard-Italic>
 this morning the criticism by the LNP and the shadow minister and the industrial wing of the LNP, Dr Mason Stevenson from the AMAQ, the one who does not believe women should be doctors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007561"></A>
Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition announced a number of initiatives, including a three-year freeze on road spending under the LNP. But what did he announce on health? Nothing. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition not only announced no health policies, he then announced a number of un-funded policies that, far from returning the state to a AAA credit rating, took it further away. Barry O’Farrell in New South Wales managed to have some leadership and do something but time and time again, and for the fifth time in a major situation, the Leader of the Opposition squibbed it. He is not capable of announcing a policy and facing the media in relation to policy discussion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007562"></A>
What is worse is for the opposition to say in the <Hansard-Italic>
Ipswich Times</Hansard-Italic>
 that a second hospital was needed and the same day make no commitment to additional health funding and, in particular, to Ipswich. I know about the western corridor, because it is an article of faith that this government supports it. I can remember it was not until Jim Soorley was elected that Inala and Wynnum got Brisbane City Council buses. It was not until Labor was around that fair dinkum investment happened in the western corridor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007563"></A>
Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition announced no funding for health. He announced that no way could he could raise revenue for the other funding that he announced. He has again shown that he is a failure in this regard. He will not announce any money for health, not even on the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, because the cupboard is bare and, in fact, he is selling off the shelves.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I appreciate his interest in the national curriculum. Australia is moving ahead of most other nations in the world because across all the states we are developing, with the leadership of the Rudd government, a national curriculum across all school sectors for all school students. We are coming into the modern age and stepping well and truly into the 21st century. We are doing that with the combined effort of all of the education ministers who met yesterday in Perth to discuss further how we can progress the national curriculum. We are all committed to ensuring that we get the best education possible for our students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007569"></A>
We talked about how important it is to establish the new English, mathematics, history and science curriculum to commence by 2013. The national curriculum authority, ACARA, will report further to us in a couple of months time. There has been an extensive consultation period. ACARA is going through all of the feedback from across the country. It will develop the final curriculum which will be available later in the year. We will then progressively implement that curriculum across all three sectors here in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007570"></A>
While we are talking about the national curriculum and education, it has been claimed by the shadow spokesman for the LNP that there is no information available on the year 2 diagnostic test provided and that we are hiding information about the diagnostic test in Queensland. I will give the honourable member a little bit of help: it might be in this document, it might be in this document, or it might be in this document. That is three documents out of the seven budget documents. I will help the honourable member by saying it is in one of three out of seven documents. I will give him another hint: the front cover is yellow. The other thing I can let members know is that so much hard work has he done, and wasted taxpayer funds, that yesterday he put a question on notice asking me to help him read this document and tell him the answer. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for her question and her commitment to jobs. She is a member of a government that is leading jobs generation in this state. For the second month in a row the Queensland government and the Queensland economy have produced more jobs than any other state. It stands in contradistinction to what we have see from the other side this week. They promised us all the policies in the world, and what did they deliver? No costings, no policies. They have been more interested in ads all week than in policies. So I produced an ad for the Leader of the Opposition, and I will table it. </Hansard-Body>

The reason he has not produced policies is that he would be caught out telling the truth, because they support privatisation. He has said that he is going to reduce the deficit by spending more--the magic pudding approach. How is he going to do this? He is going to grow the economy! It is a cheerleader recovery; he is going to cheer it on from the sidelines as if the pure aura he sees around his head when he stares lovingly in the mirror is going to move the Queensland economy back into growth and create the prosperity across the land in his own aura. His policy incapacity has only been matched by his vain arrogance and his lack of capacity to put forward any policy. It has been a week for him to hang his head in shame. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (10.31 am): Queensland is entering a new era in health services: firstly, in the needs of the community; secondly, in the method of delivery and; thirdly, in potentially new funding models. What has astounded the LNP and me is that this government has rolled over and signed up to the national health and hospitals network without even a whimper, without even raising the hard questions that it should have put to Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard in relation to what it was going to be giving away. This government gave away one-third of the GST, which turned out to be 42 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009260"></A>
One of the issues with this document is that details do not exist. There are no details, in this document or since, that outline exactly how this is going to happen. I make the point that planning cannot occur in a vacuum. Unless detail is provided in the very near future, that is what we risk in this state: more health planning in a vacuum. Queensland cannot afford a repeat of the March 2010 quarterly hospitals report. It is significant that we go back to that report and consider it and consider what occurred 12 months ago to see how far we have progressed with the Health budget in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009261"></A>
In March 2009 there were 3,361 category 1 and category 2 patients waiting longer than recommended. Twelve months later there were 4,746--an increase of 1,485. The waiting list for the waiting list had grown from 180,582 to 199,457 and the dental waiting list had blown out from 102,000 to 105,000. Access block was up to 34 per cent; ambulance ramping was up 10 per cent. This is the sort of document we are going to be seeing time and time again in this House because this government is planning in a vacuum and the federal government has provided no details in relation to what this government hangs its cap on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009262"></A>
For 2010-11 the government has handed down a Health budget of close to $10 billion, but today it is our opportunity to assess how the government has scored in regard to 2009-10. There are a number of areas that I will canvass. The first is the capital spend. The estimated actual capital spend for 2009-10 has come in at $934 million. That is $365 million, or 28 per cent, less than budgeted. This means that, of the $775 million projected increase in the capital budget in 2010-11, 47 per cent of that capital is money that should have been spent in 2009-10 and was not. It raises a question of how we can believe the health minister when he says that he will spend $1.7 billion in 2010-11 on health infrastructure when the government spent 28 per cent less than it said it was going to spend this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009263"></A>
This government has form when it comes to underdelivering on capital spend. In the 2008-09 year it underspent to the sum of $431 million. In fact, this is a habit of this government, but there were serious consequences. At a time when Queenslanders are crying out for more health services, more beds and better EDs, why has the health minister allowed a slow-down in the rollout of important health services? It is tragic to say that the budget papers reveal that only 113 additional beds were delivered this financial year, despite more than 100,000 extra people calling Queensland home in the same period. As a direct consequence of the government not getting the planning right, we are now seeing available beds in this state per 1,000 residents fall from 2.34 in 2008-09 to 2.31 in 2009-10. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009264"></A>
It is totally unacceptable that important hospital projects are being delayed and bed ratios are falling while the budget papers show that access block on average is an appalling 34 per cent. The Bligh Labor government’s target is 20 per cent for access block in this state. The issue of bed numbers is crucial, and the delay in building hospitals delays the delivery of beds. This impacts directly on the delivery of services on time and efficiently. A document titled <Hansard-Italic>
Access block and overcrowding: a literature review</Hansard-Italic>
, prepared by the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, says at page 1--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009265"></A>
It has been estimated, by different authors and methods, that there is a 20%-30% excess mortality rate every year that is attributable to access block and ED overcrowding in Australia. This equates to approximately 1,500 deaths (at 2003 levels of access block) per year, which is similar to the road toll. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1009266"></A>
This states that 1,500 deaths occur because of access block in our hospitals across this nation. At page 2 it makes this comment--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009267"></A>
In summary, there are not enough available beds to meet demand. This results in access block and ED overcrowding. This is associated with significant mortality and human suffering. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009268"></A>
There is a human price; there is a life price to pay for not building infrastructure on time and not delivering the beds we need in this state, and this government has a history of failing in regard to both matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009269"></A>
A number of critical hospital projects have been delayed, and they include the Mackay Base Hospital, where less than half of the budgeted funds of $61 million was spent; the Rockhampton Hospital expansion, where less than a quarter of the $74 million was spent; and only $6.6 million of the budgeted $140 million was spent on the Faster Emergency Care in Our Hospitals project. The Faster Emergency Care in Our Hospitals project, identified by the ACEM as being a critical component in delivering health services, was massively underspent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009270"></A>
Other underspends include the Bundaberg Hospital expansion, the Ipswich Hospital additional beds, the PA Hospital ED, the Queensland Children’s Hospital budget and also the Queensland Children’s Hospital academic and research centres. There were numerous projects that were also not completed in the financial year and they should have been. It was stated by this government that they would be. They include the additional bed capacity of the Cairns Hospital emergency department--again, the ED features prominently in this arena--the Robina Hospital ED and intensive care unit project, the Toowoomba Hospital birthing centre, the Townsville Hospital neonatal intensive care unit, the Cape York improved primary healthcare centre and others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011091"></A>
Those projects are critical to the continued delivery of services and their delay is hurting Queenslanders. Across the whole Health portfolio, 13 capital projects due for completion in 2009-10 were not completed. Of the 58 ongoing capital projects, 51 are stated to have had less spent in the 2009-10 year than was promised. The danger here is quite obvious: if you do not provide the hospitals, the healthcare centres and other structures needed to provide care, care will not be delivered to people on time. As I said earlier, there are serious consequences for not doing so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011094"></A>
The mental health social marketing campaign of $8.5 million over four years to raise awareness of mental health is very welcome, but it needs to be backed up with quality mental health services and infrastructure. However, the budget papers reveal the shrinking capacity of the department to deliver community mental health service contacts. I want to read some statistics that appear in the budget papers and then refer to one particular note that appears at 3-132. The number of community mental health service contacts has fallen for the second consecutive year. On the papers, there were 466,251 less service contracts delivered in 2009-10 than forecast by the department and more than 100,000 less service contacts delivered in the 2008-09 year. This translates to 6,300 fewer people being provided with community and mental health services in 2009-10 than in 2008-09, despite the prevalence of mental health illness continuing to rise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011096"></A>
In light of those comments, I refer to footnote 63 on page 3-132 in relation to those figures. It reads as follows--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011098"></A>
Transition to the new state-wide clinical information system in November 2008 has impacted on the reporting of activity data. This is primarily due to a range of data entry, system performance and other change management issues rather than change in access to or output of services. The Mental Health Directorate initiated strategies to address these issues but as a consequence the capacity to accurately predict activity for 2009-10 was limited. It is anticipated that these issues will continue to impact upon data entry in 2010-11.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1011099"></A>
All that comes down to is this: they cannot guarantee that the figures that appear in the budget papers for 2009-10 are accurate and they cannot in any way predict or formulate what the figures will be in the 2010-11 financial year.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011100"></A>
This document highlights that the government has again failed to plan, yet from November 2008 it has had this system available to it. It is now June 2010, well over 18 months latter, and this government is still saying that the data in its own budget papers on mental health cannot be trusted. Mental health is a serious issue in our society and we need to tackle this on the basis that we get subacute services. To do that you have to have the right data. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government’s campaign on alerting people to mental health concerns may be well intended but, given this government’s record, what proportion will actually be spent on consultants and the like, and not find its way into the actual marketing campaign? Will it be only one-half of the budgeted amount? With all due respect, this government does not have a great record in regard to sticking to its promises, as we on this side of the House know and as people in the state are finding out to their great pain and suffering. In fact, if Labor’s marketing campaign is successful--and I hope it is--there will be an increased demand for community health service contacts and Labor will have to pick up its game in delivering those services. The first thing it will have to do is get the data right. Even its own documents say it cannot get it right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011105"></A>
In relation to dental services, there were 110,000 less occasions of dental service for children and adolescents in 2009-10 than budgeted for by the government and 93,050 less services than there were in 2008-09. That represents a 17 per cent decrease in important oral healthcare services. The government must explain why it is neglecting the oral health care of our children. The health minister stands in this House and continues to throw mud and smear the federal coalition, claiming it denied funding. As I understand it, the federal Labor government wants to scrap the Medicare chronic disease dental scheme, which offers up to $4,000 over two years to people with a chronic disease needing dental treatment. This government champions the fact that it is out there assisting people with chronic disease, but at the same time Labor says it wants that scheme scrapped. It cannot have it both ways. Either it supports people with chronic disease who are more likely to call upon our public health services than just about any other cohort in our society, or it does not. As I understand it, that is what this government is saying--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
--and the member knows it. Through the National Health and Hospitals Network there is available $484.5 million in operational funding over four years and $257.4 million in capital funding over four years, but only a small portion of that is able to be allocated in the next financial year. It is intriguing when one considers the supposed rollout of the hospital networks\local hospital boards and then reads the Senate transcripts of what the experts are saying in relation to who will be appointed to the hospital networks if the Labor government in this state continues in power.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011109"></A>
There is no doubt that this government would use that process to appoint its hacks, people who will cow down to it, rather than appoint people who are independent. This is becoming a real concern when one reads the Senate transcripts of the evidence of the experts who are coming forward to raise serious concerns about how the hospital networks will actually be run on the ground in the states under the control of Labor governments. The only government that stood up to this whole issue was Western Australia, which said, ‘Take your hands off our GST, we will look after it better.’ We have made it quite clear that, if we are elected, when we appoint men and women to local networks we will go to the peak bodies such as the AMAQ, the QNU, the LGAQ and other organisations to ensure we appoint rigorously independent people to chair those networks, and not hacks. Again, I suggest that members of this House read the Senate transcripts in relation to what is taking place at this time in regard to hospital networks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011110"></A>
It is perhaps testimony to this government’s inability to plan for the future when it cannot even put in place a payroll system, when it cannot even pay its own workers, because the minister does not like doctors and he does not want the nurses to be paid. He is happy to have them, hand in glove, down at the Salvation Army. That is actually what the government does. That is an indictment on this Labor government. Currently the nurses are volunteers working for this government and the minister knows it. The minister will not even stand up and fight for the nurses. He toes the party line. The greatest indictment on this government is the fact that it will not and cannot put in place a Health payroll system. If it cannot plan that, how, in any sense of the word, can it plan for the future of this state? It controls a $10 billion budget, but it cannot even pay the nurses what they are entitled to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011113"></A>
Equally concerning is the process being adopted by the QNU, the Queensland Nurses Union. The Queensland Nurses Union has simply taken the side of the government. It has adopted whatever this government says is the right thing to do. The QNU has failed to stand up for its members. As a consequence, its members are fed up with the QNU. The QNU has to understand that it represents the nurses and not the Labor Party, and it has to take some real and effective action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011114"></A>
I want to quickly move on to the Sunshine Coast and the issues that we are facing there. The issue of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital will be canvassed by other members from the Sunshine Coast, but I want to read a document from April 2009, titled ‘Sunshine Coast University Hospital Health Service Plan, Summary Document’, at page 16.4.4. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011148"></A>
The Queensland government is committed to the delivery of a 450-bed hospital on the Sunshine Coast in 2014, going to a 750-bed hospital at some point in time in the future. Current planning indicates the need for 685 multi-day beds and 83 same-day beds by 2016--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1011149"></A>
the proposed date that the new hospital will hopefully open--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011150"></A>
and 768 beds by 2016. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011152"></A>
That document was prepared by Queensland Health itself in April 2009. It shows quite clearly that the planning in relation to what has taken place has been woefully inadequate, poor and another example of exactly what this government is capable of--that is, the delivery of nothing but deficit, debt and deceit. I know the government will argue back and forth that these figures are wrong and that it has done further modelling. At the end of the day, there is no escaping the fact that this is a Queensland Health document prepared by its own people and shows a bed count well and truly above 450. </Hansard-Body>

Finally, two days ago I rose in the House to talk about the Caloundra aerodrome. Again, I say to the minister who is in the House today that this is an issue that should have been decided by the government. The government has palmed off to the Sunshine Coast Regional Council the obligation to make a determination as to whether or not that area should be sold. That, Minister, with respect, is an act of cowardice. You should have--they are trustee and the state government is the owner of the land. </Hansard-Body>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (10.52 am): I rise to speak on the government’s budget handed down by the Treasurer on Tuesday, 8 June. First, let me congratulate the opposition leader, John-Paul Langbroek, and shadow Treasurer, Tim Nicholls, for their budget reply speeches, and I commend them to the public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011163"></A>
In my 2009 budget reply speech I noted that the government had in recent years surfed the revenue waves of the GST, mining royalties, the swathe of stamp duties from a buoyant housing market and other sources. I noted that, despite record levels of revenue, somehow the government was able to turn riches into ruin for the state’s economy before the words ‘global financial crisis’ entered the public lexicon. I noted then that the government allowed growth in expenditure to exceed growth in revenue. Further, the government allowed a massive $65 billion to accumulate before the GFC. The Bligh-Fraser brand of economic mismanagement is unsustainable, and always has been, and the global financial crisis accentuated what was already a major problem. Yet still to this day the government tries to hide behind the global financial crisis to escape accountability for its actions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011164"></A>
As we turn our attention to the 2010-11 Labor state budget, what we see is more of the same. The budget is a typical Labor budget, with high debt levels, ongoing deficits, a big spend which is likely to be full of waste, and new and higher taxes on Queenslanders. The 2010-11 budget is also a miserly, mean-spirited one. The cost of living has skyrocketed due to Labor’s fuel tax, electricity price hike, car registration increases, boat and trailer registration increases, higher road tolls, hikes in public transport fares, water price rises, licence cost increases and the list goes on. The members opposite do not appreciate this accountability. After the massive hikes in the cost of living under Labor, the relief offered by this government is a paltry $24 a year cut in CTP insurance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011166"></A>
But let us pause a while and consider this major $24 CTP cut. It is actually much smaller mercies than presented by the Treasurer. The $24 CTP saving may not actually be a saving, as motor vehicle dealers will likely increase the cost of services in other areas or simply build the $24 into the sale price of a car. So in that case there is no saving at all. Then there are the insurance brokers who provide a full service offering, including CTP, to their clients and rely on this income stream to employ staff and run their business--so jobs and business viability are threatened. Also, many charitable, not-for-profit and sporting organisations get commissions for CTP for vehicles owned by their members and supporters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011169"></A>
Just recently I attended a Scripture Union chaplaincy dinner at the Redlands Sporting Club at Wellington Point. At that dinner, I and many others signed up to the CTP insurance plan so that the commissions would go to supporting the fine work that our chaplains do with our children in schools. It is bad enough that Scripture Union Queensland, the provider of chaplains for schools in Queensland, does not receive sufficient support from the state government and as such struggles to underwrite the provision of chaplaincy services. And now one of its funding streams will be cut by this heartless government, putting at risk the provision of some chaplaincy services. I ask the Treasurer to rethink Labor’s rushed and unfair CTP policy and why the exempt charities will somehow compensate them for their loss. Upon further consideration, it is clear that this 2010-11 budget is a miserly, mean-spirited one that does nothing to relieve the real cost of living pressures that Queenslanders have been subjected to by this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011172"></A>
I am sure we have all seen the recent ANZ bank TV ads that feature the character ‘Barbara from bank world’. In the ads Barbara cheats and deceives her customers, treating them with absolute contempt, and cares little for their needs. In one ad, a customer fronts up to Barbara’s bank to ask why they are being charged monthly account keeping fees. The customer explains that they originally signed up for an everyday account for which they were promised had no account keeping fees. Barbara explains to the bewildered customer that ‘no account keeping fees’ meant know with a ‘k’ in that she would not know about the fees until after they had been charged. The customer says she would never have opened an account at the bank if she had known about the account keeping fees in advance. And when a customer asks to see the manager because they are angry about the bad customer service, Barbara, the manager from bank world, does not want to know about the problem and will not fix it. In another ad, a very good customer at bank world approaches Barbara to collect a promised prize as part of a loyalty program only to find that Barbara would not keep her promise. The customer was misled and their loyalty was worth nothing to Barbara. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011173"></A>
Can I suggest today that there is one among us in this parliament who is worse than Barbara from bank world and that is ‘Anna from Bligh world’. Let me repeat that just in case members opposite missed it--‘Anna from Bligh world’. There are striking similarities between Barbara and this Queensland Premier. Between the two worlds they have created--bank world and Bligh world--</Hansard-Body>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Ms van Litsenburg): Order! Would the member for Cleveland address members by their proper title? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011177"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr ROBINSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Like Barbara, this Premier is mean-spirited in the way she has driven up the costs of living. Like Barbara, this Premier has been deceptive in the way she introduced a fuel tax without the consent of the people. Like Barbara, this Premier does not regard loyalty--just ask workers who are deceived about her asset sales program. Like Barbara, this Premier does not keep her promises. Her commitment to create 100,000 new bread-winning jobs is an empty promise, a cruel hoax, as the net job numbers are actually going backwards. And anything else in this budget is as tentative as receiving a kettle from Barbara in bank world. Bligh world is not a happy place. Bligh world is a place where Queenslanders wish they had not gone. Bligh world is a place that Queenslanders are desperately trying to leave. Perhaps the tax hungry Treasurer should consider a congestion tax on working families as they walk away from Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011178"></A>
This budget sees the continuation of a pattern of budget deficits--the fourth in fact. It continues to see the growth of state debt to the most unimaginable levels of the Hawke and Keating era. It took the Howard government almost a decade to pay off that Labor debt across the entire nation, but they had a debt repayment plan and they stuck to it. This government has nothing of the sought. It is quite happy to keep spending the hard earned money of Queenslanders without so much as a thought as to how all of this borrowed money will be paid back. Nobody believes the Treasurer’s throw away line that he will be able to bring the budget back into surplus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011214"></A>
Things are so bad that even New South Wales--which until recently was the basket case of the Australian states in terms of economies--has said in its 2010-11 budget that it will bring its budget back into surplus. But Queenslanders will have to wait for an LNP government before this Labor debt will be paid off. This state, once the envy of the nation, is now the embodiment of the banana republic. We are $83.5 billion in debt, which is over $18,000 for every man, woman and child. It is more than twice the peak state debt of Victoria. It is a situation born of this government’s absolute refusal to rein in its extreme and unsustainable levels of spending, particularly its refusal to curb public sector expansion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011218"></A>
The Treasurer has tried to claim debt is coming down, but his own budget papers confirm the opposite. Debt continues to rise to record levels of $83.5 billion. This high level of debt is like a ball and chain around the legs of every Queenslander and a millstone around the neck of the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011219"></A>
While the rest of the country rebounds into economic recovery, this Labor government is retarding our go-forward. One of the biggest retardants to our recovery is the government’s loss of Queensland’s AAA credit rating. The downgrading of our credit rating was brought about by the high debt level and out of control expenditure of this Labor government. The loss of our AAA rating has resulted in an increase in interest of in excess of $1 billion. What could be done with this money? This is an incredible waste of money. This budget does nothing to recover our AAA rating. Again, it will take an LNP government that is committed to paying back debt and controlling expenditure to do it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011221"></A>
This time last year those opposite stood condemned by the union backers and Queenslanders at large for betraying the trust placed in them as the government. They introduced a fuel tax, increased rego costs and announced the biggest sell-off of income-generating assets in Queensland’s history. One year on, despite the Premier’s best efforts to sell the sell-off, even with the help of taxpayer funded advertising campaigns, 85 per cent of Queenslanders maintain the rage. They are not convinced of the imminent need to sell these particular publicly owned assets at this time and in a fire sale, and neither should they be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011222"></A>
The government’s record on privatisation and deregulation is appalling. I of course refer to the failed deregulation of the Queensland electricity industry, with families across the state now facing the third double-digit rise in electricity prices in as many years. This of course comes after the government swore black and blue that, under a deregulated electricity market, Queenslanders would pay no more for power to their homes. So if the government botched the privatisation of energy, why would anyone believe they could successfully privatise ports, rail assets and motorways? It beggars belief.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011223"></A>
My own electorate of Cleveland is suffering the consequences of the government’s mishandling of the state’s economy. If not for Bligh Labor’s economic mismanagement, more funds would have been available for new major projects in Cleveland. Instead, very little return of taxpayer money will take place to my electorate as part of this budget. There is less available for building local infrastructure, improving transport links and supporting small business. Urgently needed local infrastructure has been overlooked, underfunded or scrapped. The lack of good transport infrastructure is a huge bugbear in my electorate. The Redlands currently relies very heavily on our single-track rail line for public transport. The duplication of the Manly-Cleveland line is badly needed. Still there is no commitment in sight from this government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011224"></A>
What is the government doing in the meantime to address the paucity of transport connections to Brisbane city in the Redlands? It is building the Eastern Busway. It is planned to run a dedicated busway link from the city through Buranda, Coorparoo and Carindale to eventually terminate at Capalaba. This is a vital piece of public transport infrastructure and one that my constituents would be thankful for, if stage 3 somehow could be brought forward sometime earlier than 2026. Now more than ever, Queensland needs to prioritise public transport, given this state has become the most expensive in the Commonwealth in which to own and operate a motor vehicle. RACQ spokesman Gary Fites told the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail </Hansard-Italic>
on 4 June--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011226"></A>
On top of the double whammy of scrapping the fuel subsidy and increased vehicle registration fees, motorists are increasingly being asked to put their hands in their pockets to pay for such things as the new smart drivers licence and tolls on roads, bridges and tunnels.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011227"></A>
It is an especially cruel irony that, while Queensland motorists are paying on average $220 more this year to stay on the road, the government has cut Main Roads and Transport spending by a quarter of a billion dollars. Motorists are being gouged out of existence while seeing an ever-diminishing return in road infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011229"></A>
In my electorate, the signalisation of Shore and Wellington streets once again appears to have been totally ignored, as have park-and-ride upgrades for Cleveland and Wellington Point stations. I call on the government to honour its promise at the last election to the people of Birkdale in my electorate of an extra 50 net parking spaces at the Birkdale station. The current plan that the government has is to break this promise and provide only 28 new spaces.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011230"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Nicholls:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Is anyone surprised?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011231"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr ROBINSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is no surprise at all. Cleveland by and large is a relatively safe place to live, work and raise a family. However, like elsewhere in Brisbane, it does have its areas that need a boost in police presence. Some parts of the northern Redlands have been identified by locals and the police as areas needing further focus, whether for car hooning, vandalism, graffiti, burglary or other crimes. These problems and others could be somewhat remediated with the establishment of a QPS shopfront at the Wellington Point town centre with its own police officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011232"></A>
One disappointment in this budget is that there is no recurrent funding for the Bayside Domestic Violence Initiative. The government thus far has refused to fund the Cleveland court’s only domestic violence support group, meaning that this week it is forced to spend the little money it has remaining to advertise in the local papers that it will be closing its doors. Victims of domestic violence in the Redlands who present at the Cleveland court will have no support from 30 June. This is a disgrace.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011234"></A>
Not only has this budget withheld funding from such needy groups in my electorate, but the government recently decided to actively take money from worthy community programs to prop up its own failing schemes. This was the case when the government raided the Gambling Community Benefit Fund to the tune of $10 million in May. The GCBF is a vital source of funding for charities, disability groups, sporting groups and other not-for-profit community groups in my electorate. Whoever came up with this idea is seriously twisted. They are like the low-life people who raid charity bins, stealing the clothes and other items that were meant for charities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011235"></A>
Can the Treasurer tell me which of the worthy recipients of the community benefit fund in my electorate who recently received funding should miss out? What about the Redland District Special School in Thornlands, a fantastic school for disabled children that is underresourced, that received special needs walkers and chairs? Or perhaps the Panda Playgroup at Birkdale could have done without the new playground equipment for the children? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011238"></A>
Last month the health minister came out to Redland Hospital in my electorate. He was there to announce that three new nurse practitioners had started work at the hospital. The only problem was that the nurses had already started work in June 2009, a full year ago, so it was a typical Labor recycled announcement with the pretence of being something new--like some of the current budget items. While at the hospital, the health minister was challenged about his apparent reprioritising of a $640,000 election promise to build a helipad at the hospital. I surely hope he is going to keep that promise and further honour the other elements of the emergency department upgrade. His vacillating on the helipad casts a shadow of doubt on the other promises.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011239"></A>
The Redland Hospital is in urgent need of investment in supportive infrastructure to increase car parking spaces and build the northern ring road around the hospital precinct. Anyone who has visited the hospital can attest to the parlous state of the current car park. Illegal parking on verges and embankments and double parking has become commonplace because the demand for spaces has outstripped supply by several times. The health minister himself made a tacit acknowledgement of the situation during his visit when he flat out refused to be photographed in front of the car park--he was that ashamed of it. The Redland Hospital does not need the health minister’s platitudes; it needs his action. This government also does not appear to have addressed the need for a palliative care unit at Redland Hospital. The government has failed to listen to the growing number of locals calling for a dedicated unit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011240"></A>
Positive environmental outcomes are important to the people of the Redlands. As a marine science graduate, I have a high level of interest in how the government’s marine and fisheries policies affect my bayside electorate. Before the last election, the government promised to build six artificial reefs within the three-year election period. Currently, only one--really only half; it is not a new one--has been established, Harry Atkinson Reef. It was a memorable episode last September when the sustainability minister went against all common sense and maritime services advice and sent the <Hansard-Italic>
Tiwi Pearl</Hansard-Italic>
 ahead of schedule into a storm to avoid boaties and fishers in Manly who were planning to challenge the government about its anti-fishing policies. The storm that the minister sent the <Hansard-Italic>
Tiwi Pearl</Hansard-Italic>
 into caused it to sink ahead of time in a fiasco and drift to an unintended location.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011278"></A>
For some time the minister could not even find her new reef. On one hand it was very entertaining to watch this amateur minister pretend to boaties and recreational fishers that she knew what she was doing, but, on the other hand, boaties and fishers took it seriously that the minister really believes that the government’s artificial reef program, if and when it is complete, is fair compensation to them for the loss of 70 to 80 per cent of the best fishing areas of the bay as green zones. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011279"></A>
Regarding the other five artificial reefs, while I cannot find any direct funding commitment in the budget papers for the continuation of the artificial reef program, I hope the minister will stay true to her word and establish these reefs before the next election. The boaties and anglers of bayside Brisbane are watching. They will not accept any excuses from this minister, whom they are already wary of. The minister has earned a reputation among fishermen as the landlubbing greenie with no idea of the needs of the bay and those who use it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011280"></A>
Who knows what extreme green solutions will come about for the bay during the next election campaign, when the Premier--if she is still Premier--will be even more desperate for the Green preferences that she cannot beat the LNP without. We need Moreton Bay to be sustainable for future generations, but the way Labor has gone about securing these outcomes is wrong. The LNP will pursue conservation based on hard scientific evidence, not greasy, under-the-table preference deals with fringe parties before election time. I will continue to advocate for a comprehensive marine fishery study to be conducted in Moreton Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011282"></A>
What about Straddie? North Stradbroke Island is a place of fantastic and natural beauty and home to a significant population and good number of plant and animal species that are unique to the area. In particular, there is a native population of koalas that do not have the same level of disease as other koala populations, thankfully. More research needs to be conducted about this unique koala population. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011283"></A>
Then there is a range of other areas of research in terms of the environment that are needed in my electorate. There is also the need for a national park, which I continue to call for, for North Stradbroke Island. The government has been high on the rhetoric and talk and low on the delivery with this long-awaited national park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011284"></A>
In closing, I think back to Barbara from Bank World. Whatever happened to the customer who was conned? Well, she leaves Bank World and enters another world, a better world. Ultimately, it is only by leaving ‘Bligh World’ behind that things will get better for Queensland. Only by leaving ‘Bligh World’ will things get better. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (11.12 am): I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill 2010. This is a budget which delivers for the people of the Bulimba electorate and it delivers for the people of Queensland. The Bligh Labor government has had to make some tough decisions in the last 12 months. It has made absolutely the right decisions about continuing its investment in infrastructure, not only to cater for our rapid population growth but also to ensure that the economy could keep moving in the face of the worst global economic crisis our country has faced for decades. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011289"></A>
These were not economic times that any government would like to be faced with and they were not decisions that any government would enjoy being faced with. But thank goodness it was the Bligh Labor government that was in charge and having to make the decisions and not the LNP! Thank goodness it was a government that could strike out with a clearly thought out, long-term strategy, despite the criticism, and that it understood what was ahead of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011290"></A>
As I listened to the opposition leader’s speech yesterday offering no costings, no details and no way forward, I shuddered at the thought of what might have happened to us all in Queensland if the LNP had been in charge. We simply cannot use the words ‘LNP’ and ‘plan’ or ‘LNP’ and ‘policy’ in the same sentence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011291"></A>
The Bligh Labor government has received wide support for its commitment to the $17.1 billion infrastructure program. It has received praise from significant stakeholders who are in a position to know exactly what is happening in their industries. The Property of Council of Queensland said that the industry is positive about the budget, that the sector will benefit from major infrastructure spending and stable property taxes and that it is a very good thing for property investors and property owners. The Australian Industry Group said that the budget provides a strong platform for economic growth. It said that it is very significant indeed that we continue to have strong spending in infrastructure. The state government has literally been the only show in town as far as infrastructure has gone, and without it our state would have been in a dire situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011294"></A>
There is no doubt that the Bulimba electorate has benefited from the infrastructure program. Only weeks ago the first major tranche of the program came to fruition with the opening of the $1.7 billion Gateway Upgrade Project comprising a second Gateway Bridge river crossing and increased capacity on the Gateway Motorway between Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road and Nudgee Road. The pedestrian and cycleway will be open very soon and all of the lanes will be opened by August. This project is a major congestion buster and ticks all the boxes in terms of its contribution to the economy through jobs creation--6,000 jobs--its positive impact on traffic and its green credentials. It makes a difference on a daily basis to the residents of my local area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011295"></A>
It is the government’s wise economic decisions which have allowed us to do what governments should be doing--to fund the things that are important to our local communities that are, after all, made up of the people we have been elected to represent. It has allowed us to fund major initiatives in education, in transport and in health, to support the people who are disadvantaged in our society and to make sure that we have a physical environment which future generations can enjoy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011296"></A>
In the electorate of Bulimba, transport is one of the biggest issues. We are an inner-urban area with increasing density. Unlike many other electorates, our transport needs can be serviced by ferry, train and bus services but we face significant traffic congestion and public transport pressures in the same way that many South-East Queensland electorates do and we are feeling the effects of the 2,000 people moving to our corner of the state each week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011298"></A>
There is much to talk about in terms of what the government has done to recognise those transport and congestion pressures. The government is committed to tackling congestion by investing in public transport, with record funding of $7 billion in this year’s budget. For my local area this is about: a $60 million boost for rail services, fully funding 3,748 services per week, including on the Cleveland line; a $50 million boost for bus services, providing 60 per cent of the funding for the 53,600 services per week delivered by the Brisbane City Council; $174 million to continue building 64 new three-carriage passenger trains; $150 million to extend the Eastern Busway from Buranda to Main Avenue, Coorparoo; and commuters using go cards saving on average 30 per cent on the price of paper tickets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011300"></A>
Importantly, and most excitingly, for the 1,863 commuters who pass through the station each day, the Morningside Railway Station will receive an upgrade to the tune of $950,000 as part of the government’s $200 million program to upgrade train stations across the south-east. This will mean new electronic screens, better seating, improved signage, toilet upgrades, fresh painting and industrial cleaning. The last time this station received an upgrade was in 2005, when 63 new parking spaces were added to the already high-capacity car park. This was greatly welcomed, though the capacity has been quickly taken up by the increasing numbers of commuters using this pivotal railway station. I go to the station on a regular basis to talk to commuters and I know that they are going to be very excited about this initiative. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. This has been approved by the Speaker. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1011302"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011303"></A>
These commitments will add to the already impressive list of improvements to public transport in my local area in recent times, including:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1011304"></A>
•	An overall increase of 10,500 places on the Cleveland line in the last two years</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<A ID="pgfId-1011307"></A>
•	An additional 69 CityCat services since February; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<A ID="pgfId-1011308"></A>
•	A new bus shelter at Cannon Hill railway station.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011309"></A>
Mr Speaker the Bligh Labor Government funds 100% of rail services in South East Queensland and 60% of Brisbane City Council buses.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011310"></A>
I loved the speech from the Minister for Transport this week, Mr Speaker, when she challenged Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman to match funding 50/50 for Brisbane buses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011311"></A>
Her speech was a very interesting expose of what Council actually does for public transport. Many residents of the Bulimba electorate would in fact be very interested to know--as it’s contrary to the propaganda that the Lord Mayor issues--that in fact he has steadily cut the Brisbane City Council’s share of funding to buses over the last six years, while the Bligh Government has moved in the opposite direction, with increased funding to $91 million in 2008-09. In fact, the State Government will fund every one of the 125 new buses Council will build in 2010-11.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011312"></A>
Mr Speaker I am sure I am not the only Government Member who was incredulous at many of the speeches from LNP members in this House yesterday when they were talking about the City of Brisbane Act. Many of them used the opportunity to praise the investment in public transport that was being made by the Brisbane City Council. This was empty praise, without any doubt. I, for one, am a little tired of the Brisbane City Council taking credit for the astonishing investment that the Queensland Government makes in public transport in Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011313"></A>
Mr Speaker, there are few in the Bulimba electorate who would dispute the importance of the Government’s education and training initiatives. The first that springs to mind is the focus on early childhood which will see the construction of 240 new kindergartens by 2014, including the accelerated planning and delivery of 40 kindergarten services originally scheduled for 2013 and 2014, to open a total of 86 services in 2012. And these kindergartens will be solar-powered, Mr Speaker, in line with the Government’s commitment to do the Bright Thing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011314"></A>
The Bulimba electorate will benefit from the kindergarten initiative alone, with plans already being developed for a double-unit kindergarten on the grounds of the Seven Hills state school. I know how popular this initiative is because when I wrote out to locals to let them know about it, they jammed the phones in my office with inquiries. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011315"></A>
And I know the $28,725 for a kindergarten program at Tricia’s Playschool, at a total cost of $86,175, is well received--as is the $30,852 to assist the Hawthorne Limited hours Care child care service with a total state Government contribution of $92,556. These services are desperately needed, and the Government has responded. It’s as simple as that. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011316"></A>
The Government is focused on giving a Flying Start to Queensland children. It recognises that children are our future. That if you give kids the best opportunities as early as possible in life, then they are more likely to live a happy and fulfilling life as adults. That’s why initiatives like the Ready Reader program are so important, and the social marketing campaigns to encourage kids to read to their kids. The link between reading and literacy is irrefutable. And the parents and teachers of the Bulimba electorate are very enthusiastic about these initiatives.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011317"></A>
In our schools, we are going gang-busters. In 2010-2011 the Government will provide $28.5 million to booster literacy and numeracy skills through intensive teaching, summer schools, literacy and numeracy coaches and professional development for teachers; it will provide $19.5 million for science teaching through the Science Spark program; it will invest $207 million to complete the State Schools of tomorrow program for new and renewed facilities program. And it will employ 316 additional teachers and teachers aides. Mr Speaker this year’s Budget will deliver $174,411 to Balmoral SHS, at a total cost of $692,797, to rejuvenate its science block. This is an excellent school in our local area. It is a strong community in its own right, with parents, teachers and students so proud of their achievements, and they were over the moon when I told them about this funding boost.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011318"></A>
I know that the feedback on the Flying Start for QLD children initiative will guide the development in 2010-2011 of future reforms. Mr Speaker the people of the Bulimba electorate have been very involved in providing feedback on these reforms. I have had fulsome comments from a huge range of community members, and have and will faithfully feed this back to the Minister. I know for instance that, during my own consultation, parents and teachers were describing the need for more support for young parents to guide them in effective parenting skills--and so it was with great pleasure that I saw the initiative in the Budget which provides for that very service. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011319"></A>
Looking at the point at which our children become adults, and then throughout their lives, the Government is instituting some exciting initiatives to skill the workforce of tomorrow. We have already benefited enormously from the $106 million Skilling Queenslanders for Work initiative, which delivered 24 000 jobs in 2010-2011. Mr Speaker our local area has benefited greatly from the Government’s focus on skills. In the last year our local area has seen projects funded which have benefited important local icons such as the Cannon Hill and Morningside School of Arts, and schools such as Cannon Hill SS and Bulimba SS. The latter is a school we hold up high as an excellent example of the Green Army initiative of the Government--an innovative program which focuses on both jobs and the environment. And our other local schools are interested in this project too, and I hope to see future projects funded under this excellent initiative.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Building on these achievements, the Government will now establish an industry-led Queensland Skills Commission which will drive training investment and skills reform, with the Government providing (i) more than $500 million for vocational education and training, including apprenticeships and traineeships, through TAFE institute, the Australian Agricultural College corporation and private registered training organisations; and (ii) $133.3 million for training infrastructure to improve and develop trade training facilities in places which include South Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker the economic plan which the Government has in place has also meant we can deliver for our environment. The Queensland Government has an excellent track record in delivering programs and resources that will assist individuals and organisations, communities, schools and businesses to do their best to reduce their carbon footprint--programs that the Bulimba electorate has taken full advantage of--like the Green Army, EcoBiz, the Low Carbon Diet, the ClimateSmart Home Service, the ClimateSmart Retail Program and the ClimateSmart Business Program, the Solar Hot Water Scheme and the Solar Energy Bonus Scheme.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011322"></A>
This Budget will deliver more, with a $965 million budget to protect our environment and natural resources and build climate change resistance--including new programs to reduce waste and promote recycling; $115 million for solar power projects, including $5.8 million for solar power in kindergartens; and more national parks, nature refuges and ranges as well as increased koalas and native regrowth protection.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011323"></A>
Mr Speaker I hear from many people in the Bulimba electorate that life is tough. The Global Economic Crisis has hit families, and I am pleased to see that the Government is responding. The State Government already had in place a number of initiatives to give a helping hand to people in need--like the half price car registration fees for pensioners, the solar energy rebates, the increase to the South East Queensland Pensioner Water Subsidy Scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011324"></A>
The Budget announcement of a drop in CTP insurance on car registration will make a big difference to people Mr Speaker. And it is very interesting to hear from the LNP that they don’t think the $24 cut amounts to much. Well clearly they don’t get in and amongst their constituents because I meet a lot of people to whom $24 is a lot of money, and who would be insulted to think that LNP Members were deriding any relief they might feel in knowing about this cut.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011325"></A>
The Budget also details a $12.6 million increase for electricity rebates for seniors, and land tax exemption for supported accommodation. This is a Government which is listening, which is responsive, and which is spending money where Government should be spending money.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1011333"></A>
The Bulimba electorate is very close and caring community. I know it’s important to local residents that they are looking after each other, and I know they will be very happy to see money allocated towards the people who need it the most.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011334"></A>
I know they will be especially pleased to see the acknowledgement of the important role that Foodbank plays in supporting the most vulnerable in our community. This wonderful facility feeds 70,000 people a week, half of whom are children. Recently I had great pleasure in confirming to them a new 3 year allocation of over $500,000 a year in support from the QLD Government. This Budget will now deliver an additional $250,000 a year, ensuring they have $3 million over four years. As their General Manager said to me when I gave him the news, “this will mean more people can go to bed at night with food in their stomachs”.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011335"></A>
But Mr Speaker it is the Government’s courageous commitment to creating and maintaining jobs, and to furthering the skills of Queenslanders, which will ensure that we are positioned to take advantage of the eventual global economic recovery, that we can return to surplus--and that, most importantly, we can then ensure we are providing for the things that are important to our community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011336"></A>
At the last election the Premier set a target of creating 100,000 new jobs by the next election. What a vision that was, and she has spent every single day since that last election working to ensure that that vision can come true. I know the Premier was derided for her ambitious plan. Yet here we today, celebrating the fact that Queensland has generated jobs for the tenth month in a row. There have been 8800 new jobs in Queensland this month--the most of any state; and 8200 of them full time jobs. And our jobs target today stands at 50,700--we are half way towards our commitment. And is this good news to the LNP? No, absolutely not. They cannot put aside politics for long enough to celebrate the fact that 8800 more Queenslanders now have a job. That 8800 more Queenslanders can put food on the table and educate and clothe their children and look forward to the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011337"></A>
Mr Speaker the Government’s commitment to a stronger Queensland is about initiatives like the new $18 million exploration program to support the resource industry; the $17.1 billion capital works program--supporting 106,000 jobs; the extension of the 125% payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees; and the new Skills Commission to tackle skills shortages; the $4000 Regional First Home Owner Boost to support house construction outside South East Queensland. And so much more.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011338"></A>
I know our own local area benefited from the strong economic plans of the Government, with the funding that was allocated to Raytheon Australia to establish the Aerospace Centre for Excellence in Murarrie. Queensland is recognized as the aviation hub in Australia, and initiatives like this help to position the industry for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011339"></A>
This was a solid Budget which will lead us through still trouble times to surplus and economic recovery. It is slow and steady. It is strategic and well-informed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011340"></A>
I congratulate the Premier for her leadership through an incredibly difficult period for our State. I congratulate the Treasurer for his strength and intelligence in devising this Budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (11.17 am): The 2010 state budget rebuilds the Queensland economy after the ravages of the global financial crisis and economic uncertainty. Last year’s budget brought an economic plan to provide short-term protection from unemployment with a Capital Works Program to create 127,000 Queensland jobs and a long-term strategy to return the budget to surplus and reduce government debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011344"></A>
This budget delivers on that plan. Unemployment in Queensland was expected to peak at 7 per cent this year but will now peak at 5 per cent and return to five per cent in the 2012 financial year. This means that hundreds and thousands of Queensland families have been able to maintain employment and income during this downturn. I know that this is something valued by the people of the Waterford electorate, who work hard to hold on to their employment security and the dignity and self-respect that comes with work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011345"></A>
Yesterday’s job figures show that Queensland was once again the biggest jobs generator in Australia. Almost half of the 18,400 jobs created in Australia last month were created in Queensland. In one month, 8,800 jobs were created for Queenslanders. This result means 10 consecutive months of jobs creation in Queensland. The Queensland government remains committed to meeting our jobs target of 100,000 jobs in three years. With 49,300 jobs created to date, we are almost halfway there in 15 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011346"></A>
Our economic plan and investment in infrastructure will also see a return to strong growth in Queensland, with growth for the coming year expected to be at three per cent, increasing to 3 per cent in the following years. This economic growth shows not only the importance of public spending on infrastructure but also the confidence of business to bring investment and jobs to our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011403"></A>
This state budget also delivers another strong infrastructure program. This program is the Queensland government’s job-creating stimulus strategy. Infrastructure spending of $17 billion over the budget year will support 106,000 jobs. The alternative to this economic plan is a stark choice. The LNP went to the state election promising to cut 12,000 public sector jobs each year and every year. An LNP government would have reduced public sector jobs by 24,000 by this second budget of the 53rd Parliament. Cutting jobs and cutting services does not help families, but this is the alternative the LNP put to the Queensland government’s economic plan.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011406"></A>
The tough decisions of 2009 also mean that the Queensland government can return to surplus sooner than expected. This budget continues with strict financial management to ensure that expenditure is kept under tight reins. This fiscal discipline means that the Queensland budget will return to surplus 12 months ahead of schedule and government debt will be lower than expected in future years. This is a responsible budget, returning Queensland to strength and security after the global financial crisis. When you see that pokies turnover dropped last year, the first time since pokies were licensed, you understand that families are hurting from the economic downturn. While poker machine losses in Logan are still of concern to me, April’s losses represented a decrease of $800,000 compared with the same time last year for that area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011407"></A>
The opposition leader’s contribution to this debate should be seen for the cheap politicking, the whining and carping that it is. When Labor is rebuilding the state’s finances, he says that we should be reducing taxes and spending more on infrastructure. Queenslanders will see through this. They know from their own budget that, in the end, you can only spend what comes in the door. The opposition is opposed to everything but does not put forward an economic plan, preferring to hide as small targets. But as the government’s economic plan begins to deliver a stronger economy for Queensland, there is an opportunity for Queenslanders to share in the dividends of that renewed economic strength. Many Queensland families have felt the financial pressure of the global financial crisis. As the government’s fiscal position returns to strength, Queenslanders will see more infrastructure, more services and assistance with the family budget. After having my speech approved by the Speaker, I seek leave to have the remainder of it incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

This Budget will help pensioners and seniors concession card holders with a 13.8% increase in the electricity rebate, increasing the rebate to $216.21 per annum. This rebate will be matched by the Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Concession Scheme--providing the same rebate for people with medical conditions that require temperature control, such as Multiple Sclerosis.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011411"></A>
Electricity consumers have felt the cost of rising energy prices that reflect the increased costs of providing a reliable power supply across the retail, distribution and generation sectors. Any extra support the Queensland Government can provide for electricity prices will be warmly welcomed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011412"></A>
As well as concessions, the Queensland Government is helping energy consumers to reduce their consumption with rebates for solar hot water and solar power. This budget provides $115 million over five years for solar initiatives to double our solar energy over the next five years. By helping consumers to switch to solar, we can cut energy bills and help families to reduce their carbon emissions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011413"></A>
The Budget also delivers a reduction of $24 per year in the CTP component of vehicle registration costs. Pensioners will also continue their concession for vehicle registration, for most pensioners, this is a discount of 50% of the registration component. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As a growing outer urban area, Logan and Beenleigh are dependent on continued investment in road and transport infrastructure for not only work and business, but for quality of life. Improvements to road and transport infrastructure means more time with family and friends and less time getting to and from work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011418"></A>
This Budget continues a strong record of investment in road infrastructure in the Waterford electorate. The centrepiece of our investment is the delivery of the $210 million upgrade to the Loganlea Road interchange on the M1. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011419"></A>
This project is well underway, providing hundreds of jobs into our economy. I thank local residents for their patience and understanding during the construction period. By the end of next year, it will be worth it with better access to the M1 and better flow on the Motorway. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011420"></A>
Planning for future expansions is also underway. The Budget includes $6.07 million in joint federal and state funding for planning and land acquisition on Section C the Pacific Motorway Upgrade, between Daisy Hill and Loganholme. The upgrade to the Logan Motorway is also funded again this year. These measures mean that we are planning for future growth in our area, here and now. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1011421"></A>
The planning and design of the Slacks Creek park and ride facility at Nujooloo Road will continue this financial year, providing more than 200 car parks for commuters using busway services. This facility will also relieve parking pressure at the popular Logan Hyperdome bus station.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011422"></A>
While these large projects are underway, this Budget delivers improvements to important local roads, improving the accessibility of our streets. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011423"></A>
During the 2009 election, a number of residents in Beenleigh approached me for improvements to the intersection of Beenleigh-Beaudesert Road and Tallagandra Road. Along with Margaret Keech, I have been lobbying Main Roads Minister Craig Wallace about the need to address the congestion and safety at this intersection. This Budget delivers $1.2 million for traffic lights and much needed improvements at this intersection. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011424"></A>
Waterford-Tamborine Road is another busy road, servicing more cars from the growing areas to the south of Waterford. Waterford-Tamborine Road will be improved during this Budget year, with $250,000 allocated for widening and sealing of shoulders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011425"></A>
But this Budget is not just about more roads. With six train stations in my electorate, it is great to see the construction of 102 new three carriage units for the Citytrain network, with 64 of these units having already been contracted for delivery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Queensland Government is delivering great improvements in health and family services, with hospital upgrades and parking upgrades, better support for parents in their own homes as well as family support initiatives to protect children.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011429"></A>
I am very excited by the announcement that Logan and Beenleigh mothers with newborn babies will receive up to six home visits from registered nurses as part of the Helping Out Families pilot program. This pilot program will operate in trial areas across Logan and the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011430"></A>
Early intervention means that we can give young children the best chance in life. Mothers with newborn babies will have up to six initial visits over a three year period with a registered nurse. Those families that need intensive help will receive up to fifteen home visits within the first 12 months. Longer term follow up will be provided by the Family Support Alliance.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011431"></A>
It is disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition would criticise the notion that the benefits of the Queensland Government’s economic management should be spent on this important initiative.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011432"></A>
These are the support services that Logan has wanted. For many parents, this will provide a little bit of extra support when they are coping with a newborn child. But these services mean that we can support vulnerable families, rather than let Child Safety pick up the pieces in sometimes tragic circumstances. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011433"></A>
The Budget also delivers on our 2009 election commitment to upgrade the Logan Hospital. Our commitment to expand mental health acute services and outpatient specialist facilities is being delivered, with construction underway for outpatient facilities in the former Logan Private Hospital building. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011434"></A>
Planning is progressing on the $44 million expansion of the Logan Hospital emergency department. This will see 18 new emergency department beds and a separate children’s waiting area. This will be a welcome improvement for one of Queensland’s busiest emergency departments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011435"></A>
The Budget also includes $1 million to redesign the Logan Hospital car park to provide 200 extra spaces for staff, patients and their families. Parking during peak periods has been a concern for local residents for some time. In the almost four years I have been a local MP, I have received many questions about the hospital car park and have raised it with every Health Minister. It is great to see that there is some welcome relief for visitors to the hospital.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011436"></A>
Queensland’s health budget this year is a massive $9.9 billion, almost doubling over the last five years. Getting our fair share of this budget means more nurses, more doctors and better preventative health services in Logan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011437"></A>
But while we appreciate investment locally, the introduction of four new persistent pain clinics, including a clinic at the PA Hospital, will be welcomed by those in our community who suffer chronic pain. A specialist clinic at the PA Hospital will be accessible by Logan residents who at the moment have to wait for an appointment and travel to the Royal Brisbane Hospital.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011438"></A>
Beenleigh and Logan are also fortunate to have many family and social support programs delivered by community organisations. Among the many much-needed services, this Budget funds the Beenleigh Senior Citizens Centre Home and Community Care services for $1.47 million for allied health care, centre based care, home maintenance, meals on wheels and respite care. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011439"></A>
Caroline Fitzpatrick and the Centacare team at the Domestic Violence Assistance Program at the Beenleigh Courthouse will offer support with more than $264,000 to provide support for women seeking domestic violence prevention orders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011440"></A>
As well, the Social Inclusion pilot program based at Youth and Family Services will receive $1.8 million this financial year. This project provides intensive case management to young parents and young people with a mental illness. This project is delivering important innovations in service delivery, including coordinated case management across service agencies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011441"></A>
There are many more services to support vulnerable people in our community. While they are too many to mention individually, I can assure residents that the Queensland Government is investing in supporting families and children to meet the challenges of some of the difficult times of their life.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011442"></A>
We are also doing more to address the important issue of housing affordability. This Government has already removed stamp duty for first home owners purchasing a home under $500,000. But this budget will see the rollout of social housing for those people who can’t afford the private rental market. This new social housing, mostly one or two bedroom units, will be perfect for seniors on fixed incomes who find the private rental market too much to bear. With an ageing population and great access to medical services and public transport, Beenleigh is the perfect place for housing for seniors to be delivered.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011443"></A>
I know that the Premier has understood the challenges facing many Logan residents. Even though economic times are tough, the Queensland Government is providing a hand up to those in need.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011444"></A>
As well, the ULDA planning process for Yarrabilba and Flagstone will mean more new houses available in our area for home buyers getting into the property market. But this growth in housing comes at a cost and we are building the infrastructure to support new homes in our community. This Budget includes $17.8 million to provide a reliable energy supply network, with upgrades to the Meadowbrook, Bethania and Beenleigh substations and the construction of a new transmission line from Loganlea to Jimboomba.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Queensland Government has driven a strong agenda to build a modern and strong education system. We have delivered the new prep year, are rolling out the Ready Readers program and delivering 240 new kindergartens.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011447"></A>
Education funding makes up almost 25% of the State Budget with $9.5 billion allocated this year. This means more kindergartens, more teachers and more teacher aides supporting Queensland’s school children.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011448"></A>
The benefit of this investment can be seen in our local schools and the new kindergartens. This Budget delivers two kindergarten services at Logan Reserve State School which will open in 2012. This Budget also includes $43,500 for the Logan TAFE Community Child Care at Meadowbrook to provide an approved kindergarten program for children in the year prior to Prep for 15 hours a week and at least forty weeks per year, at a total cost of $130,500.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011450"></A>
The State Budget will also deliver more than 316 extra teachers and teacher aides. Better school facilities will also be delivered, with $400,000 for the construction school industry trade centre at Beenleigh State High School as well as $1.6 million for renewal of libraries and general learning areas across Beenleigh State High School, Loganlea State High School, Mabel Park State School and Waterford West State School. The Budget also includes allocations for school maintenance including a $36,800 allocation for Loganholme State School maintenance projects this financial year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011451"></A>
Just as we are supporting home-owners to do the bright thing and go for solar power, we are continuing to roll-out our solar schools program and making kindies solar kindies. These programs can both reduce the impact on the school’s budget of solar power and educate young people about the opportunities for clean energy from solar power.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011452"></A>
The Budget also is another brick in building to the State Government Towards Q2 target of 50% of Queenslanders having a trade or higher qualification by 2020. There is more than $500 million for apprenticeship and training opportunities for Queenslanders, providing the ability for people to start a career or to upskill in their existing career.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I also congratulate Minister Geoff Wilson on the announcement of an independent skills commission for Queensland, similar to Skills Australia. This is an important initiative to ensure that the training we are providing is going to provide real jobs for young people. Young people and their parents want to know that the course they are buying is providing a career that is in demand from industry. This Commission will give industry and workers the confidence that training is relevant to industry and the jobs of tomorrow.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Of course, this is all assisted by the extension of the 125% payroll rebate for apprentices and trainees. This was a proposal to encourage employers to take on apprentices during the downturn but has proven a successful way to reward those employers who are doing the right thing and training the tradespeople of the future. This measure has my full support.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1011456"></A>
This Budget also delivers more police officers, ambulance officers and firefighters to keep our community safe. A massive $1.67 billion budget for Community Safety, a $110 million increase, will deliver 203 new police positions, taking the total number of police officers to 10,400 for the first time, as well as 75 new ambulance officers and 24 extra firefighters.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Locally, extra funding has been made available for the refurbishment and expansion of the Beenleigh police station at a total cost of $3.45 million. This project has taken longer than expected due to the expansion of the scope of the construction. I can assure local residents I will be continuing to lobby Police Minister Neil Roberts to deliver this project as a priority for local residents.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

There are two realities for Queensland. First, we have a higher proportion of small business than any other state in Australia. Second, we have to be innovative to remain globally competitive and keep jobs in Australia. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011461"></A>
So often, small business owners spend a lot of time running their business and don’t get the chance to look at improving the way they deliver their services or products.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011462"></A>
Small and medium enterprises will be able to apply for up to $50,000 to access research and expert advice on improving their business, not only creating strong small business but providing more jobs for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011463"></A>
In conclusion, I support the 2010 Queensland State Budget, as a strategy that protects jobs now and returns to surplus in the medium term. While there have been some tough decisions to get to this point, we are on the way back to strength. This Budget gets the balance right: a fiscally responsible Budget that delivers the quality services that Queenslanders deserve. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Powell): Order! Before I call the member for Toowoomba North, I want to acknowledge and welcome to the public gallery students of the Southbank Institute of TAFE.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011467"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (11.21 am): This is indeed a fair dinkum Labor budget. It is a fair dinkum Labor budget because it concentrates on maintaining and creating jobs for Queenslanders while at the same time being very financially responsible. In my own electorate there is evidence of the emphasis on creating jobs, and those items of government expenditure are now listed on my website and have been covered by the media. I will incorporate that list towards the end of my speech.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011470"></A>
The thrust of the opposition’s comments over recent times not just with respect to this budget but over recent years and particularly from my friend the member for Toowoomba South has been criticism of what he regards as Labor’s debt and deficit. Clearly, the deficit, as has been explained by the Treasurer, is primarily a direct result of the effects of the global economic crisis. As for the opposition’s response from the Leader of the Opposition, we heard his so-called ‘plan’. Of course that plan did not explain how, by expending more money and by freezing taxes, that deficit would be reduced. In fact, in all respects, his speech was bewildering so far as any attempt to attack the debt or deficit of the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011474"></A>
It is the case that Queensland’s need for services, hence the need to raise money, has come about as a result of our greatly increased population. If one looks at the budget papers one can see the charts that indicate the growth rate of Queensland’s population. It has an average growth rate of 2.3 per cent--way above its nearest rival Western Australia at 1.9 per cent and starkly compares with New South Wales at one per cent. This has been occurring of course over a number of years. This means that we do experience economic growth because of the demand caused by these people coming into our state, but of course the demand for services and infrastructure has also risen. The necessary response to that has been the indication of the increased infrastructure spending in Queensland, and I refer to chart 3.9 on page 53 of the budget papers which indicates the increase in the expenditure on infrastructure and, accordingly, associated debt.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011476"></A>
This increase in expenditure has of course been supported by the opposition. If one goes back to the budget debates of 2004 one can see quite readily that the opposition supported the spending on additional infrastructure in all respects. In fact, it bemoaned the fact that the government had not spent enough and it encouraged the government to spend more money with respect to infrastructure generally. I refer to my friend the member for Toowoomba South’s contribution in that debate on 17 June 2004 where he said that in fact there had been chronic underfunding of capital works. He went on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011479"></A>
... the problem we have is that our infrastructure deficit is getting too far back for us to catch up unless there is a massive turnaround in the budgeting process.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1011480"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011482"></A>
Unless we have the infrastructure--the roads, the public transport systems, the water supply, the industrial processes, the industrial estates, the port, train and trucking terminals--working well, and unless we have that coat hanger of infrastructure for the economy to hang from, then we will certainly never be able to provide the jobs and social requirements that the state needs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Bold>
A government member:</Hansard-Bold>
 How true!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011484"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 How true. Not only was it the member for Toowoomba South who supported that line of action, but the then Leader of the Opposition--the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011488"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Moorhead:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 And future Leader of the Opposition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011489"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And future Leader of the Opposition, as my friend from Waterford predicts. He bemoaned that there was not enough money being spent on roads, on tourism, on water supply. He went on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011491"></A>
Regarding infrastructure, the young people of tomorrow will not just be asking why they cannot get a job; they will be asking other questions too. They will be asking: why do we have constant power blackouts? They will be asking: why are we always on water restrictions? They will be asking: why does it take so long to travel anywhere? They will be asking: why are the roads so congested? These are the types of questions that will be asked, because these are the very issues the Labor Party has failed to address.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011492"></A>
What we did as a result in ensuing years was definitely to address those issues of infrastructure. As a consequence, you have to borrow in order to address those issues. We did exactly what the member for Toowoomba South and the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition wanted us to do--that is, to spend more and more and more on infrastructure to meet the challenge of the increased population coming from interstate. They now want us to forget what they said six years ago, but I can assure the honourable member for Toowoomba South that every time he raises in the future any allegation of what he refers to as ‘Labor’s debt and deficit’ I will remind him--and I will follow him around Toowoomba--and the people of Toowoomba of what he said in 2004 chapter and verse! I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011495"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011496"></A>
I now direct my remarks to the Budget’s impact on my own electorate. Although we do live in challenging economic times, I’m very happy that the State Government in this budget has delivered on many of the items for which I strongly lobbied, like the funding for the CareFlight helicopter service, significant monies to help the Toowoomba Regional Council in building our airport and more money for road works.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011497"></A>
As well, it is pleasing to see funds being allocated to complete the National Carriage Factory and funds for the auditorium at Highfields State School, the Criterium Cycling track and the new fire station at Kitchener Street, as well as the fulfilment of the one outstanding election promise, namely the building of a kindergarten at Fairview Heights State School. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011498"></A>
I am particularly pleased to see the funding of so many units of housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1011582"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr GIBSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gympie--LNP) (11.28 am): It is a pleasure to be on my feet this morning. Nearly 12 months ago we were in this place until 4 am Saturday morning as this Labor government, without a mandate of the people of Queensland, pushed through legislation that resulted in the increase in the price of fuel and delivered legislation to sell off profitable state owned assets. Any government that wishes to sell off public assets should do so with a mandate from the people who own those assets, not dishonestly like some thief as we saw from this Labor government. As a result, we see a Premier at a new low in the popularity stakes and polls showing 85 per cent of Queenslanders opposed to Labor’s asset sell-offs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011583"></A>
But Labor still ignores the people of Queensland. Despite much happening over those 12 months since the last budget, today we find ourselves looking at a typical old-fashioned, tax-and-spend Labor budget with all the debt and deficit that we have come to expect from Labor. In this budget in reply speech, I wish to address three main areas: firstly, overall budget observations from the perspective of my electorate of Gympie; secondly, some brief remarks on my portfolio responsibilities as the shadow minister for infrastructure and planning as I intend to pursue the portfolio matters in more detail during the estimates process; thirdly, I will also be outlining the budget alternative from the LNP perspective and then, finally, I will give a recognition of funding requirements for children suffering from hearing loss. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011584"></A>
The observations of the 2010-11 Labor state budget shows that it is a budget that fails to deliver on job, chalks up record debt and delivers four years of budget deficits. But that is what we have come to expect from Labor. After 12 years of Labor mismanagement, the days of Queensland being the low-tax, lifestyle capital of Australia are gone. This budget sets out in tragic detail Queensland’s economic decline under a Labor administration. Where Queensland was once the economic powerhouse, after 12 years of Labor the Sunshine State is being eclipsed by a budget black hole of $51 billion this year, rising to $83.5 billion in 2014-15. We have nothing to show for a decade of boom other than a looming decade of debt and deficits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011585"></A>
Queenslanders are rightfully asking: how can this government be trusted to steer us through when it could not manage things in the good times? Yesterday in this House we saw an attack by the Premier on me for daring to invite the people of Gympie to be involved in any analysis of the budget papers. I should not be surprised by that, because Labor does not like to listen to Queenslanders. Labor does not like to listen to the people and their ideas and views. It refuses to listen to their views on the asset sell-off. This is a Premier who still refuses to visit the people of the Mary Valley and who sends a minister to a public meeting but who forgets to invite the public. The very thought of engaging with the community must send shivers down the spine of this Premier and her ministers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011586"></A>
At this point, I would like to thank the members of the Gympie community who, in response to that media article, showed that they were interested in reviewing the budget papers. These people were local teachers, nurses, public servants, university students, small-business people and retirees who gave of their time to look at the Queensland budget papers. My community is actively involved in the political processes. The experience of the Traveston Crossing Dam has shown them that they cannot trust a Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011588"></A>
As is often the case, we have seen in the 2010-11 state budget papers a change in the reporting style, which makes it more difficult to compare apples with apples than it was with previous state budgets. Despite that, there are concerns within these budget papers. The pressure on family budgets will continue to occur in the Gympie region, because this budget does very little to assist. We see increases in taxes and charges and we will see a flow-on effect from the introduction of a waste tax. We have also seen an increase in a tax that will impact on people in regional and rural areas and that is an increase in weapon licensing fees of 124 per cent for both licence renewals and applications. It is of concern to me also that the minister in his media statement states that each new applicant for a licence will be subsequently interviewed in person by police. Whilst this may simply be another way of saying that the application may be made in person, as is the case now, it may also be that a police officer will be required to take a person’s application in the future rather than the administration staff at the police station, as is the case now. If accurate, that will see fewer police on the beat, as they will be diverted from operational duties to administrative duties interviewing law-abiding citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011589"></A>
But we should not be surprised that this government introduces areas of waste. In my electorate we have seen a waste of $265 million in a failed project that should never have been put forward--the Traveston Crossing Dam. If this government had bothered to listen to academics, if it had bothered to listen to experts in the field, it would have realised the folly of putting forward a proposed dam on the Mary River. But what we saw from this government was, as a result of inaction in delivering infrastructure for so many years, panic policy--policy on the run--and that resulted in a waste of $265 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011590"></A>
I cannot help asking what would that $265 million deliver in my electorate if it were spent properly? It could have given us a new special school for the Gympie Special School students--a school that is desperately needed. That school is suffering from poor location and higher-need students being educated there. It desperately needs a new location. It could have provided for a new helipad for the Gympie Hospital, as we now find that the helipad at the Gympie Hospital is unable to be used. Owing to upgrades in avionic technology in helicopters, helicopters are now required to land at Archery Park, cross the Bruce Highway and then travel a distance to the Gympie Hospital. As we know, in emergencies every second is vital. The helipad should be located at the hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011593"></A>
That $265 million could also have gone towards the provision of additional services in the Gympie area--a new youth centre that is necessary, or even just the basics of better maintenance for schools. Within these budget papers there is a drop in funding to the State Schools of Tomorrow program, which contributed a significant portion of the maintenance funding in the last two state budgets. There is very little funding to maintain the BER school capital works since maintenance budgets are falling. With many of the schools in my electorate being of a significant age, we need to see funding for maintenance budgets grow, not reduce. There is, of course, the relocation of the Federal State School to a new location on Middle Creek Road. That funding is welcomed and is as a result of a realignment of the Bruce Highway under Commonwealth funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011597"></A>
I now wish to make a few brief comments about the Department of Infrastructure and Planning elements of this budget. The government is opting to proceed with infrastructure spending of $17.1 billion in this coming financial year. That expenditure will be mainly on roads and hospitals. It is recognised that this expenditure per capita is the biggest capital expenditure of any state. It sounds impressive but, when put in context of the neglect in infrastructure spending over the past decade of this Labor government, it is merely catch-up done in a hurry. What has wreaked greater financial havoc in Queensland than in other states was not the global financial crisis but rather years of loose fiscal policy by Labor governments combined with vast borrowings for essential infrastructure in a catch-up that is now plunging the state into deep red. What we are seeing here is, as a result of neglect of this Labor government over 12 years, the need to invest in infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011598"></A>
There was a time in this state when infrastructure was delivered not only on time and on budget but also was delivered with capacity for the future. We are now seeing from this government a delivery of infrastructure that will at best--at best--bring us up to what our needs are now, not deliver for what our needs are in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011629"></A>
It is as a result of better economic conditions that we now see the government halving its forecasted deficit, not through better economic management. With interest payments set to cost the state $827 million this financial year, $1.2 billion next financial year and $2.3 billion in 2013-14, one cannot help but ask the question ‘what could we have saved if we had delivered that infrastructure in the boom times, not playing catch up in the difficult times?’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011630"></A>
We have heard much from those opposite in criticism of the LNP alternatives to this budget, but let me state that I believe it should be any government’s priority to reclaim its AAA credit rating. The No. 1 priority for this LNP opposition is to see Queensland regain its AAA credit rating. Labor’s mismanagement of the economy, its refusal to listen to the warnings from financial markets and its failure to put in place a debt repayment strategy has seen Queensland stripped of its valued AAA credit rating. As I have indicated, this decision alone is costing taxpayers in extra interest repayments. Amongst the 40 pages of goals for cabinet ministers I am horrified that not one goal lists reclaiming our AAA credit rating as a priority. The LNP is also committed to halting privatisation and stopping the fire sale of Queensland Rail, our ports and our motorways. At this time Queensland needs the income from these assets to help pay off debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011631"></A>
The LNP is also committed to making it easier in household budgets. That will be through lower costs for motorists by, in our first term in office, a freeze on registration fees for cars and light vehicles along with recreational boats, trailers and horse floats. We are also committed to providing electricity relief for seniors. One of the greatest cons that we have seen was when this government purported that we would see a reduction in electricity prices as a result of its privatisation of the arms of Ergon and Energex. Since then, of course, as every Queenslander can tell us, electricity bills have soared by 54 per cent. To help lower the cost of living the LNP will increase the electricity rebate by 30 per cent for seniors and concession card holders. This rebate will take it from $190 per year to $247. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011632"></A>
There are other elements within the LNP’s commitment. One that is important is the protection of prime agricultural land. The state opposition has a plan to protect prime agricultural land for sustainable food and fibre production, not just for now but for generations to come. This is critically important as food security now moves to becoming one of the most important issues that we will face as a state and that we are facing globally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011633"></A>
It is now appropriate for me to turn my remarks to the funding provided in the budget for Queensland children suffering from hearing loss. As many in this chamber would be aware, as a child of deaf parents I am intimately aware of the challenges deaf people face. Any funding that is provided for early detection and intervention of hearing loss for infants and children is welcome as it is an important step towards giving our kids the best start in life. As elected representatives, however, we must remember that deafness is more than just a medical condition that requires a techno-fix. It is recognised that cochlear implants are an important advancement in assisting deaf people to be able to communicate in a hearing dominated world, but we must also accept that individuals who are deaf do not simply have damaged ears. Any government that does not accept this will be implementing a flawed policy direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011634"></A>
Deaf people belong to a community, a culture. In this sense deafness is unique amongst disability types. A sense of culture is strongest amongst those for whom sign language is their primary language, but it extends to all who use sign language regardless of their level of proficiency. It is this linguistic bond perhaps more than any other factor that binds the deaf community together. In many ways the social character of the deaf culture can be compared to that of any immigrant culture. Just as there is a strong sense of pride amongst the Sudanese or the Greek in their heritage and their societies there is a strong sense of pride amongst the deaf and they enjoy the status of a cultural and linguistic minority. Deafness is much more than just a physiological disability; it is a way of life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011635"></A>
It was therefore extremely unfortunate that in accepting the Queenslander of the Year award last week, Dimity Dornan from the Hear and Say Centre said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011636"></A>
I stand here to represent all the children who are deaf and all who haven’t been born yet who are deaf.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Deaf is not deaf anymore. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011639"></A>
I would hope that these remarks were not scripted but rather spoken in the exuberance of the moment and are now regretted, for they have caused concern amongst the deaf community throughout Australia. The funding provided by this Labor government for the Hear and Say Centre is significant, but we must recognise that the auditory verbal approach is only suitable for some deaf children. This government must show respect for the broader deaf community and recognise the worth and benefits of sign language as a valid communication choice for parents of deaf children. It is unfortunate that the media statements from the Bligh Labor government on this budget announcement do not reflect that respect to the deaf community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011640"></A>
The inference in media statements that future funding would be cut by a Labor government from Education Queensland programs for hearing impaired students as a result of this budget funding announcement is of deep concern. Further, the media statements imply that the only way deaf children are able to communicate is with a cochlear implant. This is simply not true and does not recognise the value of sign language known as Auslan. Auslan is an integral part of the richness of culture that is valued in the deaf community. No government should support the view that the deaf should be forced to assimilate into the dominant culture of spoken English. But from the wording of the media statements it appears that this is Labor’s position. We must recognise that a combination of communication strategies and options need to be funded and offered to all deaf children and their parents if we are to be serious about providing the strongest foundation for deaf children to have the best start in life. </Hansard-Body>

(11.46 am): I rise to join the cognate debate on the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill, the Appropriation Bill and the Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill which outlines the government’s budget for the next 12 months. This is a budget which does not really address the needs of all the people throughout Queensland, as the vast majority of the budgetary dollar remains in the south-east corner. It could be said that the south-east corner, which equates to around 10 per cent of the state, gets 90 per cent of the funds and that 90 per cent of the north and west, which provides the wealth of the state, supplies the food for the state and supports the tourist--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. The statement made by the honourable member is made with the full intention of misleading this parliament. It is incorrect. It is provably incorrect and she knows that to be the case. She is wilfully misleading this House. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If the minister had actually listened to what I said, I said ‘it could be said’. I had not quite finished my statement. It is often said. Perhaps the minister should just listen a little more before he opens his mouth. For many people in the state it could be considered that the majority of the state is really getting scattered crumbs from the government’s table.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011646"></A>
There are many issues that I will outline during the next 20 minutes but first of all I would like to bring to the attention of the House some issues that have been brought to me by some of the councils. An ongoing issue that has faced councils since amalgamation is that many remain out of pocket. The dollars that were expected to come did not. Costs that were supposed to be minimised were in fact increased due to the amalgamated council being lifted into a different bracket. They are finding that many of the costs that they did not expect to have to pay they now do. They are, in fact, still having trouble balancing their books.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011682"></A>
One of the other issues was the abolition of the state road and drainage grant last year. That has had a significant impact on the budgeted works for the roads and drainage in the rural areas of my electorate. It is something that I believe all councils would agree on. It would be helpful if consideration was given to reinstating the road and drainage grant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011686"></A>
I want to thank the Minister for Main Roads with regard to the Hampton Road situation. I know that the minister looked at it. He had a very difficult situation on his hands. I believe that was a win-win for everybody. Those who wanted to save all the trees had some of the trees saved and those who wanted the road upgraded got that, too. I congratulate the minister on that. That was a difficult one to negotiate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011687"></A>
I would now like to turn to some other issues. Since I was first elected in 1998, during every budget debate I have stood and asked that consideration be given to a new police station in Kingaroy. It is still an issue. All the painting and internal refurbishment does not resolve the problem that Kingaroy is growing at a considerable rate. More and more police are being crammed into what was always referred to as ‘the dump of the month’, and it still has that title to a degree. It is a sardine tin. There would not be a single person who works there who would not describe it as such. The officers are jammed in and it is very cramped. Again, I will put on the record that it needs to be considered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011688"></A>
The Kingaroy Courthouse also needs an upgrade, which has often been asked about. I know that the Minister for Police is very aware of the problems with both the Kingaroy Police Station and the courthouse. Each year we hope that something will come in the budget. Although we recognise that things are tight at the moment, things like the courthouse and the police station in Kingaroy, which have been on the table for a long time, really should be starting to move to the top of the pile. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011691"></A>
One of the main issues that everybody will talk about in this budget is health, of course. I will first touch on dental health in the South Burnett. We have always had an issue with dental health services at the hospital in Kingaroy. It is very difficult to get dentists out there; we all accept that. However, issues arise that people who are in a lot of pain cannot really comprehend. One of those issues was brought to me just this morning with regard to a woman who wanted dental treatment. She rang the hospital and was told she was 142nd on the list. A couple of days later she was 152nd on the list. Finally they did admit her as an emergency patient at the hospital, for which I am very grateful. I know that they work hard in difficult conditions. She needed three teeth removed. There was nothing that could be done with them; they needed removing. One was taken out and she was told by the dentist, ‘I would like to take the others out but I am not allowed to.’ Those were the words that were quoted to me. I would like to ask the Minister for Health why it is that this patient was told--and I presume other patients have been told--that the dentist could take only one tooth out. The person’s jaw is anaesthetised. Why not take out the other two that need to come out under the one anaesthetic? Why send them away and tell them to get back on the list to come back again? To me, it seems a waste of resources and time to be doing that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011692"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Ms Grace:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Did she ask? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011693"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, she did ask. She asked why and they said, ‘Because we have been told we are not allowed.’ That is what she was told. That is why I am asking. Who gave any directive that a dentist can take out only one tooth at a time? It may or may not be true, but I want to get to the facts of the case. It is not the first time it has been reported to me and I dare say it will not be the last. I would like to know who gave a directive that any person who goes to the clinic cannot have more than one tooth removed if it is required? I believe that the health system may indeed save extra dollars if those procedures could be done under one anaesthetic instead of two. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011694"></A>
Earlier I forgot to mention the overtaking lanes, the bridges and other infrastructure in my electorate that have been listed in the RIP on several occasions and have subsequently disappeared. There is a bridge being constructed at the southern entrance to Nanango. I believe the pylons et cetera have been lying there for over 18 months and nothing seems to be eventuating. Again, I know it is all blamed on the financial crisis, but things just keep deteriorating in rural and regional Queensland and the promises to fix them seem to be longer and longer in coming. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011696"></A>
Another issue is the hospital at Kingaroy, which is in need of replacement. I understand that a new lift is going in after that horrendous event that occurred not too long ago--two incidents with the lift. It is lucky that nobody was actually killed. That particular issue is being addressed, and I appreciate that. However, that does not take away from the fact that it is a very old hospital. It has had so many bandaids and patches put on it over the years and a little facelift, but they are all temporary things. They need addressing appropriately, and a new hospital is required for the South Burnett. The model I and most people in my electorate would prefer is a private-public hospital. But in all honesty we would just like to get a new hospital with very good facilities. We would like more modern facilities. We would like to see a hospital that would attract doctors rather than discourage them. It would attract all the services and encourage people with those skills to stay in the area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011699"></A>
Another major issue remains with the PTS, and I have to commend the staff at the Kingaroy Hospital. They have worked very hard trying to rectify the PTS problems that have arisen. I have nothing but praise for them. They have worked very hard. However, there are still issues. The reason the issues exist is understaffing. So consideration for at least one more full-time staff member to work with the PTS area of the hospital would be appreciated. I believe that the aim of any minister is to have a very smooth running system, and perhaps that is one area that can be looked at. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011701"></A>
One of the major issues I hear about from constituents is asset sales. Other members have stated that the asset sales are an ongoing concern in their electorates and it is so in mine. It still frustrates people that many economists have said that it is not necessary to sell off the assets. Queensland is in a state, we are told, that it has reduced the black hole by almost 50 per cent. So if we have reduced the black hole that was caused by the global financial crisis so quickly, why do we need to sell those assets? Eighteen letters have been forwarded to me just today. Admittedly, they are form letters. They are from people in my electorate. I do not know how many letters other members have received. I am going to read one of them out. It states--</Hansard-Body>

Dear Ms Bligh, </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011704"></A>
It is 12 months since the asset sales plans were announced and the evidence continues to mount that the State Government does not need to sell-off profitable, state-owned assets.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011705"></A>
Queensland’s economy is performing well with the recent federal budget indicating higher than expected growth in the coming 12 months--particularly for resource-rich states like Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011706"></A>
Already the state’s economy is projected to recover $11 billion of the $15 billion lost during the GFS--there is no longer any need to sell any of Queensland’s assets including essential roads. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011707"></A>
Premier, we want to keep our profitable Queensland assets in public hands. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011708"></A>
Today is an unhappy anniversary for Queenslanders. It is time to think twice about privatisation. No government has the right to sell our public assets. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011737"></A>
I know that rural Queenslanders feel very strongly about that issue. Figures have been bandied about. It is said that around 85 per cent of Queenslanders feel this way and in my electorate I think it is even higher. One of the things that really hurts rural and regional Queenslanders is that, while they do contribute significantly to the wealth of this state, I do not think one rural or regional Queenslander believes that rural and regional Queensland gets any value for the dollar they put in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011740"></A>
I will return quickly to the nurses’ pay debacle. I would like to mention one case. If I had had the opportunity I would have mentioned it earlier this week, but I will raise it now as it is a long time until we come back to this place. A constituent came to me because her pay had not turned up, as has happened to a lot of people. It is becoming quite a norm for many nurses. With our help, thankfully the minister resolved the problem--or so we thought. Eventually she received her money, but she was $900 short. When she took it up with payroll, they said, ‘No, Queensland Health does not owe you any money at all; it does not owe you that $900.’ The nurse was very particular, she kept all her pay slips and her work schedules, et cetera. She came in with all the documentation. She took it to the minister and, again, he fixed it up and the nurse received her $900. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011742"></A>
However, the question that concerns me is how many people would not push the issue and would miss out on the bit of pay that they are owed? How many people have incurred charges? This does not only relate to issues with banks and meeting loan repayments or whatever. For example, what happens if someone has brought a fridge from a local store? There are number of examples where people may not be able to meet a payment. I cannot see this government saying, ‘That’s all right, we’ll fork out that little bit of extra for the interest you have incurred. We’ll go in there with a rubber and tell them to take that black mark off your name.’ A lot of people are concerned about that issue. They live week to week and they are hurting badly. It surprises me that there was not a parallel system running or one that the payroll could quickly be switched over to. Most industries have that security if they move from one system to another. That was a major surprise to me. </Hansard-Body>

Recently the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 did something that was quite unnecessary, which was to provide a reminder to everybody of how much this government has cost or will cost each household in the next 12 months. The paper bandied the figure around of an extra $1,200 just to make ends meet, because of the rising costs in utilities such as water and sewage. Most members will know that we are paying exorbitant prices for electricity at the moment. In my area I know elderly couples who go to bed just on dark, because they do not want to use too much electricity. It worries me that the people who can least afford it are the ones who will pay huge prices as all of the utilities get dearer and dearer. In the past 12 months we have seen rising rates due partly, I guess, to amalgamation. We have had rising registration costs. Everyone is paying more for fuel. I could name an awful lot of other things as well. For any reader of the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 it was a timely reminder of just how much government costs are rising. However, I do not think many people need reminding because they live with it everyday and each day they find it a little harder to make the ends meet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011744"></A>
The government’s hands in people’s pockets is akin to desperate geese trying to get out the few last grains from the bottom of a jar, even though they are getting quite hurt. In this case, while it is the government taking from the people, it is the people in the low socioeconomic brackets who will be pushed to the wall. They will be unable to meet their rental and other commitments and will perhaps find themselves one of the growing number of people living in the streets. Affordable housing is needed. I heard at least one other member in the House saying they did not want affordable housing in their area. This winter I am sure there are many people who are living in the streets now or who may be facing that possibility who would be very grateful for affordable housing, and if not that they would be very grateful for a caravan or cabin, just to get out of the cold. If there is any affordable housing on offer, our electorate will be quite happy to have it. </Hansard-Body>

The global financial crisis has been devastating for many countries and economies. It came at a time when every government could throw the blame for its management at the feet of the GFC, when the truth is that it should possibly be thrown at the feet of government. Regardless of the laying of blame, however, people are suffering. Infrastructure in rural and regional Queensland has been left to disintegrate. Roads, bridges and other infrastructure that had been earmarked to be replaced are being maintained and possibly deteriorating even further. Councils are being asked to pick up more and more costs that were once the responsibility of government. You can dress it up any way you like, you can argue, you can divert the conversation, you can change the subject, you can protest, you can yell and try to howl someone down, but the simple truth is that under this Labor government Queensland is devolving. Rural and regional centres are going backwards and are unravelling at the seams. It is not something that the government should be proud of. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP) (12.06 pm): This budget continues to burden the state with a record $84 billion debt; it is a budget that makes no mention of debt repayment policy and fast-tracks the selloff of our state’s assets; it is a budget where all Queenslanders are faced with ever-increasing living expenses. Once again, the primary industries production sector has missed out on any significant funding. This was an opportunity lost by the Treasurer to recognise the great contribution that the rural and regional communities of Queensland make to the state’s economy. We have often heard it stated that Australia did not go into recession recently because of agriculture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011755"></A>
The allocation of $1.5 million over three years for the establishment of the new Queensland Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases is welcomed. However, this comes after the closure of the federally funded Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre in Brisbane, which was announced for the end of June this year. The work done at that centre in recent times has been vital, in particular the research into the deadly Hendra virus and a vaccination for horses. $1.5 million is not enough. What price can you place on the protection of our primary production from invasive pests and diseases that have the potential to bring the industry to a standstill or, even worse, cause the death of more human beings? Disappointingly, much of this money has been earmarked for bat ecology research, even though many of our veterinarians are unwilling to attend equine problems for fear of contracting the deadly Hendra virus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011787"></A>
The $300,000 to fund research into Hendra virus vaccination is also welcome, but it is only a drop in the ocean. Testing needs to be carried out to progress this vaccination as rapidly as possible before more human loss of life and horse deaths occur. Further funding will be needed to make this research possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011791"></A>
On a number of occasions I have met with various vets who spoke of this vaccination. Once this vaccination does get out there, all horse owners will take it up--they would be fools not to. The beauty of this research that is occurring at the moment is that, once a horse is vaccinated, the horse cannot then pass Hendra on to humans. We are not looking at just protecting horses. That is the beauty of this vaccination: the virus cannot be transferred to human beings once a horse has been vaccinated. So it is absolutely imperative that this vaccination be fast-tracked. These vets certainly know what they are talking about. The CSIRO is right on the edge of doing this. They needed $900,000. I note that the minister has announced funding in recent weeks, and we all appreciate that. But it must be followed up, as that vaccination must be made available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011795"></A>
The amount of $3 million has been allocated for the creation of a Darling Downs Cropping Research and Training Centre. I ask why, when a perfectly wonderful research and training facility at Dalby exists--the AACC Dalby campus? Instead of utilising the facilities at Dalby, which were purposely designed to provide training in broadscale crop production and research, this government is spending more money replicating facilities and selling off assets instead of maintaining and strengthening the assets that already exist. We have heard all the spin about the agricultural colleges. I attended those meetings where the director-general and the minister came out with their ‘deinvest to reinvest’ policy. Now the land will be sold off and we will never see that agricultural college campus in use again. I think that is an absolutely horrific crying shame that that sort of deal can go down. The agricultural college was not promoted very well in the last five years. Former minister Tom Barton amalgamated the colleges, and thus was their downfall when they sacked the local board and lost local input and then it did not attract students from then on. Instead of rebuilding and promoting those colleges, we have seen a massive sell-off, and that is totally unacceptable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011798"></A>
The investment of $17.5 million for beef research infrastructure is part of the fresh approach, as the minister calls it, to deinvest to reinvest. This strategy of the Labor government we watch with great interest and dismay, as DPI offices are closing; research, development and extension staff are being made redundant; and services to the public are being cut. Waste is everywhere. The so-called fresh approach is cutting the heart out of the rural sector, not saving it. Just recently I went to walk into the Oakey DPI office. There was a sign on the door ‘This office is closed’. I then rang the department and asked, ‘Is the Oakey office closed?’ They would not answer me. I asked, ‘What is the official statement?’ The official statement was, ‘No, the Oakey office is not closed. There are just no staff there.’ So what would you call that? Pittsworth was closed the same week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011799"></A>
We have a brilliant stock inspector out there. We have had a tick outbreak at Pittsworth just recently. We have had a number of tick outbreaks around the Haden and Crows Nest area. These services are being taken away from the bush and the protection mechanism is not being kept up. We simply shake our head. The DPI offices are either closed or open for only one day a week. Many border towns do not have stock inspectors or, as they are known, biosecurity officers. The drastic cuts in funding have affected the services of many areas within the department. This creates more problems for those living in rural and regional Queensland being able to access information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011802"></A>
Some of the police stations in my electorate have been closed or are manned for only one day a week--yet another example of services diminishing in rural and regional Queensland. Schools in small communities are under threat of closing. Many of these communities revolve around the local school activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011803"></A>
The Warrego Highway retains the title of the worst highway in Queensland. There is still no significant funding to address a major roadway that has an ever-increasing number of vehicles on it. We all know what is happening with the coal seam gas industry and the mining right through from Toowoomba to the west. They say that traffic on that highway will double in five years time. So emphasis must be put on the Warrego Highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011804"></A>
I note that in the budget $500,000 has been allocated for the road edges, but we need major funding. I have heard Minister Wallace talk about a total cost of $400 million. We need to seriously look at that. We have had freight taken off Queensland Rail and so we now have cattle coming from the west in semitrailers and we see coal in B-doubles going through James Street in Toowoomba. We have had grains on the Downs in storage for two years because we could not get our sorghum to port. All of that has to come down the road--the Warrego Highway. It is really the jugular vein of Queensland. We have to put emphasis on getting funding for that highway and the range crossing as well. There is still no significant funding to address this major roadway, and it has an ever-increasing number of vehicles travelling on it. As the resource boom continues--</Hansard-Body>

The budget puts bandaids on sections of our roadway system but is not addressing the real issue of solving the increased traffic burden on the Warrego Highway and reducing the risk for those travelling on this highway. We have had two serious accidents in front of the Charlton school where they have to turn off the highway to drop their children to school and pick their children up from school. It is only a matter of time before there is another serious accident. We have to seriously consider that. There is an intersection just past the Dalby high school that needs a bypass lane at the railway crossing. Barnaby Joyce was in Dalby recently because people could not cross the road without falling over because of the potholes. About two weeks later we managed to get that road resurfaced. The massive amount of traffic on the Warrego Highway is absolutely incredible and it needs to be No. 1 on the list. </Hansard-Body>

Significant funding needs to be allocated for research into the impacts on the Great Artesian Basin and our underground water supplies by the rapid expansion of the coal seam gas industry. Scientific studies and research need to be done into the long-term effects on the underground water, which many rural and regional communities rely upon. This budget has not provided this important research opportunity. We do not know what impact the extraction of water with coal seam gas will have. There must be research done. The Western Downs shire has 23 towns and 22 of those towns rely on bore water. If there is interconnection between the aquifers, how do we know that we are not going to lose those aquifers and that water supply? We may not lose that water supply straightaway. I would hate to think that in 20 or 30 years time we will run out of water because we have not done the research to find out the extent of the problems that this could cause. In this budget no money has been put into research, and that is very, very disappointing. The Great Artesian Basin, as we all know, could be under threat from this. So we need to seriously look at this and do some research. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1011819"></A>
I would like to remind the people of Queensland that the rural and regional communities are extremely important to our economy. While infrastructure and services are being eroded in the bush, funding is increasing in the south-east corner. The natural resources of rural and regional communities are of great significance and should be appreciated for a long, long time. </Hansard-Body>

It is going to be very hard for this government to do much at all with an $84 billion debt. That equates to $14.9 million in interest being paid every day that we wake up. A brand-new high school could be built every day if we did not have to pay that interest. Think of what we could do to the health system if we did not have to pay that interest. So we have a serious cloud hanging over Queensland with this massive debt load that we carry.</Hansard-Body>

The DPI has been terribly eroded. How many scientists do we have working for the DPI now compared to 10 years ago? How many stock inspectors do we have compared to 10 years ago? We see men and women with knowledge being stood down. They are made to sign a confidentiality clause, take a payout and go. The DPI was once a service provider. It is not anymore and we are extremely concerned about this. We certainly need much more funding. We need to strengthen our DPI instead of closing its offices. We need to build up the morale in the staff, and we need to make it the wonderful department it once was. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (12.20 pm): I rise to support the 2010-11 state budget handed down on Tuesday by the Treasurer, Andrew Fraser. This was his third budget as Treasurer. I congratulate the Treasurer for a responsible budget that builds on our foundations for future economic recovery. We are protecting jobs by investing in the nation’s biggest infrastructure program, worth $17.1 billion. The Bligh government is delivering more jobs, higher growth, lower deficits and lower debt as we chart the course back to AAA.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018684"></A>
In contrast, yesterday’s budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition was a magic souffle, devoid of policy and investment strategies. It was contradictory, ill-conceived ramblings of an opposition searching for meaning and purpose. Those opposite claim their No. 1 priority is to return Queensland to a AAA credit rating, but, unsurprisingly, they have no ideas on how they will achieve this. With their commitment to not sell assets, the only conceivable way they can achieve this is by drastically increasing taxes or slashing funding to front-line services and jobs. At least Tony Abbott had the guts to admit what he would cut. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018685"></A>
The reply was also conspicuously absent of any mention of the LNP’s three per cent efficiency dividend policy, which leads us to believe that it still plans to cut 12,000 public sector jobs. The opposition presented a budget reply that did not mention a single monetary figure of how it would invest in Queensland’s future. In fact, the only figure mentioned in the reply was incorrect. The Leader of the Opposition claimed there are only 716 people employed by agriculture, food and regional services when there are 3,018 hardworking people currently employed by agriculture, food and regional services. If this does not foreshadow cutbacks under an LNP government, I am not sure what does. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018686"></A>
In response to the LNP’s prime agricultural land concept, I fail to see what it offers that the Bligh government is not already delivering. I will take it as imitation, which is the most sincere form of flattery. The opposition has used the term ‘category 1’ agricultural land, meaning that mining, housing and forestry applications would not be considered. The Bligh government has recognised that the best cropping land is a finite resource that must be conserved and managed for the longer term. The Bligh government’s proposed new framework ensures that mining, urban or other development that permanently alienates the land or reduces its productivity cannot occur unless it is overwhelmingly in the public interest. The only difference with the LNP’s option is that ‘category 1’ land will be off limits to all mining, and then in the next sentence the Leader of the Opposition contradicted himself saying it will be off limits to open-cut mining. This is ill-conceived ‘policy’ to say the least. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018687"></A>
Another element of the LNP’s proposal is the Commission for Future Foods and Fibre. Again, the opposition does not outline how it plans on funding this new commission, other than through its election commitment of a three per cent efficiency policy to cut Public Service jobs. It is also unclear what additional work this commission would do that government currently does not. DEEDI already has several units focused on food security and sustainability and is currently in the process of drafting a food policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018688"></A>
The LNP’s plan to reopen all the agricultural colleges is representative of how out of touch it is with industry needs. The restructuring of the Australian Agricultural College Corporation was in direct response to industry training needs. The old structure no longer delivered practical agricultural training for Queensland’s youth. The new structure, which industry has endorsed, will reinvigorate the agricultural training sector in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018690"></A>
On Tuesday the Treasurer presented a responsible budget that clearly outlines how the Bligh government will lead Queensland to economic recovery. The LNP’s response yesterday was a predictable shambles of random thoughts, with no vision or substance. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

As the Member for Mackay and the Minister for Rural and Regional Queensland I commend the Bligh Government’s commitment to investing in regional and rural economies, with more than 57% of this year’s building program being undertaken outside Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018693"></A>
This is reflected in an investment of more than $7,000 per person in capital expenditure in the Mackay region as opposed to around $3,000 per person in SEQ.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018694"></A>
In fact, spending per person in capital expenditure is higher in all regional areas across Queensland, when compared to the Southeast corner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018695"></A>
We are investing $1.35 billion in capital expenditure in the Mackay-Whitsunday region. This is 7.9% of the total state expenditure for about 4% of the State’s population.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018696"></A>
The Mackay region can be proud of the Bligh Government’s investment in building our region--including the $5 million allocated to revamp the Mackay Showgrounds. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018697"></A>
The Bligh Government has also recognised times are tough for families and delivered $500,000 for new services for children with autism in Mackay.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018698"></A>
As Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries, Rural and Regional Queensland the portfolio budget is $367.3 million for agriculture and food industries and regional economies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018699"></A>
With 1 in 8 jobs in Queensland supported by the agricultural supply chain, the Bligh Government has committed to building stronger agri-businesses and delivering more jobs for the sector--this budget delivers on this undertaking.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018700"></A>
We are building on a strong platform to drive economic growth in the agriculture and food industries to reach the future potential of $34 billion by 2020. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018701"></A>
We are also delivering on training for the future of the sector with reforms to the Australian Agricultural College Corporation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018702"></A>
Investment in Biosecurity is also an important part of this Budget. There is increased interest from the community on biosecurity issues, such as the impact of fire ants and Hendra virus. Funding for continued research and awareness campaigns are a vital part of the Budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018703"></A>
The Bligh Government has a strong economic strategy and we’re sticking to it. We’re responsible economic managers committed to strong fiscal principles. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018704"></A>
Through Australia’s biggest building program we are building tomorrow’s Queensland--protecting 106,000 local jobs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As Member for Mackay I would like to outline some of the expenditure in my local region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018706"></A>
I have already mentioned the $5 million allocated to re-invigorate the Mackay Showgrounds. This will give the region a modernised facility to attract high-quality events. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018707"></A>
Evidence of the Government’s plan to support Mackay’s economic growth and create jobs has been reiterated by funding of more than $47 million for local road safety projects.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018708"></A>
$4.86 million has been allocated this year for the construction of a deviation to a sealed standard on Rockleigh-North Mackay Road, between Sams Road and Barnes Creek Road, Mackay at a total cost of $20 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018709"></A>
There will also be $37.57 million for the construction of the Forgan River Bridge on Mackay-Slade Point Road at a total cost of $148 million, which includes an agreed developer contribution of $1.02 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018710"></A>
Further, we’ve committed $19.47 million to finish the improvements to rail infrastructure at Jilalan yard. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018711"></A>
Infrastructure means jobs, and more jobs means we’re a step closer to the state’s economic recovery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018712"></A>
$10 million has also been committed to continue the $27.7 million Mackay Trade Training Centre at the Central Queensland Institute of TAFE.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018713"></A>
The Bligh Government has also allocated $2 million to upgrade the region’s police and ambulance stations. $1 million will be provided this year to finish the total $4 million upgrade to Mackay’s Police Station, while $1 million will redevelop the ambulance station at South Mackay.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018714"></A>
$12 million would also be allocated as part of the $30 million upgrade of Kinchant Dam spillway. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018715"></A>
There has also been a clear focus on improving health facilities for the region including $75 million to go towards the $408.3 million redevelopment of the Mackay Base Hospital, which is on track to open in 2013. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018716"></A>
The redeveloped hospital will have nearly double the number of beds from 163 to 318, more operating theatres, a dedicated Coronary Care Unit and a larger Intensive Care Unit. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018717"></A>
It will also provide new emergency and outpatients’ departments, renal support services, day oncology and a dental services unit.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In addition to the $76.3 million allocated for Biosecurity Queensland in the State Budget 2010-11, the Bligh Government has allocated new funding of:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1018733"></A>
•	$1.5 million for the Queensland Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1018734"></A>
•	$300,000 for continued research into a Hendra virus vaccine.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018735"></A>
$1.5 million has been allocated over 3 years for the Queensland Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases. This centre will be located at the soon to be opened $100 million Health and Food Sciences Precinct at Coopers Plains, and positions Queensland as an international leader on Hendra virus research. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018736"></A>
With the closure of the Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre at the end of June, the Government has acted to ensure that the potentially-lifesaving research can continue.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018737"></A>
The new funding will allow this important work to be expanded, and Queensland will be positioned as a national and international leader in the field of emerging infectious diseases.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018738"></A>
The Bligh Government also committed $300,000, to be matched by the Australian Government to allow the Australian Animal Health Laboratory to test the effectiveness of newly developed Hendra virus vaccines in horses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1018741"></A>
•	$6.5 million to establish the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI) in partnership with the University of Queensland. This will strengthen food and fibre research and development. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1018742"></A>
•	$20 million reform of the Australian Agricultural College Corporation (AACC) to increase its delivery sites from five to 14 by 2012. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018743"></A>
This will strengthen the AACC’s position and provide education and skilling that industry needs for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018744"></A>
Through consultation, industry has told us we needed to change the way we delivered agricultural education and training. We responded with broader and more flexible training options for Queensland’s agricultural workforce.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018745"></A>
The $31.8 million increase over last year’s budget is largely the result of the integration of services for the food, wine and timber industries and regional services following the formation of the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation (DEEDI).</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018746"></A>
During the 2009-10 financial year the portfolio responsibilities were increased to include these areas promoting a more streamlined focus within DEEDI.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018747"></A>
With the portfolio responsibilities already including rural and regional Queensland, the addition of these areas provided synergy and enhanced service delivery in the regions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (12.25 pm): In March 2009 the Bligh government was elected to make the tough decisions. In the midst of the global economic crisis, with the state’s revenue base facing big hits from property market downturns, contraction of the mining industry and reduced GST returns, the Queensland people had a choice--the choice of a Bligh government prepared to make the tough decisions to keep the state’s massive building program going, to keep people in jobs and to set a bold job creation target, or an alternative government denying the depth of the economic crisis and promising job cuts to put 12,000 Queenslanders out of work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018755"></A>
Endorsement of the government’s commitment to make the tough decisions set Queensland on the path we are debating today with this appropriation, continuing our determination to build for Queensland’s future and to rebuild the economy following the downturn. It is true that some of the decisions this government has taken have not been popular. You cannot make the tough decisions and play the populist tune. To be popular, you throw money at every problem you confront without regard to future budgetary impacts. To be popular, you talk the talk but you do not walk the walk. To be popular, you promise things like a debt reduction strategy but you do not tell people what you would cut.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018756"></A>
I am proud to be a member of a government that makes the hard decisions, that focuses on horizons and not headlines, that prioritises development of a state asset base around essential infrastructure like hospitals, schools and roads and a human asset base of skilled nurses, doctors, police, teachers and teacher aides. I am proud to be a member of a Labor government that, when hit by the economic downturn, focused on keeping people in jobs. Faced with a need to reduce debt and chart a path back to the AAA credit rating and with the limited levers available in a state economy, I am proud that we chose to keep our infrastructure build and keep people in jobs. I am proud that we chose hospitals, schools and roads over growing woodchip. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018759"></A>
It is that focus on keeping Queenslanders in jobs that is delivering and driving the early signs of recovery we see today. As we debate the budget in the House, we do so following the release of employment figures that show 10 consecutive months of job growth, the creation of 8,800 jobs in Queensland last month, and an achievement of almost the halfway point of the bold jobs target. Without those jobs, without the massive building program, without making the tough decisions, we would not be seeing signs of recovery. There would be no housing recovery if the 120,000 people employed through the building program were out of work. There would be no recovery in consumer confidence and there would be no economic growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018761"></A>
Today, we debate a budget that returns the state to surplus earlier than forecast and charts a course of better than national average economic growth. I am pleased that the budget delivers outcomes for the people of Yeerongpilly and I thank the Treasurer for prising open the clasp of the public purse to provide the flow of funds to keep projects and programs. Improvements to local stations, facilities and maintenance at local schools, funding of kindergarten programs, the continued development of the sporting precinct in Yeronga and continued support for the upgrade of the Mains Road and Kessels Road intersection are all contained in this budget. At this point, I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1018763"></A>
The allocation of funds to build an access bridge from the Yeerongpilly station across Fairfield road will provide better access to the station, particularly for those without full mobility, as well as serve the State Tennis Centre and give connectivity to the people of Moorooka and Yeerongpilly to the tennis centre and the open space and walkways along the Brisbane River.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018764"></A>
There is a need to improve access to other local stations including Yeronga and Moorooka and I acknowledge the advocacy of local Yeronga Neighbourhood Watch members in particular regarding access to Yeronga station. I will continue to lobby for improvements to these stations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018765"></A>
What we see directly in this budget is a commitment to constructing shade structures on Yeronga and Moorooka stations. This will be of great benefit to commuters using these stations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018766"></A>
The new AFL headquarters in Yeronga continues the development of the Yeronga sporting precinct. The state contribution to the development builds on a government commitment to provide facilities and sporting opportunities to young Queenslanders. Not only will local kids aspire to play tennis on centre court at Tennyson, they will want to play real footy at Yeronga and go on to play with the Lions or Gold Coast AFL teams.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP) (12.28 pm): I want to congratulate the member for Yeerongpilly on a great speech. He has nailed it. I think this is a great budget in tough times. I want to congratulate the Treasurer for what he has been able to do this year in improving the fiscal position of Queensland. As the member for Yeerongpilly has pointed out, there are alternatives to the government strategy and how we are trying to address the global financial crisis. We have not heard any of them this week, but there are alternative strategies to selling assets and keeping people in employment by running a building program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018831"></A>
Increasing taxes and cutting spending is a legitimate policy response to the financial situation that we find ourselves in. If a political party were to put that proposition forward it would be a legitimate response to the situation that we find ourselves in. We are not quite sure whether that is what those on the other side are proposing because there is so much smoke and mirrors in their responses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018832"></A>
The reason we on this side of the House do not believe that that is the best strategy for addressing the global financial crisis is that it will mean that hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders will be put on the scrap heap of unemployment. There is nothing less undignified than being unemployed. There is nothing more important that we can do for people than keep them in work and put them into work. I am a strong believer in the dignity of work and governments having a role in ensuring that people obtain and remain in work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018833"></A>
I am from the left of the political spectrum. I am a collectivist and a progressive. I believe that government plays an important role in the economy. I believe in a mixed economy--that is, that the private sector has a role to play and the public sector has an important role to play as well. I am happy to stand here and support the sale of public assets. There are some things--</Hansard-Body>

Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Absolutely. There are some things that the government should be doing and does best and there are some things that the private sector should be doing and does best. I have many companies in my electorate that are in the forestry plantation business. Why is it fair, why is it right that the government should be in competition with those private providers? It should not be. Of course it should not be in the space which is logically the space of the private sector. How can those opposite who purport, at some point in their political history, to be the voice of the private sector not support the sale of assets like forestry plantations? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018836"></A>
Similarly, I do not believe that the public purse should be propping up trains that haul coal from the mines to a loader. I have a very large bauxite mine at Weipa in my electorate. Rio Tinto has very large trucks that pick up the dirt and drive it to the loader where it gets shipped. The logic of those opposite is that those trucks should be in state hands. What they are saying is that those trucks should be owned by the state of Queensland. That is the logic that they are applying--</Hansard-Body>

I will pick up on a couple of things that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned in his speech yesterday. How he could have the gross hypocrisy to mention wild rivers when that side of the House has twice come into this House and supported the wild rivers legislation and supported the framework that we have put in place to nominate wild rivers and say that they no longer support wild rivers is completely beyond me. They have had several occasions to oppose this legislation but they chose not to. In fact, they chose to support it. They are not being consistent. They are not being fair dinkum on this. The opportunity to exploit the bauxite resource around the springs in Cape York Peninsula in my electorate occurs once. The opportunity to exploit the environment for tourism, research and fishing is ongoing and sustainable. It is a good decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018842"></A>
Finally, I want to touch on protecting agricultural land. Again, I find the Leader of the Opposition’s remarks extraordinary. We have a plan in Far North Queensland. It is the FNQ 2031 plan. What it does is protect good quality agricultural land. That is basis of it. We were heavily criticised for putting that in place. </Hansard-Body>

 I will take that interjection. It has won an award. It protects good quality agricultural land. What did the then Leader of the Opposition and now Deputy Leader of the Opposition say in the context of the election campaign in March last year? He came into the Atherton Tablelands and said that he would rip it up. That is what he said those opposite would do to the FNQ 2031 plan. So we were out there protecting good quality agricultural land and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said he was going to rip up the plan.

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (12.35 pm): If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. These are comments by a noted American educationalist and certainly have not been taken into account in the framing of this budget. The total spend on education is miserly, to say the least. This year’s education budget has risen by only $260 million from the budget delivered 12 months ago. That is a mere 3.6 per cent increase. This is in the context of a total budget that has grown by 6.25 per cent. Education spending is clearly a low priority for this government and has certainly contracted as a proportion of the Queensland budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018882"></A>
A 4.5 per cent pay rise requires a $218 million a year increase on the department’s $4.8 million wages bill. An additional one per cent increase in staff just to match enrolment growth would cost another $50 million. Perhaps not coincidentally but this is almost exactly the $260 million increase from last year’s budget. This means that for the whole of education and training there is not one extra dollar this year above that budgeted for last year other than for these rises in wage costs. This can only mean that education in Queensland is going backwards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018883"></A>
It is frightening to think that with all the things happening in education, such as the national curriculum and the introduction of preprep, they are happening without any extra funding in the budget. Every aspect of education resourcing in this state will be more cash strapped this year than last. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018884"></A>
From the budget years 2000-01 to 2005-06 education comprised between 25 and 26 per cent of the total state budget. In the years 2006-07 to the current budget, 2010-11, it comprised between 22.9 per cent and 24.1 per cent. For the current year it has dropped to only 23.4 per cent of the total budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018885"></A>
Interestingly, the minister likes to say that education accounts for about a quarter of the budget. To be a quarter of the budget, education would need an additional $500 million. That would only bring it back to where funding was proportionately a decade ago. It is clear that funding and resources to education are being strangled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018886"></A>
It is interesting to see in these budget papers that the education departmental budget was underspent by $90 million. Spending on each child in prep and primary school rose by 2.3 per cent. But, because of the underspend in last year’s budget, the budget rise per child this year is less than one per cent. It gets worse if we look at secondary school students where we have seen a $400 per student cut from last year’s budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018887"></A>
For students with a disability, well there is a shame in this state. They can look forward to a cut of $140 per child with a disability on top of a $1,000 per child underspend from what was estimated in last year’s budget. How long can those opposite keep cutting from education in this way. It is a reflection of how ineffective this minister is that he has not been able to stand up for the resourcing of education for children in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018930"></A>
Let us have a look at some of the output measures revealed in this budget. They are the measures that tell us how we are going in education, what we are getting for these resources. Looking at output measures in the budget is the real shock in this shock and horror education budget. Meaningful measures of how education is going in Queensland will all but be eliminated from future budget papers. Details of the different stages of learning, including enrolment numbers, are gone. The year 2 diagnostic net, which I note the minister tried to have a go at me over this morning, is a discontinued measure. It is the major state based test for literacy and numeracy that last year revealed more than 50 per cent of Indigenous students needed reading support, as did a full quarter of all students. It has gone from future budget papers. The government’s response to the poor outcome has not been to fix the outcome; it has been to ensure that the outcomes are no longer published within the budget papers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018936"></A>
What is the reason given for no longer giving enrolment numbers for different stages of education, for removing data about children with disabilities, parental satisfaction rates at different levels of education, details of enrolment in the private sector and many, many more discontinued measures? If we do as the minister suggested this morning and go to book 5, it informs us of five pages of listed discontinued performance measures. Note 1 that is put in to explain it says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018938"></A>
Activity measures have been discontinued--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

all five pages of them--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

to accurately reflect the Government’s transition to service standards with greater focus on efficiency and effectiveness.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018941"></A>
Dear oh dear! This is just an extraordinary excuse for no longer giving a breakdown of enrolment figures and for no longer giving details, for example, of the number of people enrolled in TAFE--no surprise really given the crisis we have in TAFE.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018942"></A>
We should have a look at these discontinued measures in this budget as it is the last time they will be included in the budget papers. The year 2 diagnostic net test shows that almost 50 per cent of Indigenous students need intervention in relation to their reading. In fact, all measures for Indigenous students for literacy and numeracy fell way below targets for literacy and numeracy set in last year’s budget. No wonder the government does not want to produce these figures in future budgets! We see a further decline in the proportion of prep students who are attending state prep schools. The measure of parental and child satisfaction shows that in every measure in the middle phase of learning and in the senior phase of learning there has been a significant decline in both parental satisfaction and student satisfaction with the education they have received, and in every case the ranking of these most important of stakeholders--parents and students--has fallen a long way short of the targets set in last year’s budget. No wonder the government no longer wants to produce them!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018947"></A>
Another casualty will be the retention rate at year 12 for Indigenous students. This discontinued measure shows that in the last year the retention rate for Indigenous students at senior high school again declined from the previous year and fell miles short of the target set in last year’s budget. No wonder the government does not want to put it in future budgets! Particularly disappointing is that performance measures will be discontinued for students with disabilities. Looking at the figures that we see here for the last time, we can see why the government would not want us to know. We have four less special schools in the state than a year earlier despite the fact that there are more students enrolled in special schools. We have seen an increase in students--quite a big increase of about five per cent--in state schools who have been assessed as needing specialist support for a disability. Parental satisfaction with special schools is very high at 93 per cent. Parental satisfaction for parents of children with disabilities who are in state schools has plunged and is a long way short of the target set in last year’s budget of 84 per cent of satisfied parents. It came in at only 78.2 per cent--that is, these are parents of children with substantial disabilities. Another interesting figure in relation to this government’s support for children with disabilities is that the spend on each individual child with a disability declined in dollar terms from the previous year and fell an amazing $1,000 per child with a disability short of what was budgeted in last year’s budget estimates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018949"></A>
The commencement of 15- to 17-year-olds in apprenticeships and traineeships is truly alarming at just 14,700, almost 10 per cent short of the target set in last year’s budget and significantly less than the 19,000 to 20,000 in the budget two years ago in 2007-08. We are going backwards in the area of apprenticeships and training. The area of training has become one of the greatest casualties under this government. The overall number of students in VET missed the target set last year by 20,000 students and it has shown no increase from the previous year despite all the rhetoric and talk we have heard from this government and the Rudd government about training and skills shortages. Students in TAFE--that strife-ridden sector of the training industry--have dramatically declined, with a further 11,000 students less this year than last year and 22,000 students this year short of the target promised by this government in last year’s budget. The LNP believes that quality education is a core duty of state government and we have led the policy discussion in education.</Hansard-Body>

 Those opposite do not even bother to read it. Our response to the Masters report was released long before the government ever responded to the Masters report. A detailed response to the government’s Flying Start green paper was released for stakeholders to see promptly after the government dropped that paper as an exclusive to the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. Just this week I released our discussion paper supporting middle schooling as an option to simply moving year 7 from primary school to high school, with all the attendant problems of taking that step. We have even introduced Australia’s first specific anti-cyberbullying law and are currently battling to get government support to see its passage in this House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018956"></A>
The area of skills training in Queensland is a disaster and stands as a national disgrace, with the government’s only response appearing to be producing less information, charging students more in fees and cutting government support. Staff in the VET sector have been cut by 100 from last year and we have graduated only 11,500 apprentices state-wide. TAFE fees have skyrocketed by tens of millions of dollars. Southbank TAFE last year budgeted $41 million for user charges, actually collected $52 million and this year expects that to go up to $61 million in user charges--all this in a background of completely stagnant enrolments in training. In fact, the enrolment numbers are so embarrassing--you guessed it--the government does not particularly want you to see them in future budget papers. In the previous budget when the government did publish global figures for VET training we were 20,000 trainees short of target.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018959"></A>
As we move to the phased introduction of national curriculum from 2011 and the expected move of year 7 to high school in 2014, we have seen none of the planning and in particular none of the resources that are desperately needed for professional development and resourcing for such major undertakings in education. Let me place on record the fact that I think Queensland teachers do a fabulous job. They know what to teach and they teach it well. But when it comes to this sort of radical change, they are let down by the lack of planning and resources, as we have seen in discussions of the national curriculum this week. In fact, we see the government considering the closure of yet another 15 schools on top of the many dozens of schools it has closed over the last decade. No new schools are announced in this budget, just a small handful of reannounced schools, despite the fact that Queensland has again attracted 100,000 extra people over the past year. Many of our state schools are at or above capacity, particularly in growth areas like the Gold Coast, Fraser Coast, Brisbane and so on.</Hansard-Body>

I would like now to make some comments in relation to my own electorate of Moggill. The western suburbs of Brisbane highlight and are indicative of the failure of this government to respond adequately to the growth of South-East Queensland. By far and away the most pressing issue of widespread concern is that of grossly unacceptable traffic congestion and hopelessly inadequate public transport infrastructure. I am disappointed to again be standing here and saying that, for another year, the government has failed in its obligations to meet these essential transport services for a growing population. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022596"></A>
Every morning and afternoon Moggill Road grinds to a virtual halt. It is consistently one of the worst commutes in Brisbane. It has choke points at a number of almost insoluble locations, such as the Kenmore roundabout, the Moggill Road-Kenmore Road intersection and the stretch of Moggill Road through Chapel Hill where traffic merges from the Western Freeway. The government, despite having done a study in community consultation of the Kenmore bypass at my request, has failed to meet its own deadline to release its response to the recommended route--and I see that the minister is in the chamber with us today. That means that not only does the traffic continue to worsen in a manner that would not be acceptable in any constituency in Australia but also residents have to live with the complete uncertainty of whether a new road will be considered, when that new road might be considered or whether, in fact, they might even need to consider leaving their homes and leaving the area as they can no longer manage work and school in the traffic conditions. Hundreds of local residents have been forced to make the latter determination. </Hansard-Body>

A consequence of the completely inadequate roads is that there is virtually no public transport infrastructure. While the rest of Brisbane enjoys busways, bus priority lanes and the like, my area has not a single bus priority lane and certainly no major public transport infrastructure of the type that has been constructed elsewhere in Brisbane. You certainly cannot criticise residents for not utilising public transport when workable public transport is not made available to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022599"></A>
Although I see action from the Brisbane City Council on projects such as the Northern Link, the state government’s Western Freeway continues not just to be ignored but to not even have a forward plan as to what might be considered to fix it in the future. At this point, we can expect the Brisbane City Council to address the chronic problem at the Toowong roundabout only to find that the state government’s failure to resolve the future of the Western Freeway simply moves the traffic choke point to another place along that road. This situation is set to deteriorate over the next generation as the state government directs massive population growth into Brisbane’s western growth corridor. </Hansard-Body>

It is so disappointing to see weak Labor members representing seats such as Mount Ommaney and Ipswich West, whose constituents sit in these traffic jams on the Western Freeway and who from Ipswich West have to come over Colleges Crossing--that inadequate piece of road--and sit in the traffic queue on Moggill Road. We never hear anything from those members on behalf of their constituents. They certainly have exerted no influence over the appalling performance of this government as it continues to neglect the transport needs. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to the seat of Moggill, I am pleased to be able to stand here to give constituents a voice--constituents who have grown increasingly fed up with government inaction, with a government that does not understand that state government is about providing basic services such as transport, such as roads, such as schools and ensuring that those services are delivered. When I deliver this address next year I can only hope that we are seeing some action on some of these issues. Of course, the only other option for people who need an effective state government is to get a new state government. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundaberg--LNP) (12.55 pm): This state Labor Premier talks about how this state has created an environment of openness and transparency since the Fitzgerald inquiry. However, when we get past the spin we again witness this government say one thing and do another--a state Labor government that is willing to say and do anything to justify its actions without humility and without being able to accept that they just got it wrong. It has deceit, debt and no decency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022612"></A>
Confidence, not just in the marketplace but in families and in all other members of our community, is born out of openness and transparency. The Bligh government is more about control than it is about consultation and true openness. A 2010 review by one of the world’s largest banks into the Queensland economy was less than flattering. That report dealt with activity in the Queensland economy and the issue of the government’s economic performance. This review paints a grim picture of how, in just a few short years, Queensland’s once nation-leading financial performance has become the basket case of all the Australian states. The review highlighted how this state Labor government had driven a once very proud and sound financial state into massive operational deficits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022613"></A>
This 2010 review highlighted that, even with the billions from this Labor state government’s asset sales, it will not be enough to see Queensland’s credit rating return to AAA. The Queensland government’s liabilities, which were 20 per cent of the total budget in 2004-05, have now exploded to approximately 120 per cent of the annual budget and the predictions are that it will go even higher in the future. Until this deficit is brought under control, Queensland’s once proud AAA rating will not be restored, to the detriment of all Queenslanders. Every time a Queenslander switches on a light, turns on a tap, buys groceries or puts petrol in their vehicle, they will start paying for this state government’s mismanagement. Queenslanders will pay the price for almost 20 years of neglect, budget blow-outs and financial mismanagement. They will pay the price for this state government sending Queensland, as everyone knows, broke in a boom. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Projects across this great state are experiencing budget blow-outs and taxes are again starting to rise to record levels. I am very glad that the Minister for Main Roads mentioned the Bundaberg Ring Road, which is a magnificent road for the community of Bundaberg. We see a commitment of $42 million for the Bundaberg Ring Road, we see it completed on time--thanks to the hard work and dedication of the workers--but what do we see? A $100 million blown-out project--a project that initially was surveyed almost 20 years ago. But like the example of the ring-road, things have only become worse. After a decade of untold wealth, Queensland is now locked into debt. The state is heading towards an $83 billion debt and Queensland will be paying approximately $14 million each and every day to cover the interest bill owing to this state government’s incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022617"></A>
The members on the government side of the House like to show contempt for the people of Queensland and blame this state’s problems solely on the global financial crisis without taking any responsibility for the continual financial failings of Labor governments. The global financial crisis did not send Queensland broke, but it certainly gave the Labor Party a convenient excuse for our dire situation. The global financial crisis cannot be used as an excuse for the Labor government misleading the people of Queensland and not revealing the full extent of the Sunshine State’s financial problems before the last election. Even with all the flamboyant language of the Treasurer, the reality is that the truth cannot be hidden by words. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1022618"></A>
The government members would have Queensland believe that the sale of state assets and the current economic climate will save our state. That is simply not true and is equivalent to the government seeking to sell the family home to pay the bills. </Hansard-Body>

 This government has decided to sell Queensland’s future by putting money-raising assets up for sale. If these assets are such a burden for this great state then why can only private enterprise and not this government see the potential of these money-making assets and the streams of revenue that they will provide in the way of teachers, police and other healthcare workers? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029785"></A>
With the introduction of the Labor federal government’s super tax on the mining industry and the instability it has created, what confidence can large private enterprise have that the super tax will not eventually be implemented, maybe in another form, in their industries in the future? Industries and communities need confidence. How did our state’s robust economy, boosted by years of mining boom, GST and stamp duty, end up in such dire straits? Prior to his retirement, legendary Queensland Treasury Corporation head Sir Leo Hielscher revealed that the cost of the loss of the AAA credit rating is enough to pay for a new children’s hospital once a year instead of once in a lifetime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029786"></A>
I will now address the issues in relation to Child Safety Services. More than 60 per cent of children subjected to harm and abuse are aged five and over. Children aged 10 to 14 years of age are the most likely age group to suffer sexual abuse. Families at risk and children most vulnerable to abuse cover a whole range of age groups and localities across all of Queensland, from Bamaga to the border. While it is challenging to accurately measure the cost impact of prevention and early intervention, it is clear that prevention and early intervention are cost-effective over the long term. Preventing child maltreatment requires action at multiple levels across the continuum of the public health model. More broadly, it is important that we foster a society that is supportive of children and families. There is a growing body of evidence affirming the importance of social connectedness in creating child- and family-friendly communities and the impact that a community has on child development, parenting and welfare. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029787"></A>
Early intervention strategies to reduce the risks of harm and minimise the number of children being taken into care must be focused, responsive and backed up with action, not just spin and rhetoric. Under this Labor government the number of children in Queensland subject to ongoing intervention through Child Safety Services went from 8,263 in 2008 to 10,647. The number of children in out-of-home care has soared, from 5,657 in 2005 to 7,093 in 2009. In 2010-11 Child Safety is expected to receive 101,800 intakes of suspected abuse. This is a near 10 per cent increase on the previous year and this will places significant burden on child safety staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029788"></A>
All we hear from the government is how great its child safety budget is--$695,894,000--but that is not all we hear. This government just does not get it when it comes to child protection services, as explained by one long-serving and frustrated child safety worker when she stated, ‘They just can’t see the forest for the trees.’ For more than a decade now this Labor government has presided over the protection of children. What it has delivered is record numbers of children living in foster care, record numbers of children on protection orders, record numbers of children who are passing away who are known to Child Safety and record numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being removed from their families and taken into care. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In just four years from 2005 this figure doubled. Thirty-six per cent of all children in care are Indigenous. This is an outrageous figure when we take into account that ATSI children comprise 6.3 per cent of children from 0 to 17 years of age in Queensland yet we have the overrepresentation of 36 per cent of those children in care.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029795"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029797"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection. If the minister wants to go away from Child Safety, I am happy to step in and do his job. As we look at this budget we see a litany of failures from this Labor government to deliver valuable child safety infrastructure. This Labor government failed to deliver $4 million in vital residential care facilities to children in need of care. This government also failed to deliver more than $2 million in crucial therapeutic residential care facilities. So what does it do? It renounces it as some new commitment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029798"></A>
This government has failed horribly to deliver the valuable infrastructure that was needed in 2009-10 and budgeted for in that year, not the next financial year. But most damning was the government’s failure to once again deliver on time and on budget crucial infrastructure for Indigenous communities--a massive $3 million underspend, which has put children at further risk. I repeat those figures that I quoted earlier: six per cent of the community is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander yet there is an overrepresentation of over 36 per cent in Child Safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029799"></A>
The greatest tragedy in child safety in this astronomical budget is the waste. There is no greater indication of that waste than the money burn that is the ICMS computer system that has seen this financial budget jump from $20 million to $77 million, with a cost blowout in 2009-10 alone of some $28 million. This is a multimillion dollar system that still cannot deliver basic information on children in the system. Think of the millions, wasted on a computer system that was supposed to be completed in 2007, that could have been spent on meaningful early intervention strategies to reduce the number of children needing out-of-home care or front-line child safety staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032851"></A>
That brings me to the next point of this budget and that is the lack of investment in staff. We have been offered nothing more than bread crumbs and an unrealistic number, considering the high workload and demands--36 staff in one year to handle an explosion in child safety intakes, record numbers of children in out-of-home care, more children in need of protection than ever before and record numbers of Indigenous children being taken from families in remote communities. How will an extra 36 staff cover these growing issues when we already know that existing assessments of children at risk are not being done in mandatory time frames? We know that staff continue to leave the department at higher than average levels and case loads continue to remain unsustainable. We know that over 10,000 matters were not investigated in required time frames in 2009 and that there were 900 critical investigations where the risk to the child was extreme. These should have been undertaken within 24 hours but were not. How many of these children suffered further abuse while waiting to be seen? We have had record budget after record budget and still we see children suffering. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032852"></A>
Queensland children at risk of harm and abuse and those children in need of protection deserve more than a state Labor government that thinks that, by saying the government’s budget bottom line is going to solve all the problems, it will. We need a system of child safety that is responsive, open and able to meet the needs of children and their families, a system that does not ignore affected parents but is resilient enough to work with them to build positive, strong home environments in which a child can grow. We need and deserve a system where children in care can have stable, positive placements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032853"></A>
We do not need a system like the one that this state Labor government offers where 33 per cent of children who exit care have four or more placements. We are sending the wrong message as far as stability is concerned for a part of the community that is already suffering serious effects because of displacement. We need a system that does not waste millions of dollars appeasing government bean counters but fully utilises its valued workers and addresses the needs of those Child Safety staff and the children and families they do help. When we speak to them we find that a lot of them do it not for the money but because they are drawn towards the vocation to help the children of this state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032855"></A>
We need a system of child protection that recognises the value of our non-government service providers and the role they play in the child protection process that extends beyond foster care placements. Queensland deserves a child protection system that does not place abused children with providers who have not been properly licensed, which could see the child further harmed. All members of this House would agree that child sexual assault is a crime and should be properly investigated by police. Police and child safety workers working together to bring child sexual offenders to justice should be the goal, and I implore this government to increase interdepartmental cooperation to ensure investigations are not inhibited by confusion over who does what or who is not sharing information. I understand there is a bill before the House in relation to information sharing that I look forward to. I will not go further in relation to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032856"></A>
This budget does not even provide Queenslanders with a breakdown of the types of abuse that have been investigated or proven by the Child Safety Service. In fact, this Child Safety budget of $695 million provides approximately one page of performance data. When you go through all the previous budgets, this is a far cry from the 30-plus page budget books released for Child Safety only three years ago. This also goes nowhere towards enhancing the openness and transparency that is required to increase the public perception of the valuable work that Child Safety contributes to the Queensland community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032859"></A>
The budget is silent on the ongoing rollout of the much criticised One Chance at Childhood policy. Millions were set aside over four years, but the program was a resounding failure. We still have no idea how much money has been wasted. When it comes to reporting and openness, this government’s track record in the area of child safety has left much to be desired. Simple questions about issues facing children coming into care have gone unanswered, placing at risk the effective monitoring of the health and welfare of children in care. This budget has wiped from its books performance measure after performance measure and Child Safety has turned into a closed shop, hidden department tucked away in Communities. This government has become so arrogant in relation to the political process that it is as though the recommendations of the CMC inquiry, the Baby Kate inquiry, and the many other changes supposed to have been implemented never existed. We have returned to the dark old days when the now Premier presided over one of the most disturbing periods of child protection. Hiding Child Safety away in the pages of the Communities’ budget with no proper breakdown into how the child safety budget has been spent is a recipe for disaster that will only see more children harmed and a dark veil of secrecy cast across its operations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032860"></A>
As I stated at the beginning of this speech, confidence is borne out of openness and transparency and the Bligh Labor government is more about control than it is about true consultation. I only have a few seconds left, but I implore this government to fully support the hardworking members of Child Safety and go forward. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (2.45 pm): Just before the budget was brought down, an opinion poll appeared in the local press which highlighted the degree of distrust that the people of Queensland have in this Premier and her government. A 69 per cent disapproval rating is an overwhelming indictment, but it is more than that: it shows that Queenslanders do not believe a word that comes out of the collective mouth of this government. They are not listening to this government, they have lost faith in this government and they want this government gone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032864"></A>
Reading through the budget papers, particularly in my own portfolio area, this feeling of distrust continues to show through. The way the papers have been presented makes it exceptionally difficult to compare this government’s performance with what has happened over previous years. When the government goes to such great pains to lump figures together, you can be sure of one thing: it is covering up the truth of its inaction and its complete disregard for the environment of this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032865"></A>
I would like to highlight as evidence a statement attributed to the Treasurer in the Regional Budget Statement for 2010, which reads in part--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1032867"></A>
Through strong discipline we are seeing the deficit and debt lowered and we are on track to surplus. The economic reform agenda we put in place is working--and we need to stick to our plan in the face of global uncertainty ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1032868"></A>
However, the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 summary of the budget reads--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1032870"></A>
Deficit: $287 million 2009-10; $1.745 billion 2010-11; $1.442 billion in 2011-12; $1.482 billion in 2012-13; $1.395 billion in 2013-14 </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032871"></A>
I suppose we cannot deny that what the Treasurer claims is the truth. I suppose we cannot deny that we are on the way back to surplus, but when? As I look around at the members of this parliament, probably only the very young amongst us will be alive to see a surplus as proposed by the Treasurer’s words.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032872"></A>
I would now like to turn to the other big ‘D’ word which is debt. What is happening to the first elephant in the room while this Labor government procrastinates and dithers about getting its reckless spending under control? Again, the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1032874"></A>
Total Government Debt: $51.6 billion in 2009-10; $62.827 billion in 2010-11; $72.791 billion in 2011-12; $78.971 billion in 2012-1; $83.545 billion in 2013-14 </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032875"></A>
The Treasurer says, ‘We are seeing the deficit and debt lowered.’ However, when I look at those figures the graph is heading in exactly the opposite direction to what the Treasurer would have us believe. Even allowing for the mysteries of accrual accounting, I do not know of anyone other than the Treasurer who would describe that absolute debt and trend debt as ‘lowering’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032876"></A>
Off into the future, the deficit is starting to come down on these figures, but there is no such hope in the debt figures. How anyone can claim that a debt rising from $51.6 billion to about $83.5 billion on a continuous upward trend is a debt being ‘lowered’ is quite beyond me. This government seems to think that the Queensland electorate has ‘idiot’ tattooed on its collective forehead, which is precisely why they do not believe a word this Labor government says. It is just bare-faced ‘spin’, which has cost this Labor government the faith of the electors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032907"></A>
It is legitimate to ask--indeed, it would be a dereliction of duty not to ask--what is the extra strategy for paying off the state debt? What is this Labor government waiting for? When is it proposed to start? How many hospitals, how many schools, how many roads, how many ports, how many rail lines could have been built by the interest bill that every Queenslander--every man, woman and child--will now have to pay off? That is a $18,772 individual debt, compliments of this Labor government which has achieved the notoriety of going bust in a boom. There will be a day of reckoning, but the reckoning will be faced by a responsible government, certainly not this Labor government, and a very angry electorate that will have to tighten its collective belt to pay off Labor’s great big debt well into the future. But there is more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032908"></A>
There is a second elephant in the room. After all, what is a circus without elephants? The second elephant in the room is Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan’s mining super profits tax. The Treasurer says it is not legitimate to factor in the consequences of a tax that is yet to be fully developed and is not legislated for as yet. However, getting the federal budget into surplus, allegedly in three years and three years ahead of the date planned, is wholly predicated on the mining super profits tax as is. Federal Treasurer Swan clearly sees it as legitimate to include the targeted revenues. Does the member for Mount Coot-tha think that his federal Labor Treasurer is not telling the truth? The pattern we are seeing here is that no Labor government can be relied upon to tell the truth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032910"></A>
It is legitimate to ask: what will be the effect on the state’s revenues into the future if that mining super profits tax goes ahead as planned? State mining royalties will be effectively frozen at today’s levels. The ability of future sovereign states to raise their royalties will be lost. Yes, it is proposed that miners will be compensated for the royalties they pay to the states, but the Commonwealth is not likely to let its revenue stream be milked by the great mining states of Western Australia and Queensland ramping up their loyalties. It will have to be even-handed. It may want to punish, say, Western Australia, but it cannot do that without punishing Queensland as well. What will be the effect on our burgeoning LNG and coal seam gas industry? Why is this state Labor government not stridently protecting our collective rights in this debate? Queensland’s future will be at risk when the current war of words turns into boardroom battles about where the best return on investment can be made. And while the fight is now with the miners, it will not be the miners making the decisions as to where or where not to invest. In the final analysis, those decisions will be made by the banks and the financiers, and they will not be in Australia or within the Australian government’s sphere of influence. The second point is that it will be Queensland’s jobs that are exported to a country of their choice. </Hansard-Body>

Looking at the impact of this budget on the electorate of Noosa, I am very heartened that one of my long-running campaigns has been rewarded. I am grateful to the Minister for Police and Emergency Services that $2.2 million has been set aside to redevelop the existing fire and rescue station at Noosa, which will commence with a $1.1 million allocation in the 2010-11 financial year. I welcome this commitment, but I have heard that, supposedly due to a lack of funds, shortcuts are already being proposed. The redevelopment of the fire station is effectively allocating money from the maintenance schedule that has never been spent at Noosa. Once the work is completed, it will be a long time before the government looks at this site again. I will be watching closely to ensure that this overdue and very necessary work is done right the first time. The firies of Noosa have had to put up with second or third best for far too long. I am also grateful for the first $1 million for the construction of a sports clubhouse and amenities project at Girraween, adjacent to Noosa Junction. In total the project cost will be $1.5 million. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1032913"></A>
What I was dearly hoping to see was some much needed and overdue work on the road system coming into Noosa itself. The study into which of the three roads, Yandina-Coolum Road, Eumundi-Noosa Road or Cooroy-Noosa Road, is to be the major east-west arterial to enter Noosa from the Bruce Highway is long-overdue. Eumundi-Noosa Road is the most obvious as it avoids travelling through any built-up areas, but a lack of decision on the east-west arterial means that traffic is slowed, roads are too narrow, and public transport along Eumundi-Noosa and Cooroy-Noosa roads is nonexistent and, according to the government itself, dangerous. TransLink buses use those roads many times each day, but are now restricted from stopping to collect passengers who need to travel to Nambour for the hospital or to connect with train services to Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032917"></A>
The common misconception of the Noosa electorate is that it is full of high-flyers. I can assure the House that it is not. Many of the people in my electorate are battlers or are on fixed incomes. They fiercely disapprove of the introduction of a petrol tax, as they have little choice but to use their private cars as a means of getting around. The 9.1c per litre tax slug has hit them very hard. To then have road funding slashed by $254 million is another whack in the solar plexus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032918"></A>
The pseudo privatisation of the power companies, Ergon and Energex, has been a disaster for the consumer. My constituents are about to face yet another electricity price rise of more than 13 per cent. This will take the total increase to 54 per cent since that privatisation promise of no increases over CPI. One constituent told me that telemarketers from Energex advised that the reason that Energex can offer a five per cent discount is because wholesale electricity prices are falling. If that is true, why are retail prices continuing their steady march through the roof? How can retail price increases be justified if wholesale prices are falling? For future users of electric cars, the fuel costs will be out of reach. I say here that the government’s offset to that, the proposed CTP reduction of $24 per annum, is an insult. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032919"></A>
My constituents and former Noosa shire residents are also facing regular greater-than-inflation rate increases. Quite rightly, they question the promise made by this Labor government for economies of scale savings from forced council amalgamations, but that is not what they have seen. Rate rises, diminished services and increasing council debt are the order of the day. They are well aware that their remote megacouncil will not be compensated for the more than $13 million cost of forced amalgamation because Labor says ratepayers can afford to pay. They did not want amalgamation and if it kills me I will see a Noosa shire council reinstated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032920"></A>
Water charges are also about to rise dramatically. We watch as the black snake of the northern pipeline interconnector creeps relentlessly north to steal the water that the former Noosa council harvested so carefully. Those planned water supplies ensured population growth was sustainable. Now water is being stolen to shore up Brisbane seats that keep this morally bankrupt Labor government in power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032921"></A>
I now turn to my portfolio of climate change and sustainability. As I said at the outset, it is here where this Labor government has excelled in its cover-up. The whole-of-government administrative charges have made sifting out the facts from the fiction even more difficult than in the past. What has happened to transparency? Performance measures are well nigh impossible. The explanation reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1032922"></A>
The government’s performance management framework is being progressively implemented. The framework no longer uses the term ‘outputs’ and ‘performance measures’ that were previously used in the service delivery statements. They are replaced with ‘services’ and ‘service standards’. These terms are defined in the budget readers’ guide. Together they begin to provide information about how efficiently and effectively agencies deliver services within their approved budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1032923"></A>
A key aspect of improving performance is through measurement--that is how continuous improvement is driven--but this Labor government appears to be diminishing this tool in the public sector administration. It is certainly a hallmark of its approach to legislating that you never include any performance measure to know whether or not your objectives are being achieved. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032924"></A>
I welcome the initiative of providing a further 10 wild rivers rangers to add to the 27 already employed. However, if anyone in this House would like to see proof of where this department fails--moreover, where this government fails--it is in the area of staffing. In 2010-11 DERM will hire 47 new staff. Ten--just 10--will be in the field and on the frontline of environmental protection. I can only assume that that means the remaining 39 will be taking up more space in high-rise buildings here in Brisbane. Our national parks and protected areas are expanding but without the matching increases in resources, particularly staffing resources, which are vital to manage and care for these vast areas, control weeds, eradicate pests and prevent sediment runoff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032925"></A>
Then let us look at what is promised for the koalas. It would be good to be able to examine in some detail what is proposed, but that is difficult because of the way the information is obscured in the budget papers. I hope that what is promised really means something, as I have watched somewhat helplessly as this Labor government has dithered while the population of koalas in the south-east has declined by around 50 per cent in only three years. What is promised is $45.5 million over five years from 2010-11 with a focus on habitat restoration. This is not inspirational. It will be only a drop in the ocean to protect or enhance koala habitat. It seeks to continue to deliver the Queensland government’s koala response strategy and helps contribute to the government’s Q2 target for increased green space areas. Therefore, this $45.5 million over five years is for a multiple and overlapping set of responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036385"></A>
The sum set aside for the next financial year is around $14 million for land acquisitions and capital grants. This money looks very similar to that set aside for the purchase of remnant habitat in the Redlands area to offset this Labor government’s vandalism of the then koala habitat where the Thornlands State School is now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036389"></A>
Let us look at the $35 per tonne landfill levy on industry wastes. The waste avoidance and recycling consultation draft sets out very ambitious targets for increasing municipal recycling rates. The target is 50 per cent. The rate in 2008 was just 23 per cent, so I wonder if this target is realistic or just another ‘announcement’ by a tired government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036390"></A>
Queensland is the last state in Australia to introduce such a levy. On World Environment Day, the Premier, the Treasurer and the then acting minister jointly confessed that Queensland’s waste management industry would finally be dragged into the 21st century, but it also shows the power of a good ex-Labor minister mate. There sits Rod Welford as the new head of the Australian Council of Recyclers, appointed on 12 August 2009, and we now have a levy on which to expand an industry. This certainly is a win for the recycling industry, with a promised 7,000 jobs and an expanded industry, and it is a win for the environment if it reduces landfill by a third as projected. But it is also a win, if the government can be believed, for environmental funding particularly at the local and regional council levels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036392"></A>
Finally, I would like to put this state budget into perspective in terms of my responsibilities as a shadow minister. I love the environment. I come from Noosa. Greater Noosa is a wonderful environment with Man and the Biosphere Program status. I am passionate about the preservation of wildlife. I lament the attempted extermination of dingoes on Fraser Island. The Fraser Island dingo is the last pure strain of Australia’s largest predator and it is being demonised and mistreated by DERM staff. I weep when I see the mutilation of turtles and dugong in Far North Queensland, made all the worse by the complete inaction of the federal Labor member for Leichhardt and the four Labor state members, including a cabinet minister, who do not care about the slaughter of these animals and have not lifted a finger in terms of their protection. Nothing highlights their inaction more than Labor’s total disregard for protected species in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036394"></A>
I want us all, including my friends and colleagues in the green movement, for whom I have great respect, to look at what this portfolio should be, to look at what this portfolio could be, were it not for the financial incompetence and total disregard of this failed Labor government. In 2010-11 the state will pay $3.704 billion in interest and will pay $4.416 billion in 2011-12, $5.046 billion in 2012-13 and $5.445 billion in 2013-14. For the coming year, that is a bill of almost $10.150 million in interest every day. About $140,000 worth of opportunity has been squandered during the course of this speech.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036395"></A>
In 2010-11, the climate change and environment responsibilities of DERM are projected to cost $417.612 million. That represents about 42 days of interest payments on Labor’s massive and growing debt. To look at it a different way, we could have almost another nine climate change and sustainability departments. We could be putting a ninefold increase--that is, a 900 per cent increase--into protecting our environment, but we are not. We are, instead, throwing away the future of this state, consigning the environment of this state to a wasteland and condemning our children and their children to a Queensland far poorer, not only in dollar terms but also in lifestyle terms. The time has well and truly come when this Labor government should be consigned to the waste bin of history.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (3.03 pm): It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Bligh government’s 2010-11 state budget. It is indeed a great privilege to represent the people of the Ferny Grove electorate in this parliament. This state budget delivers on key projects and services in my electorate while maintaining the Bligh government’s commitment to create more jobs sooner. This is a responsible budget that builds on the foundations for stronger economic recovery. Our massive state-wide building program will deliver more jobs as we secure a stronger, more robust Queensland economy. Approximately 106,000 jobs will result from this building program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036398"></A>
Public transport is of vital importance to residents in the Ferny Grove electorate. While the vast majority of residents use a car to get to and from work, a significant number use the train to commute to and from work. I am proud to be a member of a government that is working hard to ensure that transport infrastructure meets the needs of Queenslanders. The proposed major upgrade of Ferny Grove Railway Station is a key step in tackling traffic congestion on the increasingly busy main Samford Road. More than 3,500 commuters currently catch the train to and from Ferny Grove station during the peak periods on normal weekdays, taking potentially up to 3,000 cars off our roads.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036399"></A>
I am delighted to inform the House that this year the Bligh government has committed $35 million as part of the $100 million duplication of the rail line between Keperra and Ferny Grove and the major upgrade and expansion of the Ferny Grove station and car park. Upgrading the station includes approximately 500 extra car parks to increase capacity to about 1,000 spaces. It will see greater capacity for public transport, and this is great news for commuters in the local area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036400"></A>
The budget will also see $1.79 million spent on 20 community housing developments in the greater Brisbane area. This means jobs for workers in the local building industry and it means housing for people who need it most. While creating jobs is great, we also need to help those less skilled to get into the workforce. That is why I am so pleased that more than $36 million will go towards assistance for low-skilled workers, those disadvantaged in the labour market, and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy in the Brisbane region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036401"></A>
I am very proud of the schools in my electorate, and I am delighted that funding has been set aside for improvements to school facilities. These works contribute to a better education for our children. The Bligh government is committed to investing in critical services such as education. We regard education spending as an investment in Queensland’s future. Over $450,000 will go towards renewing the general learning area at Ferny Hills State School. I have been talking with local principals about the importance of student safety during peak school travel times. The allocation of $45,000 in state government funding towards the provision of passenger set-down facilities at Ferny Grove State High School will help make the roads safer for our students. The Mount Samson State School has been experiencing rapid growth in student enrolments. A funding increase of $9,450 for its outside school hours care service, at a total cost of $28,350, will ensure the provision of additional coordinator hours.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036402"></A>
Other key community services will also receive a funding boost. More than $400,000 will be provided to support adults with a disability to maintain the living arrangements of their choice and to support school leavers with a disability make the transition from school to adult life. Residents will benefit also through improved and more reliable electricity supply, with over $10 million to be expended in 2010-11 on upgrading the electricity network in the Ferny Grove electorate. This will comprise: $2.55 million to finalise the improvements to network reliability in the Samford Valley, at a total project cost of $2.85 million; $1.26 million to finalise improvements to the network reliability at Arana Hills, at a total project cost of $1.4 million; and $7 million to upgrade substation capacity at Grovely, at a total project cost of $10.7 million. I know that everyone in this chamber appreciates how important it is to maintain electricity reliability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036403"></A>
The 2010-11 state budget is good news for the Ferny Grove electorate, with over $45 million being directly expended in this electorate. This expenditure will further improve vital services for the local community and deliver on the state government’s promise to create jobs and more jobs for Queenslanders. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (3.09 pm): As member for Mansfield, I welcome the 2010-11 budget. It is a budget that shows our economic strategy is delivering for Queensland. This budget delivers lower deficits, lower debt, higher growth and more jobs. The forecast, once again, is that another 100,000 Queenslanders will call our state home through the next financial year. That means we need to cater for that growth. We are determined to guide the growth for the benefit of all of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039614"></A>
A growing population requires a commitment to building infrastructure and providing new services. I am pleased to see that the electorate of Mansfield will receive a massive funding boost for roads and school infrastructure in 2010-11. We are a growing area and a changing area. We have more young families moving to Mansfield than ever before. We also have an ageing population requiring care and support.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039615"></A>
To support our population growth, we have a growing need for improved roads, hospitals and other infrastructure that will not only support our community but will generate local jobs for local families. This year’s budget delivers on Labor’s promise to create jobs and deliver infrastructure to cater for Queensland’s growing population. This is a responsible budget that builds on the foundations for a stronger economic recovery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039616"></A>
Our state-wide building program will bring us closer to achieving our 100,000 jobs target, as well as working to secure a stronger, more robust Queensland economy. Upgrades to local infrastructure will deliver better community facilities now, as well as an improved capacity to cater for the growing population. The massive building program unveiled in this year’s state budget will pave the way for our future. This budget is good for roads, good for jobs, good for education and great for the south side.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039617"></A>
However, I want more, particularly our fair share of the $20 million noise barrier package announced by the Treasurer in this year’s budget. I notice the Treasurer is listening in the chamber now. I will continue my campaign to gain funding for noise barriers along the Gateway Motorway between Mt Gravatt-Capalaba Road and Miles Platting Road.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1039619"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Fraser:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 He’s talking about the sound barriers on the Gateway upgrade, which he is a fierce advocate for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039620"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection from the Treasurer. It is an area of identified need and an issue that I have actively campaigned for on behalf of the people of Mansfield. The state government has recently announced fast-tracking part of the Gateway south project by widening the existing motorway to six lanes. More than $275 million has been provided for road and bridge upgrades as part of the Gateway Upgrade Project, with the stretch of the Gateway Motorway between Mt Gravatt-Capalaba Road and Miles Platting Road set to receive six lanes. I welcome this investment and am pleased that this government is able to deliver for my local community. However, as I am sure the constituents of Mansfield electorate will agree, the investment does highlight the need for the noise barriers to be introduced. I look forward to working with the Minister for Main Roads to have this important project delivered.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039621"></A>
This budget will also provide close to $30 million for improvements to the Tingalpa Creek intersection on Mt Gravatt-Capalaba Road, and $9.27 million on improvements to the Tingalpa Creek and Taylor Road intersection on Redland Bay Road. Mansfield relies heavily on the use of these roads, and the upgrades and improvements will certainly be welcomed by our residents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039622"></A>
Mansfield will also receive $3.34 million for the construction of bikeways on a section of the Pacific Motorway from Nathan to Logan Road in Runcorn, with a total cost of $16.33 million, and $70,000 towards the provision of passenger set-down facilities at Rochedale State High School in Rochedale. Also, there will be $3.2 million in funding for the Klumpp Road park-and-ride facility for people to use the South East Busway. As members know, I am a great supporter of the South East Busway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039623"></A>
Other infrastructure investments include $9.9 million in 2010-11 towards the refurbishment of the Belmont substation. With a total project cost of $50.3 million, the project will help maintain a reliable high-voltage electricity supply to South-East Queensland. There will also be $4.1 million to increase network capacity at Upper Mount Gravatt, at a total cost of $6.36 million. These projects will be good for our local community, great for the local economy and even better for creating local jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039624"></A>
Not only are we investing in infrastructure to keep Queenslanders employed but we are investing in education to ensure our children’s future. Education is the key to future prosperity. Our state-wide investment in education and training in this year’s budget will climb by almost $300 million this year. This includes funding for up to 316 new teachers and teacher aides as we deliver on our election commitments. Mansfield students, young and old, will benefit from a funding boost of $8.7 million to be spent on stage 2 refurbishments at the Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE, and more than $1.05 million is earmarked for refurbishments and maintenance at Wishart State School, Mansfield State High School and Rochedale State High School. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039625"></A>
Additionally, more than $430,000 has been allocated to local early education programs and the introduction of approved kindergarten programs at Mount Gravatt East State School, Pine Mountain Road Child Care and Nursery, The Village II Learning Centre, Scallywags Child Care and St Mark’s Lutheran Early Learning Centre. Earlier this year arsonists set fire to Mansfield State School, as I mentioned last night. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

The destruction of this school was horrendous and it was very sad day for our community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039631"></A>
I visited the students and staff of the school following the fire and was impressed by their resilience.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039632"></A>
Around 250 of the school’s 800 students were directly affected by the fire that destroyed several classrooms and the school tuckshop.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039633"></A>
Our student’s school work destroyed by the fire can never be replaced.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039634"></A>
However, this event brought our community together. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039635"></A>
I was impressed by the community sprit I saw during my visit to the school. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039636"></A>
I think the children even enjoyed having the school assembly in the car park that day!</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039637"></A>
But Mr Speaker, in the way of my community, we rallied together and the school was back on track quickly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039638"></A>
The school is recovering quickly and I again offer my support to the Principal, Pam Singleton, as the school recovers from this destruction.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039639"></A>
Mr Speaker, our community will also benefit from a range of investments in the community sector.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039640"></A>
Over $2 million will also be injected into local Home and Community Care funding projects to give a hand to those people who need it most.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039641"></A>
A further $1.6 million will go towards community housing and accommodation assistance programs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039642"></A>
Mr Speaker, I welcome this commitment from my colleague the Minister for Housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039643"></A>
It is important that we recognise the need for public housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039644"></A>
To reduce the level of homelessness, this Government is committed to supporting our vulnerable families, single mums and dads, our elderly and our young people who are unable to live at home or house themselves.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039645"></A>
Because Mr Speaker, a strong community needs support from Government and I welcome the budget commitments that will see the Mansfield area strengthened.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039646"></A>
There is $182,846 this coming financial year as part of a total $548,538 project cost to help young people develop skills to participate positively in their community. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039647"></A>
We will see $76,660 to provide supervised and supported programs to youth in the Mt Gravatt area, with a total State Government contribution of $229,980.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039648"></A>
$526,000 will go to Mount Gravatt District Community Support Inc through the Home Assist Secure program which aims to remove some of the practical housing-related difficulties experienced by older people and people with a disability who wish to remain living in their homes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039649"></A>
This is the type of support our community will really benefit from.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039650"></A>
There will be $369,062 towards counselling and support for young people at risk of homelessness, with a total State Government contribution of $1.11 Million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039651"></A>
And $420,171 towards an accommodation and support service for women and children escaping domestic and family violence, with a total State Government contribution of $1.26 Million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039652"></A>
This funding will complement the State Government’s domestic and family violence strategy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039653"></A>
The goal of the strategy is to better protect victims, particularly women and children, by breaking the cycle of violence as early as possible. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker, for many years I have been a volunteer for Meals on Wheels in my area.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039660"></A>
It is a role that I value, and I am pleased to help our vulnerable community members.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039661"></A>
It is for this reason that I am especially pleased to see a $71,050 investment for Home and Community Care funding to Mt Gravatt Meals on Wheels Service.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039662"></A>
There will also be $121,105 for Home and Community Care funding to Mt Gravatt District Community Support Inc. to provide domestic assistance, personal care, respite care, and social support.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039663"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039664"></A>
In my role as Minister for Child Safety, I see on a daily basis families who are under pressure and in crisis.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039665"></A>
Through solid investment by this Government, we are seeing benefits for our vulnerable families, because I know that the best way for a family to be is stable, strong and together.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039666"></A>
This investment is also building our non-government sector, their capacity will increase and our families will reap the rewards.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039667"></A>
This Government is ensuring that our partnerships with the non-government sector are strong, because Mr Speaker, Government can’t do it alone.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039668"></A>
Without our valued non-government organisations, the task of keeping Queensland strong and fair would be a lot more difficult.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This morning, I attended the Queensland Council of Social Services budget breakfast where many of our new initiatives and budget announcements were welcomed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039670"></A>
This budget also delivers on the Government’s 100,000 jobs commitment, investing $36 million in SEQ on programs to assist low skilled workers and those disadvantaged in the labour market. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039671"></A>
Mr Speaker, as the Queensland Council of Social Services will advise, keeping our families employed and financially stable is strengthening our community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039672"></A>
This is why I am proud to be part of a Government that is focussed on jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

We are focussed on creating jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1039684"></A>
As I have said previously, and as our Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, said this week, education is the cornerstone of our society, and the key to future prosperity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039685"></A>
It is a core belief, and central to our strategy as a Government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039686"></A>
Mr Speaker, I welcome the Bligh Labor Government’s 2010-11 budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039687"></A>
It focuses on delivering for Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039688"></A>
It creates jobs, it looks after our families and it strengthens our schools. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039689"></A>
It helps our vulnerable families and provides support for our elderly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039690"></A>
This is a budget that will keep Queensland strong and I look forward to seeing the benefits flow to the Mansfield Electorate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP) (3.14 pm): As we have listened to some of the rubbish that has been sprouted from the other side of the House, one could be forgiven for forgetting that this debate is a cognate debate of three pieces of legislation--the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill, the Appropriation Bill and the Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill. This suite of bills deals with Queensland’s financial future, and I compliment the Treasurer and his staff and Treasury officials on the work which has gone into planning for our future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039695"></A>
I also thank the Treasurer for his consideration in providing major funding in Keppel of up to $2 million for the demolition of the old Yeppoon Hospital and grassing the site for community use and the amount of $1.38 million for road diversion and replacement of the bridge over Stoney Creek on the Yeppoon Byfield Road. This funding will enhance the tourism value of both the Yeppoon beachfront and the Byfield rainforest area, not to mention the general community. I will mention other funding later in my speech. I thank my staff, Thelma and Teresa, for their help in advancing my work and the people of Keppel for their support.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039697"></A>
The Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill is no mystery and deals with the commencement date, and the relevant levels thereof, of certain of the benefits which are contained in the Appropriation Bill. The Appropriation (Parliament) Bill deals specifically with the funding allocation for the Legislative Assembly and Parliamentary Service. These bills speak for themselves, subject to the Estimates committee scrutiny of the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039698"></A>
The remaining bill is for the operation of government. No doubt there will be many nay-sayers, but one fact will be clear to all: many of the comments are based on sour grapes rather than on any real attempt to address the real state of Queensland’s economy. Only Labor budgets do that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039699"></A>
Sadly, this House listened to a worthless diatribe by the Leader of the Opposition which told Queenslanders nothing; it gave them no policies or outline of actions which the LNP would propose to take for Queenslanders. I am willing to offer a fairly short price that every speaker from the opposition will only carp on and really say or give nothing. They want more and more spent and criticise any revenue proposals. Once again, the LNP has proven, and will continue to prove, that ‘LNP’ really stands for ‘Look, No Policies’. I will say it again: ‘Look, No Policies’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039700"></A>
The leader and his following minions did not even know that the Labor government in Queensland created 47.8 per cent of new jobs in Australia as evidenced by the jobs figures released yesterday--8,800 out of 18,400. The member for Southern Downs claimed that government members did not operate businesses or know how they operated. A number of our members, including me, operated legal practices which advised people like him how to operate businesses, and I would suggest to him that he wake up. Sadly, he and most of his minions would be out of their depth in a rowboat in a puddle in a shopping centre car park.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs Sullivan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You’re being too kind.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039702"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection. In my electorate and the Central Queensland region generally, we have recently had spurious claims about no funding to regions and calls for a percentage of funding to be allocated from royalties. The bright spark who instigated this was the division 3 councillor for Rockhampton Regional Council, and he could not even get the level of royalties right. Not only that, he had no real knowledge of financing other than his own lifestyle. Even taking the waffle from the Leader of the Opposition at its highest, he outlined that a proportion of royalties would be spent in the regions. If that is implemented, it will mean that every hospital, school, police station and government department will close for about three months a year or work a 3 day week. Watch out, Queensland. Here we have the LNP.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039703"></A>
In a recent speech to the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce, the Treasurer gave truth to the fallacy of all funds being spent in South-East Queensland as perpetuated by ill-informed people, some of whom occupy the opposition or crossbenches in this House. He outlined that the resource sector accounts for only nine per cent of the state’s economy, employs just two per cent of the state’s workforce and royalties account for less than five per cent of taxation, which was about $1.5 billion in the current financial year.<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039762"></A>
Queensland has three avenues of raising state revenue--royalties and land rents; payroll taxes and property taxes, for example land tax; and stamp duty. As the majority of taxpaying Queenslanders live in the south east they contribute the lion’s share of state taxes and realistically the majority of GST and taxes which are returned to the state. Despite that, he outlined that for every $4,000 per person in Brisbane $5,260 per person is spent in the Fitzroy statistical division. I believe that that amount increases the further one travels from Brisbane. The education cost alone is $13,000 for a child in the state system and $7,000 for a child in the private system. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard.</Hansard-Italic>
 It has been viewed by Mr Speaker and approved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039764"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039765"></A>
Spending by the different Departments really should be amortised across the whole of Queensland. We presently have in excess of 70,000 employees in the Health Department, 10000 police and over 45000 employees in Education and many more employees across Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039766"></A>
The Health Budget is $9.99 bn, the Police Budget is $1.8 bn and Education is $9 bn+. There is an allocation of $1.3 bn for grants and subsidies to Councils across all Departments or a contribution of around $900 for every ratepayer in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039767"></A>
All of these budgeted amounts are spread across the whole of the State so anybody who claims that money is not spent in the regions is probably prone to look for fairies at the bottom of one’s garden. For instance, a total rebate of around $370 million is paid to Ergon to equalise tariffs across the State.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039768"></A>
This is a good Labor budget which supports Queenslanders and Queensland jobs. There is an infrastructure spend of $17.1 bn in addition to the massive cost for providing employees in the above Departments. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039769"></A>
This budget provides for an additional 720 nurses, 180 doctors and 300 allied health professionals, 203 new police, 316 new teachers and teacher aides and 75 ambulance officers. There will be 5 new schools and bringing forward of 40 new kindergartens (which will be solar powered), 6 new ambulance stations and 3 new kindergarten services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039770"></A>
57% of the infrastructure spending will be spent outside Brisbane which will protect 106000 jobs across the whole State. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039771"></A>
It may be instructive to read the words of Steve Greenwood of the Property Council of Australia which gives a lie to the loud and raucous cries of the LNP. He said:--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039772"></A>
“We agree with the Government that continued investment in infrastructure is critical for the Queensland economy as we continue to feel the lingering effects of the global financial crisis.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039773"></A>
The LNP would not only stop infrastructure spending but would cut 12000 jobs a year through its efficiency dividend. Take a good look at Western Australia and you will see the end results of a Liberal/National coalition. They are required to waste funds in country areas and build buildings which they cannot staff because of the decrease in employment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039774"></A>
Check the hospitals where you need to wash your own linen and there has been a decrease in cleaning and ancillary staff in both hospitals and schools. The LNP in Queensland has a terrifying program which will privatise all Government entities and put many people in those areas out of work. Let any of the Opposition Members stand in this House and deny that policy. Let them also tell us where the money is coming from to support their proposals for the residents of this State. They can do neither. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039775"></A>
The Solar Hot Water Rebate of $1000 for pensioners and concession card holders and $600 for others is continued together with the Solar Bonus Scheme of giving 44cents per kilowatt hour for surplus electricity fed back into the grid from rooftop solar PV panels.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039776"></A>
There is support for seniors throughout Queensland with $50M (increase of $12.6M) being allocated for rebate for electricity usage, a Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Commission Scheme to support concession card-holders with a medical condition, and a continuation of the half price travel for pensioners and students on buses, trains and ferries, half price car registration for pensioners, and discount travel for people with a disability. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I represent some very decent Queenslanders who realize that the Global Financial Crisis has caused major difficulties to nations throughout the world. Although Queensland has been battered, this is a Budget for the future, a Budget to protect the needs and aspirations of Queenslanders who want a decent job and proper community infrastructure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039819"></A>
This Budget will achieve that but there is still some pain before we reach our desired aim and most Queenslanders know that a Labor Government will achieve their aspirations. Better a Labor Government than a collection of hawkers peddling their own version of “snake oil” under the guise of the LNP when they have no policies, no compassion and only care to get into power so that they can start to kick Queenslanders who need help rather than unemployment and a bleak future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.20 pm): I am very honoured to be able to stand in this democratic chamber as the Independent member for Burnett and deliver a speech on our budget comprising our cognate appropriate bills during the 150th birthday celebrations of our state. Before I comment on the detail of the budget and how the budget will affect the people of the Burnett, I acknowledge the great loss this state and nation has recently experienced. Two members of the Australian Defence Force, Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland, on their first deployment to Afghanistan, have been killed by a bomb in the Army’s worst combat loss in a single day since the Vietnam War. Killed with Sapper Darren Smith was his bomb detection dog, Herbie. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039827"></A>
As members of this place we sometimes forget about the amount of blood that has been shed and what has been suffered and endured by brave Australians and Queenslanders such as Darren and Jacob and their families in order to allow us the freedom to speak in this place on behalf of our constituents. Today I would like to thank all serving members of the Defence Force and past members and their families for enduring the unendurable and suffering the unspeakable so that Queenslanders might live free. On behalf of the people of Burnett and my family, I extend my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039828"></A>
The 2010-11 Queensland state budget has been delivered in a time of world and nationwide economic uncertainty. The world is still in danger of sliding back into recession. The world’s most respected current affairs magazine, <Hansard-Italic>
The Economist</Hansard-Italic>
, recently had a picture of a shark’s fin with the headline, ‘Fear returns--How to avoid a double dip recession’. While the rest of the world’s leaders are doing everything they can to recession proof their countries’ economies, the Prime Minister of Australia is behaving irresponsibly. He is deliberately creating confusion in the mining industry which has protected our economy from the worst of the effects of the global financial crisis. Why? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039831"></A>
I would like to be able to say it is because he wants a better future for the Australian worker, but every worker or small business owner I have spoken to who relies on the mining industry to feed their family and put a roof over their head--and there are many in the electorate of Burnett--are aghast at his behaviour. One large Burnett business wiped five per cent off its projected turnover for the coming year because of Mr Rudd’s mining super tax. Mr Rudd is protecting only one person’s livelihood and that is his own. His actions are designed to take the focus away from his many political shortcomings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039832"></A>
It is vitally important that every member of this House tells Kevin Rudd that his mining industry super tax is a blatant takeover of the Queensland mining industry and places in jeopardy the mining royalties received from the mining industry from mining the coal, ore and minerals which belong to the Queensland people, not to a federal political party. The only jobs Rudd’s mining super tax will create will be jobs in Canberra not Queensland. In Queensland we have lost jobs and will lose more jobs if Mr Rudd continues with his rot. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039833"></A>
It is time that he and his deputy, Julia Gillard, concentrated on fixing the record numbers of illegal immigrants arriving in Western Australia, the massive rorting and rip-offs in the school building system and the lives lost in Garrett’s roofing insulation crisis. Just in passing, in relation to Julia Gillard, whom many are saying could be the next Prime Minister, I have to share the comments of former Labor member of federal parliament Brian Courtise who says that the federal Labor Party would be better off recruiting and putting its faith in the current New South Wales Labor Premier as their future leader because comparing Kristina--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1039839"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I return to the bill and simply mention in passing that comparing Kristina Keneally to Julia Gillard is like comparing Grace Kelly to Phyllis Diller. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039841"></A>
Before I criticise the Premier for allowing her Treasurer to spend more than we have earned, I would like to sincerely compliment her on her recent decision to stand up to an overseas mining company, Chinalco. It wanted to simply dig out the ore and put it on a ship and transport it to China for processing. If Chinalco or any other overseas mining company is allowed to carry out business like that, then we will become no more than a shovel-to-ship mining operation and we will miss out on the Queensland jobs, prosperity and advances in technology which will come if we fail to ensure that high-level processing of ore is carried out in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039843"></A>
In recent political decision making surrounding this budget there is much that is bad and needs to be commented on. We are still spending more money than we have earned. We have spent $42.4 billion while only receiving $40.7 billion, leaving an operating debt of $1.7 billion. It fundamentally means that this government cannot find savings of $1.7 billion out of a total budget of $42.4 billion in order to balance the books. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039844"></A>
That is a real worry and could be addressed by convening a deficit and debt crisis conference now comprising all political parties, economic and management experts, a few seniors in my electorate from the Carlyle retirement village and the parents and friends from the Isis kindergarten. They understand budgets implicitly. They could be commissioned with the task of finding $1.7 billion in savings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039846"></A>
I am happy to start the ball rolling with three initiatives for saving $238 million. No. 1: once again I ask this government to stop the $30 million of state funding directed to a soon to be privatised desalination plant at Agnes Water which the community no longer needs or wants. No. 2: reliable sources close to the government estimate that we could save $8 million per year simply by scrapping registration sticker labels altogether. Let us scrap them. No. 3: the Premier’s husband is employed in a useless, superfluous department of climate change sustainability costing $200 million. It does nothing. It has not and never will stop the climate from changing. Let us get rid of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039847"></A>
Ordinarily this $1.7 billion operating deficit would not be a problem but we have record current and forecasted debt from $51 billion to $81 billion. That is $14 million a day in interest payments on loans from a majority of overseas interests. We have lost our AAA credit rating meaning money costs us an extra $200 million dollars in interest payments alone. That $200 million could have been spent benefiting the people of Queensland. Indeed, benefiting the people of Burnett who all rely on, for example, the public health service at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039848"></A>
In last year’s budget the government promised to spend $2 million on the Bundaberg Hospital mental health unit. It has disappeared. I query that disappearance. Last year this government said that it would spend $26.5 million on the Bundaberg Base Hospital. The budget figures show that it spent $13.381 million. It underspent by $13.119 million on the promised budget of last year. It will spend another $16 million--$11.69 million this year and $5.1 million ongoing. I am very appreciative of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039850"></A>
To cope with the existing population we need a hospital with at least 300 public beds. All the experts say so. Toni Hoffman, nurse whistleblower, says that we need that. We cannot forget that the Burnett-Bundaberg region has one of the highest growth rates in the state. I look forward to the day when we receive a new hospital capable of coping with the existing population as well as the growth rate. We deserve it because it was the sacrifice and suffering of Burnett-Bundaberg families which saw a doubling of the state’s health budget. This year, as we have heard from many members opposite, it has reached almost $10 billion. That came about because of the focus that was placed on the health system by the crisis which, unfortunately, befelled the people of Burnett and Bundaberg five years ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039900"></A>
Earlier this week I asked the Minister for Health about leave entitlements for Toni Hoffman, the very courageous nurse whistleblower. The minister promised to act on this injustice. As of this morning, he still has not followed through on his promise. He still has not even had the decency to contact Nurse Hoffman--no excuse for treating an Australian of the Year award winner in an appalling way. All Ms Hoffman wants is a decent break and to have some time to sleep and recover from five years of continual stress. She should not have had to use her recreation leave to prepare and give evidence to two royal commissions and a criminal trial.</Hansard-Body>

The township of 1770 has received out of this budget $560,000 to complete the Joseph Banks Conservation Park redevelopment, and it is much needed. In terms of the Agnes Water Fire Station, last year this government promised to spend $500,000. It spent $300,000--underspent by $200,000--and this year it promises to spend $938,000 with no ongoing funding. We are very appreciative of the capital works money spent on the Agnes Water Fire Station. The Isis District State High School library renewal gets $560,000 of very welcome new money. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1039907"></A>
With regard to main roads throughout the Wide Bay-Burnett, there are not too many individual items listed and I am very frustrated by the various columns in the budget papers. However, I can comment that last year’s budget was $579.524 million and this year’s budget is $740.81 million. That is an increase of $161.294 million, or 28 per cent, in the overall budget for statistical division 15, and I am very appreciative of that as well. There is almost $1 billion worth of roadworks state-wide not itemised under various projects that I have identified, and I will be fighting very hard for upgrades to Elliott Heads Road and Moore Park and Gooburrum local roads as well.</Hansard-Body>

Rail and rail safety is a very important part of this budget.

This person is an ex-nurse--a valued community member who received high praise for the role that she played in rescuing the survivors of this disaster. In her past she was a theatre nurse and one of the original health professionals who started the New South Wales Health Commission. This person has made serious allegations which she has given me permission this afternoon to refer to the CMC and share with the people of Queensland. She also has phoned me and says that she can provide copies of police statements that she and her husband supplied to the police. This person alleges that there were three people in the cabin of the tilt train when it crashed and that this third unknown person--not one of the official drivers--was at the controls of the tilt train when it crashed.

she suspects that the third person who was present in the engine cabin of the train was hierarchy of Queensland Rail.

 Thank you. I come back to the Appropriation Bill. Of course, in this bill rail is very important and rail safety is very important.

With regard to the Euleilah Bridge upgrade, Baffle Creek resident and community advocate Dale Hicks has asked that I draw the attention of the House to the fact that Baffle Creek desperately needs a new bridge to replace the Euleilah Bridge. Mrs Hicks wants this place to know that one lady went over the bridge yesterday and ended up in the water. They are sick of the one-lane bridge, which is obviously a huge safety hazard and obviously floods quite regularly when it rains. I am pleased to inform the House that the lady who drove off the bridge is safe.</Hansard-Body>

There is an overseas company called Holcim, based in Switzerland, which is proposing to dig a great big hole in the ground--a quarry--near two rapidly growing coastal communities, Coral Cove and Elliott Heads, and a marine park. The residents do not want it there for a number of very good reasons--health, road safety, social and environmental reasons. It does not have to be there. Holcim has another six sites within 100 kilometres of Bundaberg that it could choose from, but by proceeding with a development proposal with the Bundaberg Regional Council, which is a major customer of the company--I consider that a very significant conflict of interest--it appears that Holcim is keeping with its appalling environmental track record and inability to properly listen to community feedback.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039943"></A>
This Holcim quarry development has already devalued the property investments of hundreds of my constituents and must be stopped. It is behaving like environmental delinquents and vandals by still proceeding with this proposal, and the community of the Coral Coast will fight this silly development proposal tooth and nail. The Coral Coast community has provided me with an overview of Holcim’s environmental track record, and both I and the Coral Coast community are appalled and do not want these people as neighbours. I simply note in tabling these documents that in 2010 Holcim was fined $280,000 in Western Australia for blasting into a heritage zone containing Indigenous rock art up to 10,000 years old; in 2008 Colombia fined Holcim $424,000 for fixing prices in 2005; and in 2006 it was fined in India for failing to comply with takeover regulations during the acquisition of associated cement companies. The EPA also classes Holcim as a high-priority violator after the Ada, Oklahoma cement plant was fined $321,000 in 2005 for violating its pollution limits more than 1,000 times in a single year. And the sorry list goes on.</Hansard-Body>

Many things concern my constituents, and the development that is proposed for the Burnett for sandmining at Gooburrum by Bundaberg Sugar, another overseas company not acting in the community and the national interest, is not welcomed by my community. When the federal government approved the sale of Bundaberg Sugar to an overseas company, I doubt that the sale would have been deemed in the national interest if it had known that Bundaberg Sugar was going to be turned into ‘Bundaberg Sand’. The proposed sandmine before the Bundaberg Regional Council is too close to residential areas and has caused property values and people’s investments to devalue. It threatens public health, safety and the environment. On behalf of my constituents, I call on all governments--local and state--to oppose this proposal.</Hansard-Body>

There is no money in this year’s budget for the Agnes Water high school. However, I thank the minister for organising the meeting with the director-general, Julie Grantham, for the Agnes Water delegation and me. Because of the great advocacy from Ali Black and her committee, it turned around from being ‘if there was going to be a high school’ to, I believe, ‘when and how big’, and I look forward to that money next year. I have been given assurances that there is money in this budget for a private consultant to start the community consultation process. That process will deliver a win-win-win regarding secondary education for the Rosedale, Miriam Vale and Agnes Water communities. Even though Labor and Liberal federal candidates are trying to deny it, this project could determine who is elected in the federal seat of Flynn. Federal co-funding will ensure that this project is an absolute certainty, fast-tracked and bigger and better. Whichever candidate promises federal co-funding for a high school at Agnes will have the affection and the votes of the Discovery Coast.</Hansard-Body>

Bargara residents and self-funded retirees Jim and Trish Filmer were disappointed to discover that there is not much in this budget for seniors. Mr Filmer stated that there is nothing there for pensioners except the silly increase in the rebate. Mr Filmer was referring to the increase in the electricity rebate from $190 to $216. He worked it out to be about 6.6c a day. In a 90-day cycle of powers bills, he said that that was an extra $5 or $15 per year. The most important thing Mr and Mrs Filmer would like to highlight is the desperate need for nursing home beds in Bargara. Currently there are no beds in Bargara. They have been personally fighting to see nursing home beds in Bargara for a number of years, to no avail. They said that they will not give up their fight for these beds and I am here to say that I will support them thoroughly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048228"></A>
Currently, the Bargara Police Station is operating only part-time. After-hours calls go through to the Bundaberg Police Station, therefore taking valuable police resources away from Bundaberg to attend to Bargara. The Bargara Police Station must be upgraded to a 24-hour police station to take pressure off the Bundaberg Police Station crew and to give added protection to the whole of the Burnett coast. The Moore Park community has consistently called for a police beat at Moore Park to provide better response times. They would still like to see this outcome become a reality. </Hansard-Body>

It is been identified that Bundaberg needs a family orientated recreational facility in the area. A water park with an educational focus to promote and celebrate our unique coastal area, our reef and our turtles is a great idea not only to cater for the local community but also for tourists. I would like to see proper compensation for the victims of Queensland Health’s mistakes. I look forward to a day when Independent members of this place will play a vital role in the reform of the budget and better budgets in the future. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (3.40 pm): Today, I rise to speak to the Queensland 2010 budget--the Appropriation Bill 2010, the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill 2010 and the Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill. In standing to speak to this budget, it is hard to know where to begin. So I thought that I would begin by looking at the history of the Bligh Labor government, which would have Queenslanders believe that things are looking up. Under Labor there are things that are looking up: the cost of fuel is up 9.1c per litre, thanks to Labor; electricity prices are up by 54 per cent; water charges in the Redlands have gone up by 700 per cent over the past five years and are climbing; car registration is up; motorway tolls are up by between 30 per cent and 90 per cent; and transport costs are up and guaranteed to climb over the coming years. These are the daily costs that cripple an economy. These are the hidden costs that kill a family budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044358"></A>
I was listening to the Leader of the Opposition, John-Paul Langbroek, in his reply when he gave a vivid example of how cancerous this Labor government has been to working families. Let me remind those opposite of what it does to our community every day. Wake up in the morning at six o’clock and switch on the lights. Power bill, up by 54 per cent. At 6.10 am, take a shower. Water charges, up by 47 per cent--except in Redlands where it is significantly higher. Get the kids in the car for the school run. Registration, up by 21 per cent. </Hansard-Body>

 Know the meaning of the word ‘plagiarism’?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044360"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. I am not using more than 10 per cent, so plagiarism does not count. Stop at the petrol station and fill up. Under Labor’s new fuel tax, that is another 9.1c per litre. Traffic jams are everywhere. If you use the Gateway to try to avoid the traffic, the tolls are up by 33 per cent. At 8.30 am, drop the kids off at school. Queensland has one of the worst literacy and numeracy standards in Australia. This is a crystal clear example of what was happening to families in my electorate yesterday. It is also what happened to families in my electorate today and, under Labor, it will be what will happen to every family in Queensland tomorrow. Every day there are more increases--increases in driver’s licence costs, the cost of the rates following the new land valuations and there is more to come. What a clear demonstration of incompetence and mismanagement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044361"></A>
Having come through a boom--the greatest economic times--we went bust. We had rivers of gold--GST revenue, royalties flowing into Treasury--but we are left starving at a banquet. I am going to do a bit of a pop quiz for those opposite--</Hansard-Body>

Who said that? Wayne Swan, our Treasurer, in 2007--raining gold bars in Queensland for a decade. But we have nothing to show for it. Over 400 nurses call the Redlands electorate home. So not only do they have to put up with the increases in power, water, registration, fuel and the tolls but also, if that was not enough to cope with, some of them are caught up in the Health pay debacle. They are the people who are suffering at the hands of this government. They are the ones who are paying the price for this government’s historic incompetence. </Hansard-Body>

Our kids have had their future successes and lifestyles compromised because, in this world, you do not get do-overs, you do not get a second chance at education. The system is failing them, not the teachers. They are equally victims under this Labor government. Over 600 teachers live in my electorate and they also have to try to make ends meet. But as well as the day-to-day challenges of making ends meet, teachers will have the additional responsibility of implementing the new national curriculum. </Hansard-Body>

In the Treasurer’s budget speech we heard the following commitment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044368"></A>
Investing in the future: giving young Queenslanders a flying start. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044369"></A>
The Treasurer stated further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044371"></A>
This includes funding for up to 316 new teachers and teacher aides. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044372"></A>
The Treasurer also went on to say that they were building five new schools. My concern is this Bligh Labor government’s dismal record. I ask the Minister for Education: are those 316 new teachers able to manage and deliver the new national curriculum when it is rolled out in 2011? Are they to be specialist teachers to roll out the new subjects? No mention is made of the new language subjects for 90 per cent of schools in Queensland in years 6, 7 and 8 at the start of 2011. Are the 316 teachers going to manage the new language subjects? How many teachers are required for the new schools? How many of those 316 teachers will go to those new schools? We are barely catching up, barely holding ground, without the new curriculum. I would like to know where the money is coming from for the new national curriculum. Where is the time coming from for the teachers to develop these four new subjects? Where is the money coming from for the new language subjects for years 6, 7 and 8? Where does the minister think he will find language teachers to deliver these specialist subjects? I suspect that it is a case of thinking things up but failing to think them through--and how Labor does that.</Hansard-Body>

There is a systematic raid on Queenslanders and the rot continues. Even taking your rubbish to the dump will incur a new tax of between $30 and $150 per tonne. My money is on the rate of the tax being at the higher end. Commerce means that that tax will be passed on to the residents. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection. We all pay at the end of the day. This budget also gives the green light to privatisation of $15 billion of assets that are owned by Queenslanders, not by this Labor government. The same Queenslanders were never once asked to approve that fire sale. I just remind members that it has been raining gold bars in Queensland for the past decade, but we have nothing to show for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044376"></A>
The same Queenslanders were never once asked if they approved of the debt being racked up: the $83.5 billion. We are talking about, though, in real terms $83,500 million. That is what $83 billion is. Today, every couple in Queensland owes $37,400. Every family of four owes $74,800. A family of six owes over $100,000. For every classroom in Queensland with 30 students in it the debt is over half a million dollars and they cannot possibly pay it. Every bus with 50 passengers in it owes just under a $1 million. Collectively, the 89 members of this chamber, the support staff and the clerks owe $1.7 million. Every one of us, every day, owe that. That is what this debt comes down to. This government has racked up more debt than any other state. Queensland residents owe double what New South Wales residents owe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044377"></A>
This is not a budget to be proud of. This is not a Smart State; it is anything but a Smart State. This year’s budget is defined by a record take. Something is wrong when a state can go bust in a boom. Queenslanders are starving at a banquet. The worst government in the history of Queensland continues to ramp up fees and charges and continues to rack up historic levels of debt. We know what this Bligh Labor government stands for: more debt, more fees, more charges, more mismanagement and more misery for Queenslanders. That is how the Premier has managed to achieve such a disapproval rating. So far, $83.5 billion in debt has been racked up. Every man, woman and child in this state owes $18,700. That is nothing to be proud of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044378"></A>
I will restate some of the commitments made by the Leader of the Opposition John-Paul Langbroek in his budget reply just so that we are all clear on those commitments. We hear often that there has been nothing from this side of the House. We have a suite of opportunities here. The LNP is committed to restoring Queensland’s AAA credit rating. We will be making that the No. 1 priority of our government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048654"></A>
That is a commitment that will benefit every resident of the Redlands and every resident of Queensland. The LNP will commit to introduce the requirement for an annual statement of debt repayment strategy to be prepared each and every year so that the people of Queensland know how we are addressing the debt problem built by Labor and that will be removed by us. That will deliver positive action to regain our AAA credit rating that all Queenslanders can see and understand. That is what good governance is all about and it is what we have not seen under Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048655"></A>
The LNP will commit to ensure new levels of transparency in government to make sure that taxpayers are getting real value for money. Every government contract over half a million dollars will be published and publicly available for scrutiny. That is open, accountable and transparent and it is something that we have not seen under Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048656"></A>
In conjunction with Tony Abbott, Warren Truss and a federal Liberal National government, the LNP will stop the super tax on mining. It will save jobs in the mining industry in Queensland and provide certainty and maintain and grow Queensland’s economy and not sell out Queensland the way our Premier has been so willing to do with our Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and our Treasurer, Wayne Swan. In the words of the federal Treasurer, it has been raining gold bars in Queensland for decades and we have nothing to show for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048657"></A>
As part of an LNP plan to secure jobs and to preserve our assets for future generations, we will put a halt to Labor’s fire sale of $15 billion worth of assets. If they are not sold they will not be sold. If the contracts are not signed they will not be signed. The LNP gives a commitment to fast-track the rebuilding of Queensland. The LNP will make the Coordinator-General, who is supposed to be responsible for streamlining and fast-tracking important infrastructure, answerable to the Premier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048658"></A>
To help small business deal with government, the LNP will make a commitment that during its first term in government it will ensure government departments pay their bills within 30 days, not the current practice of 90 days and more. The LNP’s commitment during its first term in government will be to consolidate the splintered environmental agencies into one coordinated body charged with spearheading environmental protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048659"></A>
The LNP makes this commitment to Queensland motorists: that the LNP will freeze for its entire first term in office registration fees for cars, light vehicles, along with recreational boats, trailers and horse floats. That is something that will benefit not only Redlanders but Queenslanders right across the state. To help seniors and pensioners with their living costs, the LNP will commit that it will increase the electricity rebate to 30 per cent for seniors and concession card holders and this rebate will translate from being $190 a year to $247 a year. That is real, legitimate and vital to the pensioners of Queensland. That will go a long way towards helping the many thousands of pensioners and retirees in my electorate. That is what an LNP government will deliver for Queensland. I hear talk about change coming. Believe me, a leadership change is coming. It will be a change from the Bligh Labor government to the Langbroek LNP government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048660"></A>
In my electorate things appear to be much the same. It is a budget big on reannouncement, some recurrent funding and, of course, some projects that will never be delivered because I have every faith in Labor that it will continue to overpromise and underdeliver. It has achieved $83.5 billion in debt. That debt has been racked up by this Labor government and so far every year each and every man, woman and child in Queensland is carrying a government debt of $18,700. I remind those opposite that it has been raining gold bars in Queensland for the last decade. I did not say that, members of the LNP did not say that; Wayne Swan, the federal Treasurer, said that in 2007 and it is true today. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have said it four times and I thank the honourable member for his interjection. I appreciate him taking so much interest in what I have to say. My community is looking forward to hearing what is in store for it, but it is difficult to get any real handle on the local commitment with this government because of spin, this government’s specialty. There is some reannouncement of some roadworks already completed. I am not entirely sure how that qualifies for a new budget and for a mention in this future budget. But that is Labor: overpromising and underdelivering. I fear I am getting close to repetition again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048663"></A>
The worst government in the history of Queensland continues to break Queensland’s spirit, continues to break the heart and soul of Queenslanders. The sale of Queensland assets, not Labor assets, to try to pay off the massive debt racked up by Labor when it has been raining gold bars is mismanagement. Labor sent Queensland bust in a boom. It is Queenslanders who are starving at a banquet. The pain of the asset sales is compounded by increasing fees, charges, tolls, registration, services, utilities--you name it and the Bligh Labor government has mismanaged it and we are paying the price, as are Mr and Mrs Queensland and their children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048664"></A>
There is another example of the government thinking things up but failing to think them through. The Treasurer announced that there will be a review of compulsory third party insurance so that motorists do not bear the cost of commissions paid to other parties. I highlight to the Treasurer--and I am pleased he is in the House--that there are a number of entities who benefit and rely upon those commissions. Let me list some of those beneficiaries. They are organisations such as Rotary clubs, the Autism Association, sporting clubs across the length and breadth of Queensland, chaplaincies, school P&amp;Cs, who actually pick up a trailer from those compulsory third party policies, and who knows how many more. It is not the first time that this government has seen fit to raid the community coffers. They raped and plundered the community gambling fund only recently, and that is so typical. I would like the know what the Treasurer thinks the community organisations will do to try to replace the revenues that they are about to lose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048665"></A>
There is also the sustainable future by doing the bright thing. There are a number of initiatives there. I can actually only hope that they remember to turn them all on. A school in my area that tried to do the bright thing had about $20,000 worth of solar panels installed onto the roof of the school. That was nine months ago. They are still not connected to the grid. They are still not doing the bright thing even though they have done everything in their power. That is just so very Labor: half baked, half done. I bet it is not the only school that has not finalised the process. They have been trying to arrange connection to the grid, but as I understand it the installer needs to make application. The installer has long since left the scene of the crime. I believe they are no longer in business. I have every expectation that there will be a lot more schools thinking they are doing the bright thing but they are not. That is typical of this government. It hangs around just long enough for the photo opportunity in the media cycle and then it leaves the scene of the crime. There is no ticking off, no due diligence, there is no closure or completion. That is, as I say, so typical. I am reminded of the definition of insanity: doing the same thing you have always done, the same way you have always done it and expecting a different outcome. That is just so Labor: racking up debt, mismanagement, penalising the community for the government’s own incompetence. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1048666"></A>
Leadership change is coming. With programatic specificity Labor will be removed from government to prevent it from doing even more damage to the Queensland economy and to working families. I remind members for the final time that it has been raining gold bars in Queensland for the last decade. We have gone from gold bullion to bulldust. That was a quote from the Treasurer Wayne Swan. Where did the money go? There is clearly no evidence of it. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank you for your protection.

Where did the money go? No-one knows! It is the $64,000 question. In closing, I thank the Premier, the ministers and the Labor government: thank you for putting every man, woman and child in Queensland into debt; thank you for raising taxes to record high levels; thank you for wasting our resources, our mining boom and our finances; thank you for dumbing down our schoolchildren with the worst record in this country for literacy and numeracy; thank you for taking Queensland from a low-tax state to a high-tax state; thank you for sending nurses to charity lines because they are not being paid; thank you for nothing, on behalf of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (4.00 pm): I rise to say a few words on the appropriation bills 2010. Labor budgets are about deficit and taxes. It is a bit of shame when it goes on. Orwell said that the biggest lie is the omission. That was what the last election was about, only a little over 12 months ago. The biggest lie was the omission of the fuel tax, the omission of the sale of assets and it went on and on. It really is disappointing. This government has gone bust in a boom. The shadow Treasurer has highlighted the issues that need to be highlighted, so I will run through a few items that are disappointing for my area. Of course, as the previous speaker said, the $18,700 debt for every Queensland man, woman and child is very disappointing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048710"></A>
The Building the Education Revolution program, which this state government manages, is also very disappointing. Some of the buildings that are being built and the money that is being billed for them are totally inappropriate. In my area there is a school with four empty classrooms and a public hall beside it, yet a new library has been built beside its seven-year-old library. Those funds have been totally wasted. Other schools, such as Greenbank State School, are bursting at the seams. Greenbank State School is landlocked. It needs more land. Those schools need more money spent on them. Let us get the appropriate land for the appropriate schools. Every morning and afternoon traffic at the school is chaos. Let us improve facilities at those schools that need help. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048712"></A>
It is disappointing that this government cannot manage funds. For example, the Warrego Highway is federally funded so the state government does not prioritise the issues that need fixing in relation to that highway. The minister has mentioned that something like $30 million will be spent on upgrades on the Warrego Highway, but it is disappointing that the second range crossing was not prioritised by the government. Where is it on the big issues? It is lost! Where is it on the issues that are important to people? It is lost! Of course, the main reason for that is the blow-out in some of its big infrastructure projects such as the water grid, Traveston Dam and the desalination plant. I have not heard anything lately about how the desal plant is going. Is it still performing? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048714"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Cripps:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Isn’t it rusty already? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048715"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think it might be rusty already. About all the desalination plant has been generating is salt. It goes on and on. The government has wasted a lot of money. The Tugun bypass project blew out by $500 million. Five million dollars was wasted on North Bank. What do we have for it? Some mudflats. As has been said previously in this chamber, the costs of car registration, transfer duty are going up. What we really need in the Lockyer Valley is a transport facility. That would not take much to achieve. The police station is overcrowded because of the transport obligations that are being placed on it. It is the second busiest police station in Queensland for transport duties. It is so busy that people go to Toowoomba or Ipswich, half or three-quarters of an hour away, just to pay their registration bills. That is how ridiculous things are. And what do we get? All we get is a 6c a day rebate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048716"></A>
The real problem is that debt is continuing to increase. This is going to be a real problem for Queensland. We have lost our AAA credit rating, which unfortunately costs every man, woman and child about $50. What do we get to ease the burden? A $24 CTP rebate. A recycled water project for the Lockyer and Fassifern valleys should be looked at. It should be in place already to improve the agricultural economy. One of the few things that helped us through the GFC was the agricultural industry. It carried us through the tough times. It seems a waste to spend about $8 billion on a recycled water project that now sits idle, supplying a couple of power stations. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. It is virtually wasted. I call on the DNR to ensure that the project goes forward. That is where it should be located and it needs to go forward, because we need it. Cuts to the Local Government Association have caused major deficits for councils. The Lockyer council is waiting for an $8 million payment from the Premier’s department which was promised when it agreed to take on the jail facility. The council has been calling for that for over six months and it is still waiting. I am sure the Treasurer will look into that and see where it is at. I have asked a question on notice about it, so I am sure it will come out in the wash. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048720"></A>
Roads such as the old Goodna Road and Teviot Road, in the Greenbank-Logan end of my electorate, are major thoroughfares. The council needs some assistance to build new bridges on those roads. Edwards Bridge on the old Goodna Road has been found to be lacking. It has stopped the traffic flow through that area. That flow has to be increased, because some round trips have been increased by up to 40 minutes. Those issues must be picked up by this government and it must assist councils with some of that major infrastructure. These projects needs to be highlighted and taken forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048722"></A>
Myriad issues can be brought up and the shadow minister has mentioned most of them. The loss of the AAA credit rating has been terrible for Queensland. On the federal Labor resources tax, I urge the Treasurer to ensure that mismanagement by the federal Labor government does not result in the loss of jobs in the coal industry. Federal Labor and the Greens have a lot in common. Federal Labor, with its insulation program, has potentially burnt down 140,000 houses and the Greens burnt Victoria. That is about the only thing they have in common. The real problem is that we really have to get the budget deficit back in order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048725"></A>
The poor old shooters have been picked on again. The fee to apply for a licence and licence renewal fees will more than double in this budget. What for? It will hit the good, honest and hardworking shooters of Queensland who legally own guns. Do people who illegally own guns pay this fee? No, of course not! The legal gun owners will be slugged. They will have to pay for this, and the mismanagement goes on and on. The cost to oversee gun licensing in Queensland is about $6 million. Why is there an increase of $5 million? I cannot fathom why this has happened, other than that it is a pure revenue grab by the departments. It really is inappropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048726"></A>
As I have said before, I urge the government to continue to ensure that we get appropriate funding from the federal government. The Warrego Highway and the Cunningham Highway are atrocious. They both need upgrading. I have spoken to the minister responsible for the department of infrastructure, who is in the House. I have spoken previously about the issues at Ebenezer. Earlier this week I highlighted those issues in a speech to the House. I am sure the minister has a handle on all of the issues at Ebenezer. I invite him to attend a public meeting to be held at two o’clock tomorrow at Ebenezer relating to the toxic waste dump that he wants to put down there. I am sure he will be well received. </Hansard-Body>

This government struggles with the concept of naming things. It does not seem to be able to make a decision on anything. It is disappointing. Let us improve the road infrastructure and the social infrastructure. Social infrastructure will be one of the problems we will have in the Lockyer when we get this new prison. Let us make sure that we have the social infrastructure that we need--the police, the ambulance, the doctors and improvements to the hospitals. They are the sorts of things that we need to improve. Let us also ensure that we have less mismanagement of funds than what has been going on. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (6.11 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill 2010 and other bills. This year’s budget is about building the schools, hospitals and roads Queensland needs for the future. We want to deliver better services for all Queenslanders, no matter where they live in our great state. To quote from the Treasurer’s speech on Tuesday--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052829"></A>
In this State Budget we report back and recommit ourselves to this task, providing Queenslanders with a chance at the dignity of work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052830"></A>
It’s what we have always believed in. It’s what we said we would do. And it’s what we are delivering.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052831"></A>
While the opposition wants to down the tools and put up its feet--it has no policies, no new ideas--the Bligh government is pressing on full steam ahead with the biggest infrastructure program in Queensland’s history. We are committed to keeping people in jobs, and yesterday’s jobs figures show Queensland is leading the way in creating new jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052832"></A>
The budget will invest over $36 million across South-East Queensland in programs targeting low-skilled workers, those facing labour market challenges, and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy. I know that this funding will assist many people out in my local community. We, as a government, have made tough choices so we can keep investing in the infrastructure needed to manage Queensland’s growing population. We have a plan for Queensland, and the opposition has none. Our $17.1 billion building program will transform services across Queensland, especially in my electorate of Inala.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1052833"></A>
I am really pleased to talk to the House briefly about the new Darra to Richlands rail. The budget provides $51 million in 2010-11 for construction of a new rail line from Richlands to Springfield. It is part of a wider $646 million project, which will be fast-tracked by two years. This vital new piece of transport infrastructure could now be open as early as 2013. I know that the new Richlands train station in my electorate is also well on track and is now over 75 per cent complete. I am looking forward to opening next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052834"></A>
More than $104 million will be spent on a new rail line linking Darra to Richlands, with a further $25 million allocated to construct a third track between Corinda and Darra. A further $117 million has been allocated for the duplication of the Centenary Highway between Springfield and Darra, at a total cost of $414.6 million. These projects provide infrastructure to cater for our growing and existing population, linking Darra and Richlands with the greater Springfield area. The whole western corridor is growing. This will provide improved transport options for an increasing number of residents from Wacol, Forest Lake, Inala, Richlands, Camira, Ellen Grove to Springfield.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052835"></A>
The budget also commits funds to deliver vital community services in my electorate of Inala, including: $3.44 million to expand the current Inala primary healthcare service to become an Indigenous primary healthcare centre of excellence--I would like to thank the Deputy Premier for his support for this initiative; $2.39 million to complete the construction of 14 two-bedroom apartments in Darra, adjacent to the Darra Railway Station, which is being refurbished in my electorate; $1.2 million towards creating an indoor community facility at Carole Park State School, which will shortly be renamed the Ellen Grove State School; $31,000 towards construction of a recreational pathway, and supply and install fitness stations at Pollard Park, Camira, with a total state government contribution of $63,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052837"></A>
Early education is another key focus of this budget, with $400,000 to be spent on a brand-new kindergarten at Durack State School. More than $70,000 will be provided to help our local child-care centres introduce approved kindergarten programs. The budget also provides: $31,500 to assist Aspen Community Childcare Inc.; $43,200 to assist Swallow Street Child Care Association Inc.; and $85,000 towards the provision of passenger set-down facilities at St Mark’s Primary School. It is all happening in the electorate of Inala. These extra funds have been warmly welcomed. Recently I was there at the proposed school crossing with the principal and Father Tuong, and the whole school community is very appreciative of this funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052844"></A>
Finally, I could not sit down without talking briefly about the brand-new Police Academy. The budget provides funding of $50 million for the continued development of the Police Academy at Wacol, once again in the electorate of Inala. The $452 million state-of-the-art academy will replace the existing campus at Oxley. </Hansard-Body>

RECORD DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY CARE BUDGET</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052854"></A>
The Bligh Government doesn’t avoid making tough decisions. We have a plan and we’re sticking to it. It’s a plan to manage growth in the future. Thanks to the tough decisions we’ve taken, the Government is delivering a record $1.61 billion budget for Disability and Community Care Services in 2010-11.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052855"></A>
It’s a budget which will result in better care and support for Queenslanders and their families. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052856"></A>
This year’s State Budget includes:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

• 	$28.6 million for Community Mental Health Services </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057825"></A>
The budget for disability services will deliver an extra $52.5 million in funding over the next three years, including an extra $12.5 million in 2010-11 which will provide:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1057826"></A>
•	$4.4 million to support young people with a disability leaving school</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057827"></A>
This includes an extra $2 million in 2010-11 to support 140 extra school leavers with a disability. It comes on top of the $4 million we provided for post school services in 2009-10 to support 290 school leavers. These extra funds will help school leavers with a disability access employment, education and training opportunities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1052863"></A>
• 	$3.2 million to support people with spinal cord injuries</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057839"></A>
This commitment will help us deliver locally based services across Queensland to people with spinal cord injuries. It will ensure they have the support they need to move back into the community. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1057840"></A>
• 	$2.9 million for early intervention and support services for the families of children with a disability</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057867"></A>
This is part of our commitment to Queenslanders with a disability and their families. It will give parent carers a well-earned break while their children get the care and support they need.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1057868"></A>

<A ID="pgfId-1052886"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (4.17 pm): I rise to support the appropriation bills 2010 and in doing so welcome a budget that delivers on key projects and services for the electorate of Brisbane Central while maintaining the Bligh government’s commitment to creating jobs, jobs and more jobs. Unlike those opposite, our budget does not freeze building projects, our budget does not reduce the Queensland public sector and our budget is full of good policies and ideas, unlike the policy-free zone of those opposite.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052887"></A>
The electorate of Brisbane Central is a very diverse electorate, covering a wide spectrum of socioeconomic situations from the very needy to the very wealthy. That is why it is important to deliver a budget that caters for all in society, providing the basis for the creation of jobs, better housing and community projects and catering to basic human needs of health, education, security and wellbeing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052888"></A>
Having a job in hard economic times is the best way we can get Queensland moving again, and I fully support that during these hard times government steps in, stimulates the economy and creates the dignity of work. The Bligh government’s $17.1 billion Capital Works Program supports 106,000 jobs--jobs through the massive building program such as Airport Link and a record $1.6 billion building program for new hospitals and redevelopments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052890"></A>
These programs work towards delivering more jobs thus securing a stronger economic recovery resulting in a more robust Queensland. To stop our massive infrastructure program now would not be in the best interests of Queenslanders. The reason for this could not be clearer than the job figures out yesterday that show that Queensland was once again the biggest jobs generator in Australia. In one month 8,800 jobs were created for Queenslanders--almost half of the nation’s jobs created last month of 18,400. And these were not just any jobs--8,200 jobs created were full-time. That is an outstanding achievement in globally difficult times.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052942"></A>
Good governments must take up the challenge, make the tough decisions and deliver a budget that produces lower deficit, lower debt and a return to surplus sooner, just as this budget has done. This budget ticks all three key areas. This Labor government budget confirms that we remain committed and focused on continuing our economic strategy of jobs creation and training the workers of tomorrow, with a 125 per cent payroll tax rebate for employers of apprentices and trainees as well as the lowest payroll tax in the nation and a new Skills Commission to tackle skills shortages.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052943"></A>
I welcome the $290 million that has been allocated in this year’s budget to continue construction of the Brisbane Supreme and District courts, as well as funding for completion of major infrastructure projects like Airport Link. I also believe this year’s allocation of $200,000 to redevelop the emergency service complex and ambulance station at Spring Hill at a total cost of $7.03 million is money well spent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052944"></A>
However, this government also recognizes that many working families, seniors and other members of our community are doing it tough. I am pleased that this budget provides some relief in cost of living expenses. I particularly welcome the $24 cut to CTP insurance on car registration, an increase in the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors from $190 to $216.21 as well as half price car registration fees for pensioners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052945"></A>
Recently, a constituent of mine and MS advocate, Mr John Trigger, came to see me regarding a proposal for public policy to deliver a new medical cooling and heating electricity rebate scheme in Queensland. I agreed that this was a most worthwhile policy and personally lobbied the Treasurer and others in government and campaigned for the introduction of such a subsidy. I am extremely pleased that this budget delivers a new $6.7 million subsidy program to assist people who suffer a medical condition that requires the extra use of air conditioners, such as sufferers of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries and neurological conditions. This subsidy from 1 July will be $216.21 per annum. It was great to be able to ring John Trigger with the good news on budget day and thank him for bringing this matter to my attention. His efforts will now benefit all Queenslanders eligible for the medical cooling and heating electricity concession. I also wish to thank Ms Jennifer Cullen, CEO of the Brain Injury Association of Queensland, who also wrote to me on this matter in November last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052947"></A>
I also made representations for two additional budget initiatives for Brisbane Central. The first was extra funding for Kelvin Grove State College. I am very pleased that the budget allocates over $427,000 for general learning area renewal and maintenance and $45,000 towards the installation of pedestrian crossings and facilities. The second related to the fact that extra police are always welcome in the electorate of Brisbane Central, especially in the Valley Entertainment Precinct. I hope that some of the 203 extra police find their permanent place of work at the newly built and renovated Fortitude Valley Police station. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. It has been approved by the Speaker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052948"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052949"></A>
For many families in Brisbane Central, where the world class Cochlear headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located at Teneriffe, this government’s additional investment of $16.5m to double the number of cochlear implants and expand children’s hearing services over the next four years is most welcome. Cochlear has recently announced expansion in production at their Teneriffe facility and coupled with this budget’s extra funds will ensure that even more lives are changed for the better for children suffering from hearing loss.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052950"></A>
Homelessness and community services are critical issues in Brisbane Central where there are many non-government organisations located and working tirelessly to provide essential and professional services to those most in need in our community. Therefore, community infrastructure programs such as the $10m budgeted to continue construction of community housing projects in Fortitude Valley and Bowen Hills are most welcome.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052951"></A>
I also know that many Level 3 supported accommodation facility providers located in Brisbane Central will be very pleased to learn that the budget provides a land tax exemption which aligns to the land tax treatment applied to aged cared facilities. I have been lobbied about this issue in the past and I am glad that my representations to government have resulted in this outcome for providers who deliver both accommodation and personal care support, such as assistance with meals, hygiene and medication, for many needy residents in Brisbane Central.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052952"></A>
Many community organisations and families in Brisbane Central will continue to receive much needed government funding in this budget with a record spend of $1.61b, up from $1.4b last year an increase of 15.2%. For example, $658,000 for Seniors Legal and Support Service, $433,000 to support pregnant and parenting young people who are homeless and $1.6m to fund the many services provided by Co.As.It located in Newmarket, will continue to be able to provide much needed services, to mention but a few.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052953"></A>
The budget also provides $2.9m for early intervention and support services for the families of children with a disability and $2.09m will go to the Centre of National Research on Disability and Rehabilitation Medicine at Herston towards research into the acute care and rehabilitation of people injured in motor vehicle accidents.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052954"></A>
A number of key other measures in this budget that I know will greatly benefit the residents of Brisbane Central include more than $36m going towards assistance for low skilled workers, those disadvantaged in the labour market and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy in Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052955"></A>
In addition, record spending in Health of $9.99b together with the additional number of 1,200 doctors, nurses and health professionals to the front-line workforce will continue this State’s ability to provide world class health services to the people of Brisbane Central.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052956"></A>
Equally important is this year’s $33.7m to go to supporting the Queensland Institute of Medical Research at Herston, $7.8m of which is additional funding to further drive research and innovation in this crucial area of health.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052957"></A>
A healthy and active lifestyle is also essential to good wellbeing and I am very excited to have $2m allocated towards the construction of a multi-use community indoor sport and recreation centre for netball, soccer, futsal, basketball and recreation activities at Perry Park, with a total state government contribution of $4m for these much needed facilities in inner Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052958"></A>
Mr. Speaker, children are our future and this budget delivers a $9.5b education and training budget, a massive investment which means more kindergartens, 316 extra teachers and teacher aides with more than $1.38b going directly to education infrastructure improvements. I welcome an additional amount of nearly $100,000 to be spent this year assisting many kindergartens to provide approved programs for children in the year prior to Prep for many centres located in Brisbane Central.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052959"></A>
This budget also provides for strong ‘Green’ initiatives with $965m budgeted to protect our environment and natural resources and build climate change resilience. I am also pleased that the budget provides $115m over five years for a range of solar initiatives to help build our solar industry and double our solar energy turning Queensland into the Solar State. I know many residents of Brisbane Central have benefited by switching to Solar Hot Water and have taken advantage of the Government’s rebates which continue.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052960"></A>
Mr. Speaker, this budget aims to provide for the future of Queensland whilst at the same time recognizing that jobs must be a priority in tough times and providing some relief for working families, pensioners and seniors and those less fortunate in our society.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052961"></A>
Record budget allocations in health, disability services, education and our $17.1b infrastructure program are necessary and essential if Queensland is to continue to be the economic engine driver that delivers benefits for the years to come in Australia’s fastest growing and greatest State. Now is definitely not the time to cut our massive capital works job creating program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052962"></A>
I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer and Premier on delivering Queensland’s 150th budget, a budget for a very different Queensland to what it was back in 1859. A budget that has jobs and job creation at its core as well as providing record funds for those in our society less fortunate than ourselves. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052963"></A>
I know the residents of Brisbane Central will benefit from this budget’s initiatives and I look forward to advising my constituents of the many ways this budget lends a helping hand.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (4.23 pm): We cannot remind ourselves too often that Australia was the only advanced economy that did not have two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. In other words, we were the only advanced economy that did not technically go into recession. The economic adversity we continue to experience could have been much worse if we in Australia, and in this state, had not done what we have done. What makes Australia and Queensland different from the rest of the First World economies is that we did not shrink from a massive intervention in the sagging private sector economy. It was the federal and state stimulus packages, which were relatively greater here than elsewhere, which saved Australia and Queensland from going into the kind of recession, or in some cases depression, that hit other parts of the world.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052967"></A>
Uniquely here, we repudiated the economic rationalist myths about small government and nonintervention in the economy that persist in some other parts of the world. We did so to the extent that we drove our economic vehicle through terrain that stalled other economies. It was Labor economic management that steered us through. Along with the federal government, it was this Treasurer and this government that saved us from what mired other societies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052968"></A>
The forward estimates in last year’s budget indicated a revenue shortfall of $14 million over three years, but this was predicated on the assumption that Queensland would go into recession. Labor’s economic management changed all that and, as a result, the shortfall is half what it was. Some of the benefits of this good economic management will flow to my electorate of Murrumba. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

My electorate includes the strip from Griffin to Mango Hill, the fastest growing suburbs in Queensland. In the middle of this band is North Lakes, and here is where much new community infrastructure is going. $1/2 million has been budgeted towards a new ambulance station in Gregor St. West. The design phase will occur this year. Tenders will be called next year, with the station expected to be finished in 2012. There is also $850,000 for ambulance officer housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1052973"></A>
Queensland’s biggest school, North Lakes State College gets a big boost from this budget. $9 million is being made available for the construction of 14 new classrooms plus a staff centre. Years 11 and 12 will be the main beneficiaries of these facilities, due to open in 2011. Bounty Boulevard State School is also growing, and $300,000 has been set aside for a new classroom block. Subject to enrolment growth, it is expected that this new block will be constructed in 2012.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

To the north of North Lakes, in other parts of my electorate, there are also welcome developments. All of us who travel locally at peak hour know that Rothwell roundabout is not a good place to be. The beginning of a solution is being provided with $300,000 to plan improvements, and $610,000 to construct new roadworks there. Design will start this year and it is expected construction will be completed by 2012.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

One of the things my young constituents do well in is sport--especially athletics. Deception Bay Little Athletics will benefit enormously from the $148,000 in this year’s budget towards the construction of a new clubhouse at the Zammit Oval as only part of a total state contribution of nearly $1/4 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Obviously the electorate I represent is an area of high needs. These achievements are a work in progress, and of course, I will continue to make representations seeking attention to the many needs of my rapidly growing region. But this budget has been kind to the electorate of Murrumba, and for that kindness, on behalf of my constituents, I give thanks. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (4.25 pm): I rise to respond to the budget speech handed down on Tuesday by the state Treasurer. Further though, I wish to speak on behalf of the poor, beleaguered taxpayers--the rate, excise and fee payers--who are currently on their knees at the mercy of this Queensland state Labor government. Queensland was once touted as the lowest taxed state in Australia, but no more. We have had the introduction of the 9c per litre fuel tax, and electricity prices, vehicle and vessel registrations, water charges, land taxes, road tolls and public transport fares have all gone through the roof under this current Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052980"></A>
Why do we find this state budget in such a dilemma in 2010? In previous years, record mining royalties and stamp duty received from booms in both mining and real estate saw rivers of gold flow into the Treasury. Now, however, this current Labor government has blown all the cash in the process of raking up tens and tens of billions of dollars in debt. The Treasurer and the rest of this government will tell us that it is all because of the global financial crisis. Yes, that is right. Apparently, the global financial crisis is the culprit for Queenslanders bleeding financially, because the US, Greece, the United Kingdom and other economic powerhouses, like Iceland, borrowed more than they could repay and now the debt is out of control. Funnily enough though, the global financial crisis seems to have bypassed New South Wales during the last year or so. I will speak about that a little later.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052981"></A>
How can Queensland be in such a financial position because of the global financial crisis? Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan have been running around the countryside telling Australians that Australia avoided the global financial crisis because of their economic management--the same financial management which has devoured a $20 billion surplus and plunged Australia into several hundred billion dollars of debt. This is more financial management the Labor way. It is in their DNA--a few borrowed billion here and a few borrowed billion there. Does anybody on the Labor side of politics in Australia remember that a billion dollars used to be a lot of money?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052982"></A>
During question time on Tuesday, Treasurer Andrew Fraser made much of drawing a comparison between the Queensland budget and the New South Wales budget which was about to be handed down. During question time on Wednesday, the health minister continued to draw comparisons between Queensland and New South Wales. I thank the Treasurer and the health minister for their encouragement to draw comparisons between the Queensland and New South Wales state budgets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052983"></A>
Here is a comparison that will be of most interest to all Queenslanders. On Tuesday, the Queensland Treasurer announced more of the same: that Queensland would remain in deficit. Yes, the Queensland budget, under his stewardship, will limp along in the red for several more years. On the very same day, however, the New South Wales Treasurer was announcing that the New South Wales budget had returned to surplus. Yes, New South Wales was back in the black. The New South Wales Treasurer announced a surplus of $771 million and forecast a surplus of $3.5 billion in the future. The basket case that had been the New South Wales economy--with a fraction of the mine royalties that Queensland enjoys; the same New South Wales economy whose real estate industry had been in free fall since February 2004--is back in the black. Again, thank you, Treasurer, for encouraging all Queenslanders to make the comparison between your budget and the New South Wales state budget. I encourage all Queenslanders to do so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052985"></A>
It was of no surprise to anybody that the details in the Treasurer’s budget speech on Tuesday included only a tiny amount of good news for Queenslanders. The public will be thrilled to hear that the government has decided to finally let them come up for air in terms of new and increased taxes. In the last year particularly, this Labor government has made an art of belting the public with new and increased fees, charges and taxes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057933"></A>
Last Monday, on the very day the polls revealed that the government had sunk to an all-time low in the eyes of the electorate, what did the government do? In a desperate move to try to improve its standing the government announced that it would fix the $646 million Springfield rail link by 2013, two years ahead of schedule. To the people in the electorate of Inala, in surrounding electorates and in Queensland generally, I have three words: Sunshine Coast Hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057935"></A>
This current state Labor government will promise anything, anywhere, anytime, but it will not keep its promises. It has promised to construct a new hospital on the Sunshine Coast for years but it keeps on delaying it. In his budget speech on Tuesday the Treasurer said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057938"></A>
... locking in the funds for the new Sunshine Coast University Hospital due to open, as we committed last year, by 2016. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057940"></A>
The only commitment the government made last year in relation to the Sunshine Coast hospital was to delay the hospital by a further two years--that is, beyond the previous commitment of it opening in 2014. It has not even turned a sod of dirt and yet last year the health minister announced further delays until 2016. The Treasurer’s attempted pea-and-thimble trick on Tuesday will not fool the people of the Sunshine Coast and it should not fool those in the rest of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057944"></A>
What about the CAMCOS rail link to the Sunshine Coast? Originally, the CAMCOS rail link from Beerwah to Caloundra was supposed to be built by 2015. That was quickly sunk by this deceitful government. Then it was supposed to reach Maroochydore by 2026. Now it will not happen until 2031, if it lets it happen at all. There are broken promises after broken promises. The people of Queensland do not believe a word uttered by this government in the form of commitments, election promises or undertakings. What we have here is a Pinocchio government. The only difference, though, is that when those opposite tell fibs to the public their noses do not grow; their arrogant egos grow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057945"></A>
What about Queensland’s GST revenue? The government has decided to hand over 33 per cent of its GST revenue to--guess who? Kevin Rudd. Here is a familiar theme. There is a federal election looming and Kevin Rudd and his Labor government are on the nose with the electorate. So in another typical, cynical Labor government move the Prime Minister thought he had better do something about the election promise he made in 2007. That promise was to fix the health system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057946"></A>
Kevin Rudd asked the state premiers to give over a bag load of GST and in return he said he would take over and fix the health system. This government, being full of Kevin Rudd disciples, has taken Kevin Rudd at his word and signed on the dotted line. In accepting this deal from ‘Kevin 07’ I sincerely hope that this government has done its due diligence. Unfortunately, I have grave fears for this shiny, new health agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057947"></A>
The list of broken promises by Kevin Rudd is almost never ending--and not just the promises made to the voters but also the promises made to Labor state premiers. Prior to the 2007 federal election Kevin Rudd got wind that the then New South Wales Premier, Morris Iemma, and the then Treasurer, Michael Costa, were intending to privatise the electricity industry in New South Wales. Having seen how well that was received in Queensland, Kevin Rudd went to Morris Iemma and asked him to hold off on those plans until after the federal election because he thought those plans might upset the unions and the public. Kevin Rudd promised to help Morris Iemma get his privatisation reforms past the unions once the federal election was over. Morris Iemma, also being a good little Kevin Rudd disciple, agreed to the Prime Minister’s request.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057951"></A>
However, once the federal election was over and Kevin Rudd was elected, what help did he give Morris Iemma with his plans? None. He broke his promise to the then New South Wales Labor Premier, Morris lemma. He would not even return Morris Iemma’s phone calls. In the end, Kevin Rudd told Morris Iemma that he would not help him as he promised; it was a state issue. Morris Iemma resigned and Michael Costa said that Kevin Rudd had backstabbed Morris Iemma. Do Labor government members opposite really believe they can trust Kevin Rudd on his promise of funding this new health reform? Would they buy a used car from Kevin Rudd? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057952"></A>
But what about the details that were left out of this Queensland budget? Here is one. The 31 May deadline for former landholders in the Mary Valley to express interest in repurchasing their properties has been extended by one month to 30 June--only one month. Remember the people of the Mary Valley? The Labor government decided to waste six or seven hundred million dollars and, at the same time, kicked a few hundred Mary Valley families out of their homes on the basis of a project destined to be consigned to infamy forever by the federal minister for stage shows and foil insulation, Peter Garrett.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057953"></A>
So why the one month extension until 30 June? Would it be so that the books are left open on the Traveston finances until after this week’s state budget? What is on the Traveston Crossing Dam balance sheet that the state government does not want to reveal in this budget? My colleague the member for Gympie has said previously, ‘In reality, if people haven’t expressed a desire to buy back the land, guess what? They don’t want to.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057954"></A>
I would now like to speak about the supply of electricity to Queenslanders under this current Labor government. In his budget speech on Tuesday the Treasurer said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057956"></A>
Lending a helping hand to those in need is fundamental to our core beliefs ... The budget I deliver today will increase the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors from $190 to $216 per household ... a helping hand to those that need it most--as is our calling. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057957"></A>
This is a welcome breath of fresh air for suffocating Queenslanders drowning in a pool of state Labor taxes. But what about the Queensland Labor government’s previous promises in relation to electricity bills? On 28 September 2005, then Premier Peter Beattie guaranteed that no-one would pay more for electricity when full retail competition came into effect in 2007. I quote from Peter Beattie’s speech. He stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057959"></A>
The announcement today is about making the retail side better for customers ... However, it is important to remember that people do not need to do anything if they do not want to. If they decide to stay with their current arrangements they will not be worse off ... the government is committed to maintaining a uniform tariff for those who choose to remain on it ... It is anticipated that the bill saving for most households could be $150 or more a year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1057960"></A>
Peter Beattie went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057962"></A>
The evidence shows that no Queenslanders will be worse off with full retail competition in the domestic electricity market. Our proposal guarantees a safety net for all Queenslanders no matter where they live. This is a smart decision that makes sense. If they want, customers can have a greater say in where they buy their electricity. If they do not, they will not be worse off. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057963"></A>
In 2007, the Beattie-Bligh electricity model came into effect and since then electricity prices have soared. In 2007-08 they went up by 11.37 per cent. In 2008-09 they went up by 9.06 per cent. In 2009-10 they went up by 11.82 per cent. In the coming year they will go up by 13.29 per cent. That is an overall increase of nearly 46 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057964"></A>
Members opposite must be so proud of what successive Labor governments, including this one, have achieved in the face of having deregulated the electricity industry here in Queensland. Certainly the Treasurer’s idea this week of a helping hand for electricity consumers is an insult to the public when Minister Stephen Robertson has refused to veto, but instead just signed off on, a 13.29 per cent increase in power bills for this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057965"></A>
Where does Stephen Robertson stand on all of this? Minister Robertson adopts the same line as health minister Lucas on the nurses pay fiasco: ‘Don’t blame me; I’m only the minister.’ Then Stephen Robertson hides from his responsibilities by blaming his independent pricing regulator for the increases. Stephen Robertson lets the pricing regulator do pretty much what it wants using the excuse of needing to build electricity infrastructure. Of course they need to continue to build infrastructure. They always have and they always will. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057966"></A>
Where was this Labor government’s foresight on power infrastructure when it was making ridiculous promises on the cost of power to the public a few short years ago? Was it a bit too hard to look a little way into the future and ponder the need for some more power poles, wires et cetera? Of course it was too hard for those opposite. They chose an easy way out and made more Pinocchio promises. Minister Stephen Robertson has the power of veto to overrule these savage price hikes but refuses to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057967"></A>
In the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 on 1 June 2010, the Premier indicated that a new, fairer electricity pricing regime will be introduced next year which could reward people who limit their power use. The Premier is quoted as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057969"></A>
We are looking at the possible introduction of a stepped pricing system that would see the very, very big users of electricity paying more than people who are using smaller and moderate amounts of electricity. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058000"></A>
Here we go again--another new system, possibly introduced and maybe next year, which might reward some lower power users. I have news for all members of this state Labor government: Queensland electricity consumers who have been subject to several years of Labor electricity are already limiting their power use because they cannot afford not to. I speak to a tsunami of electricity consumers who complain to me of their plight. They all say that they have done everything they can to reduce their electricity consumption. The government’s latest idea is based upon power consumers being able to do the impossible and lower their consumption to an unrealistic level for a happier and healthier existence. The government’s latest scheme will be a nonevent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058002"></A>
Forced council amalgamations are another example of the financial mismanagement of this Labor government. Councils were forced to amalgamate. The government agreed to pay the cost of amalgamations but has since reneged. That has left a $13.9 million black hole in the budget of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council. The government said that the council would be better off financially. Guess what? The Sunshine Coast Regional Council is not better off financially and, accordingly, the council has started to hike its rates, fees and charges.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058006"></A>
On 23 April 2010 Mayor Bob Abbot is quoted in the media as saying that the state government’s decision not to pay out the $13.9 million in amalgamation costs along with the uncertainty of revenue flow from the new Unitywater does not help the situation. Additionally, it was reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 on 29 May 2010 that ratepayers should brace themselves for massive fees and service cost increases in this coming council budget. We have to add to that the fact that the take-over of Sunshine Coast Regional Council water assets by Unitywater is only three weeks away. The council’s financial controller Greg Laverty has said that he still does not have a clear idea of the annual return, which is not surprising when only last week Unitywater CEO John Black said that the entity was yet to set a billable water price for its customers. That could be anything!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058016"></A>
In relation to the Treasurer’s budget speech, the Treasurer said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058018"></A>
The Budget adds to our commitment to the solar industry through new measures, including--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1058019"></A>
•	our new $60 million Solar Hot Water Scheme which provides a subsidy of up to $1000 to assist Queenslanders cut their power bills, and reduce the costs on our environment</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058020"></A>
There are a number of serious concerns surrounding this scheme. I am getting reports from my electorate that solar systems installed under the government’s program by government contracted installers are failing compulsory compliance inspections, as I mentioned during the last sitting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058021"></A>
The budget handed down on Tuesday by Treasurer Fraser is dependent upon these three things. Firstly, in relation to the super mining job termination tax, we need to pray that the Prime Minister gets rolled again or does a backflip like he did on the greatest moral challenge of our time--the emissions trading scheme. Secondly, we need to hope that Kevin Rudd keeps his promise in relation to the Queensland health system now that the government has given him 33 per cent of our GST revenue. Thirdly, we must hope that the global financial crisis, which apparently missed New South Wales Treasury completely, avoids making a return to Queensland. Here are the two big questions in relation to this Queensland budget: can Kevin Rudd be trusted to keep his promises? History would say no. The other question is this: can this state Labor government be trusted? History also would say no. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058025"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (4.42 pm): This state budget is a typical Labor budget that delivers more debt, more deficit, a new tax on Queensland businesses and provides little relief to Queenslanders already struggling out there in suburbs like Aspley and Carseldine. The tests I applied to this budget are twofold: is it dealing with the economic needs of Queensland, and in particular is it consistent with my action plan for Aspley; and is it addressing the lifestyle and cost issues affecting many families in my local area? Let me say at the outset that, by and large, Aspley got forgotten--again! I am starting to sympathise with my predecessor in the seat who was from the Labor Party, because Peter Beattie and now Anna Bligh clearly do not know where Aspley is. For the record, it is a lovely area just 12 kilometres north of this place and it deserves a little more attention.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058028"></A>
In saying that, I will acknowledge that one or two positive things were delivered in the budget in an otherwise miserable and desperate offering by Labor. In relation to my first test, the economic benefit for Queenslanders--and those who live in Chermside West and Bridgeman Downs are Queenslanders, something this government seems to forget--is this a good budget for Queensland? The budget confirms that government debt continues to soar, with debt reaching $18,772 for every man, woman and child in Queensland. That will be more government debt per person in Queensland than in any other state. The Treasurer has tried to claim debt is coming down but that is just another Labor attempt to mislead the Queensland people, with the budget papers confirming that debt rose from $43 billion in 2008-09 to $52 billion in 2009-10 and will keep growing to nearly $84 billion. Labor sent Queensland bust in a boom!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058030"></A>
After last year’s budget was delivered I spoke about Labor’s DNA. It has been confirmed in this year’s budget that debt, deficits and dreadful economic management are very much part of Labor’s DNA. This coming financial year, although Queenslanders will pay just over $40 billion in taxes and charges, this government will spend nearly $42 billion, leaving a budget deficit of nearly $2 billion. Every Queenslander is paying for Labor’s financial incompetence every day in every possible way--the very government that sent Queensland bust in a boom.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058031"></A>
Incredibly, this government seems almost indifferent to the cost of living pressures caused by increased electricity prices, car registration hikes, water price rises, increased tolls and the introduction of the fuel tax on ordinary Queenslanders. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday when describing the average Queensland worker when they wake up in the morning, every time Queenslanders fill up their cars, turn on the taps and flick on the lights they are paying more thanks to Anna Bligh and Labor. I could not agree more, and it is a sentiment expressed by an overwhelming number of Aspley residents that I meet as I travel around my electorate that after nearly 20 years it is just too expensive to live under this Labor government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058033"></A>
Under this Labor government electricity bills have skyrocketed by 54 per cent. Under this Labor government water charges are up by 47 per cent. Under this Labor government rego is up 21 per cent. Under this Labor government we pay 9.1c more per litre of petrol. Queenslanders are struggling under the weight of these massive increases, and that is not what we in the LNP want for Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition outlined some commitments by the LNP to the people of Queensland in his budget reply--commitments that are important to take this state forward and out of the parlous financial position created by this incompetent Labor government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058036"></A>
Queensland is the only mainland state to lose its cherished AAA credit rating. Under this Treasurer, Queenslanders will have to pay another $1.2 billion in interest on debt, all because our credit rating has been downgraded. The LNP has given a commitment to Queenslanders that restoring the AAA credit rating will be the No. 1 priority for an LNP government. Unfortunately, as evidenced by the budget before the House, this is not a priority that is shared by the current government, which seems hell-bent on taking this state further down the path of deficit after deficit.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058038"></A>
Despite polls showing 85 per cent of Queenslanders oppose the government’s privatisation plans, the Bligh Labor government is still determined to flog off Queensland’s railways, ports, motorways and forests. My office continues to receive calls and emails in relation to the fire sale of government assets, and those contacting me are not happy people. Anna Bligh and Labor have betrayed the trust of these Queenslanders. They withheld their plans about their privatisation agenda from the Queensland public before the last state election and, despite the fierce opposition to these asset sales from all Queenslanders, including the union movement, they are still refusing to back down. Now the asset sales are being fast-tracked, with the forestry business gone, the ports and railways to be sold by the end of the year and the motorways due to go to market in mid-2011. The LNP has opposed Labor’s privatisation plans every step of the way and will continue to oppose these fire sales. The Leader of the Opposition gave a commitment that as part of the LNP’s plan to secure jobs and preserve our assets for future generations we will put a halt to Labor’s fire sale of $15 billion worth of assets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058042"></A>
Queenslanders are hurting at the hip pocket. People in my electorate are hurting. I mentioned earlier that registration costs have increased dramatically, and to help Queenslanders deal with these increases the LNP has committed to freezing registration fees for cars and light vehicles, along with recreational boats, trailers and horse floats, for our entire first term in office. Furthermore, in light of massive increases in electricity, an LNP government will increase the electricity rebate for seniors and concession card holders by 30 per cent. These are tangible measures to assist people balancing their household budgets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058043"></A>
Small business is the backbone of the Queensland economy and there are many small business people in my area. Measures to make doing business easier are always welcome. The LNP’s commitment to ensure government departments pay their bills within 30 days, not the current 90 days, helps small business retain a steady cash flow that allows it to pay bills, employ more people or pay for job-creating services. That might seem like a small thing but, as someone from small business myself, I know how critical that cash flow can be. I support the initiative by the LNP to assist small businesses that have contracts with government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062960"></A>
Along with small business, the Queensland economy is strengthened by the resources sector. The federal government’s policy to introduce a super tax on mining and mining jobs, which we rely on, threatens to impede our jobs growth. If people think that this is an issue that impacts only on mining areas, I say to them to tell that to the people in my electorate who work in the service sector, the light engineering sector, the finance sector, the mums and dads who scrape together sayings for a small shareholding, for those with superannuation accounts and for those retirees who are dependent on a strong resources sector and a strong economy to keep their income coming. This proposed mining tax will affect us all. If our state is to ever regain its once cherished AAA credit rating, we have to protect Queensland jobs and we have to protect Queensland’s share of its mining royalties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062961"></A>
Regrettably, once again, I will have to report back to my constituents that, locally, we will receive few benefits from this year’s budget. The outer suburban ring has been forgotten again. People who live in places such as Aspley pay their taxes and do the right thing. They deserve better. But after 20 years in office, this Labor government has just stopped listening to what Queenslanders really want. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062962"></A>
I note that the Police Service budget is proposed to deliver an additional 203 police positions during this year. The Carseldine Police Station opened last year and the officers and the staff are doing a great job. It was the understanding of the local community that the new facility will be a fully manned, 24-hour station but, to date, it has not been allocated the general duties officers and the support staff for three full shifts. Given that the residents of Bald Hills lost their police beat and were assured that the new station would be properly resourced and manned, locals will be seeking assurances from the minister that some of the 203 extra officer positions will be allocated to the Carseldine station. This station is the only station on the Bruce Highway between Brisbane and Tiaro, near Maryborough. So locals do not think that it is unreasonable to expect that it would be a fully operational, 24-hour station. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062965"></A>
As some in the chamber might have become tired of hearing, part of my plan for Aspley includes alleviating concerns about the inaction over ever-increasing traffic queues. It appears that the residents of Aspley will see no relief in the budget to address traffic congestion in their local area. The minister says that this government is serious about tackling congestion and making life better for motorists. Clearly, he has not sat in his car at the intersection of Beams and Gympie roads at peak hour. Every day Gympie Road has 60,000 cars travelling along it. It is the major arterial for northern Brisbane, but sometimes it resembles an artery that is clogged within an inch of its life. There seems little commitment from the government to do anything about the intersections in my electorate and the grief and stress they cause locals on a daily basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

At its northern boundary, the Aspley electorate is the gateway to Brisbane. The suburbs of Bald Hills and Carseldine are heavily impacted by increasing traffic on the roads. Just beyond the Aspley electorate border is the third fastest growing area in Australia, North Lakes and Mango Hill. That burgeoning area, with little or no public transport options for residents, means that those residents drive down the Bruce Highway to connect to public transport in my electorate, in particular the Bald Hills and Carseldine railway stations. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1062967"></A>
It is important that public transport is seen as a viable option to all commuters in order to reduce congestion. However, commuters are finding it increasingly difficult to get a seat on a train on the Caboolture line during peak hours. It is a sad fact of life for people in the northern suburbs of Brisbane that their transport infrastructure is just not keeping up with the demands that are being placed on it by an increasing population. We are all well aware that this government has failed to manage the amazing growth spurt that the south-east corner is facing. It is shameful that Labor has cut $23.3 billion of capital investment in the forward estimates. This was the capital investment that would have helped fund our increasingly busy road and rail infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062968"></A>
Indeed, there seems to be little in the way of support for any road and rail infrastructure at all in Aspley. I note that, again this year, the government has failed to commit any funding whatsoever to fixing the debacle that is the Telegraph Road open level rail crossing. I am just amazed that yesterday the minister came into this House and carried on like a pork chop over the Brisbane City Council for its apparent unwillingness to 50-50 cost share public transport with the department when the Brisbane City Council has been crying out for this government to commit 50 per cent to the elimination of this dangerous open level crossing in Brisbane’s north. What hypocrisy displayed by the minister! Here is a project where the council has offered to assist and, once again, the state government fails to commit. I would have thought that the member for Sandgate, whose residents also negotiate this level crossing daily, would champion this project on behalf of her constituents. But maybe not, as the budget is not forthcoming with funding and so the member’s residents will continue to be held captive in their cars in a line of traffic that stretches all the way back to Mustang Street for the foreseeable future. It just gets worse and worse every day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062971"></A>
It is not just the current lack of funding for our roads; it is also the seemingly lax attitude of this government in terms of a willingness to plan for infrastructure on the north side for future population growth. On a number of occasions members would have heard me speak about the ULDA’s proposed redevelopment of the QUT campus playing fields, which will take valuable local green space from the community and replace it with high-rise development. Notwithstanding the desire of the community to retain this green space as part of an educational facility, there are very real concerns about the lack of infrastructure to cater for 6,500 people who will call the Fitzgibbon urban development home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062973"></A>
I note that the budget has not provided any funding for the extension to the Northern Busway through to Bracken Ridge, which is quite incredible now that the ULDA’s Fitzgibbon Chase is already underway and being developed and marketed as a transport orientated development. The only problem is that there is no transport. If there is a demonstration of the Labor government’s inability to understand growth issues and listen to local concerns, it is at Fitzgibbon and Aspley where, yet again, it approves development first and then thinks about the infrastructure later. In my local area people are saying that roads and transport are already under stress. While Labor continues to spend like drunken sailors and grow debt, it is making no provision for infrastructure to cope with the local growth. Residents in my area are sick of their lifestyles being eroded by a government that clearly does not care about Aspley. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062975"></A>
I said that I would acknowledge one or two of the positive things in the budget. It is encouraging that an amount of money has been allocated to two schools in my local area. At Bald Hills State School, provision has finally been made for a general learning area. In case this is perceived as generosity on behalf of the Treasurer, I wonder whether this funding is more being forced to respond to the somewhat alarming situation at Bald Hills State School regarding enrolment figures. The Bald Hills State School is at 98 per cent capacity and its enrolments have been increasing for some time. There will soon be too few chairs for too many students. So the parents of the students of the Bald Hills State School--and I support them--will welcome this funding to somewhat relieve the problem at that school. I say ‘somewhat’, because I have been told that this funding will renovate an existing area rather than fundamentally address the problem. I intend to follow up this matter with the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062976"></A>
There are other schools with almost as critical a problem that did not get much needed support. For example, as at February this year, Aspley East State School was at 96 per cent capacity--a five per cent increase in capacity since August 2009. This government has presided over a period where our schools are bursting at the seams. It is another example of its failure to plan. The Craigslea State High School also received the balance of its money to complete a general learning area renewal. This is, of course, an existing project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062979"></A>
In relation to early childhood education and care, I see from the budget documents that the Bald Hills State School has been funded for a kindergarten. I am supportive of children growing up with strong family support and access to good learning experiences. What does concern me is that a number of local people and operators feel that they were not properly consulted on this allocation. There is some concern that existing operators who have provided long and valuable community service might be jeopardised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062980"></A>
At the moment, the sector is under a lot of pressure, with changing guidelines and ratios adding to expenses for providers and parents, new funding models, fewer children in the age bracket owing to the implementation of prep, and other factors that both increase costs and decrease revenue. For me, locally, I want to consult with both the proposed operators of this centre and other local representatives to make sure that the balance is right so that one well-meaning expenditure in one place does not cost the parents using an existing centre in another place. From a taxpayer’s perspective, I am concerned that, as the Queensland government continues to spend and grow debt like drunken sailors, this sort of project has been shifted from Kevin Rudd’s broken promise to build 260 child-care centres to a state government whose budget is clearly broken. Taxpayers in my area want to make sure that they are getting value for money and the right considerations are being applied to ensure that the local child-care sector remains strong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063018"></A>
I pointed out that the people of Aspley feel forgotten. When local people come to my community corners, they often express the concern that for many years this government has not been addressing the things that affect their lifestyle concerns and their cost of living. Where has the money gone? The answer is simple. The Bligh Labor government has wasted and mismanaged taxpayers’ money. By its own figures, the government’s blowouts exceed $9 billion in the last three years alone. For example, while Aspley commuters have to sit in ever-increasing traffic jams, watching their petrol taxes increase and their registration increase, their tax money has been wasted on $350 million cost blowouts for a desalination plant at Tugun, $265 million wasted on the Traveston Crossing Dam, and Airport Link, which taxpayers were told was going to cost $47 million but blew out to $267 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063019"></A>
Whatever the political rhetoric and, frankly, whatever the proposed value of some of the projects, it is hardworking families in Aspley who have to carry a disproportionate share of the burden while dipping out on the proceeds of a boom that Labor has squandered. With the budget under severe pressure--I would say crisis--I can only be honest with my constituents. It is a fact that we will have to take hard decisions to put Queensland’s books in order. What I can promise is that, unlike the current government, we in the LNP do know the people of Aspley exist, we are feeling their pain and we will continue to listen to them into the future so that, as best as the budget position allows, they can look forward to getting a fairer share.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.00 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Appropriation Bill 2010 and deliver my response to the Treasurer’s budget. I certainly do not envy the Treasurer the challenge he has faced trying to fund the many necessary services for this great state of Queensland and discovering where the funding is coming from. It is certainly a difficult task to balance the needs against the ability to provide funding for those services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063022"></A>
There is no doubt that one of the greatest services that requires significant funding is health. Nearly every week there is a lead story on our local news bulletin or on the front page of our local newspapers, be it state, local or community newspapers, with a photo of a traffic accident and the story that someone has been speeding. We think of the ramifications to the families, the husbands, the wives, the children and the staff who have to attend to the people who have been affected by that speed related traffic accident, whether it be a fatality or a serious injury, and then the cost to our community, the loss of work and the need for rehabilitation. There is a very significant cost to everyone. I believe that it is time that we, as elected members of Queensland parliament, took a step forward and responded in a stronger way to this real issue of speeding on our roads, be they state, local or national roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063023"></A>
At the moment it seems to me that we are not getting the message to our drivers. Can I use by way of example recently installed speed cameras on the Sunshine Coast Highway. I have been driving that road for many years. I have seen a marked reduction in speed on that road between those two fixed speed cameras simply as a result of drivers being aware that someone may be watching. I suggest to the government, the opposition and whoever wants to listen that we need to be a bit stronger in relation to responding to this issue of speed cameras. I would urge the government or the opposition, whoever brings down next year’s budget in the next government, to bring in more unmarked police vehicles and have more hidden cameras. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063024"></A>
I do not believe we need to publicise where they are. I do not believe that we need to be intimidated by the Police Union. A representative of the Queensland Police Union says that he opposes any move to increase speed cameras because he sees it simply as a money-raising venture. He did not believe that the statistics indicated they were achieving any result. I have a different view. I believe that if it is the case that the speed cameras bring in significant revenue, that is a good thing for Queensland. We should not be intimidated by the Police Union or any other group. People should not hold the belief that they can break the speed limit and they only have to pay the price if they get caught. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063025"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
An honourable member:</Hansard-Bold>
 It is quite simple: don’t speed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063026"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Exactly. It is quite simple: do not speed. I believe that the cost to Queenslanders, our families and our communities and the cost to our government is significant and far outweighs the issue of civil liberties and the driver’s right to break the speed limit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063027"></A>
I would even go further. I would challenge the Police Union to support the introduction of specialist technicians to man these hidden cameras in unmarked police vehicles or at unmarked sites on our highways, our state roads and our local council roads. I challenge the Police Union to support the training and the skilling of specialist technicians to operate our hidden speed cameras. It costs a lot of money to train a policeman. I believe that it would be significantly cheaper to train specialist technicians who would be skilled experts who would go into court and give the necessary evidence in relation to the operation of these vehicles and that the vehicles were breaking the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063028"></A>
I urge the government to seriously consider this request. I would hope that in the future when visitors come to Queensland they will know that if they break the speed limit they will get a fine. I would hope that a future government will take up my challenge so that our roads become safer and people abide by the speed limit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063029"></A>
I now turn to some specific matters in relation to my electorate of Nicklin on the Sunshine Coast. I acknowledge the expansion of the Nambour Hospital which is currently underway--a proposed 96 beds due to come online by the end of the year. I also put on the record my concern about the need to provide adequate car parking, not just for the staff at Nambour Hospital but also for the many visitors of the patients of that soon-to-be-opened extension. So often we see a situation where the government will build a new building and then say, ‘Council, you fix up the parking issues.’ I believe that the state government has a clear responsibility to provide adequate parking for its facilities. I realise that there is further funding for the next step of the new regional hospital for the Sunshine Coast and I am certainly looking forward to a day in the future, be it under this government, the Liberal National Party or an alternative government, when we can actually see that hospital finally opened. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063030"></A>
I also wonder if there is an opportunity to have a better partnership with some of our private hospitals on the Sunshine Coast. I believe that the Noosa Private Hospital has significant reserve capacity to perform many more operations if only the state government was prepared to purchase those services from the Noosa Hospital. While speaking on hospital matters, I echo the sentiments of many members of this House in relation to the disgraceful situation of the computer system which is processing the salaries of hospital staff. I think it is absolutely disgraceful. The head of whoever is responsible should be on the chopping block. It is disgraceful that we have been able to see a change from one system, which may not have been perfect, to another system that, quite frankly, is totally unacceptable. Enough said. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063031"></A>
I also acknowledge the excellent work that our health department staff perform. They go above and beyond the call of duty in our hospitals. In relation to our Nambour Hospital, when staff are working under significant pressures sometimes mistakes happen. That is an example of why we need to always make sure there is significant reserve capacity in our hospitals, to minimise the opportunities of mistakes happening at the most inappropriate times. I recognise that there is $137.7 million allocated in the budget over the next four years for improved health services, including the expansion of a range of services on the Sunshine Coast from Nambour to Caloundra. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063032"></A>
In relation to the issue of Nambour TAFE, I acknowledge that the government has allocated a further $2.7 million towards the redevelopment of the trade training centre in Nambour. There has been significant development and significant money spent by the government since I have been in this parliament, and I thank the government for continuing that investment in our Nambour TAFE facility.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067775"></A>
I urge the government to consider bringing forward the upgrade and duplication of the railway line to Nambour. I realise properties are still in the process of being purchased, but I believe if we really want to try to remove a significant number of vehicles from our roads, the sooner we can duplicate the railway line to Nambour the better. I believe it would free up many people to catch the train and commute to Brisbane, instead of driving their vehicles on the busy roads. Whilst on the issue of railway lines and on a very local matter, I thank the Minister for Transport for responding to my calls to have the footbridge over the railway line at Cooroy resurfaced. My constituents certainly appreciate it. I note the member for Gympie acknowledged the $7.3 million allocated in the budget for the relocation of the Federal State School. I am certainly looking forward to that work starting as soon as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067777"></A>
On the issue of the Mary Valley, which has been significantly affected by the proposed Traveston Crossing dam, I put on the record my appreciation to the government for ensuring that the Gympie council area, which has the lion’s share of the Mary Valley, is included in the regional category so that people are able to access the first homeowner’s grant. I ask the government to seriously consider my request for the Sunshine Coast hinterland area of Kenilworth to be included in the regional category definition, so that people looking to buy there can also access the first homeowner’s grant. Just like Imbil and Kandanga, my part of the Mary Valley and the town of Kenilworth have been significantly affected by the proposed Traveston dam. Just over the shire boundary, communities are able to get a great start with the opportunity of accessing the first homeowner’s grant and I would hate to see Kenilworth disadvantaged. I believe we have a just case for the relaxation or variation of the guidelines so that the upper part of the Mary Valley and the Kenilworth area also would be able to access the first homeowner’s grant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067780"></A>
On the issue of balancing the budget, I note other members have spoken about the proposed federal government super tax. I will also touch on the issue because I have some real concerns. Queensland is a significant resource state. In Queensland we have seen significant income generated to help balance our books as a result of taxes and royalties that have been paid. After the resource industry has been able to assist Queensland, the federal government comes along and says, ‘We’ll put another tax on it.’ Today I received an email from the Queensland Resource Council Chief Executive, Michael Roche. I am not a great fan of Mr Roche, but some of his comments bear repeating in this chamber in my contribution to the debate, because I think they go to the very heart of the issue of the income that is generated for Queensland and for the Treasury as a result of taxes and mining royalties. I propose to read the email in full, because I do not believe I have heard any other members comment on this specifically in the debate to date. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067787"></A>
The Queensland Resources Council Chief Executive Michael Roche has welcomed a visit to central Queensland by the Prime Minister, which he said was recognition of the importance of the resources sector to the region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067788"></A>
Mr Roche said that he understood that the Prime Minister would be talking today about his proposals to allocate to Queensland resources sector infrastructure (such as rail, roads and ports) and to resource sector communities some $2 billion of the proceeds from the mining super tax.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067789"></A>
’However the people of Mackay should be asking the Prime Minister some tough questions,’ said Mr Roche. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1067790"></A>
These are the questions I would like to draw to the attention of members.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067791"></A>
Is this $2 billion an allocation over 12 years or an average of $167 million a year?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067792"></A>
Is he aware that the Queensland Resources Council estimates that existing Bowen Basin coal mines would be hit with a bill for some $30 billion for the mining super tax over those same 12 years, or an average of $2.5 billion a year?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067793"></A>
Is the Prime Minister aware that across all existing Queensland resource projects, the mining super tax bill is more like $50 billion or $4.2 billion a year over the next 12 years?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067794"></A>
Does the Prime Minister think that his promise of $2 billion in infrastructure funding is a fair return to Queensland on that $50 billion in super tax?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067795"></A>
Is the Prime Minister aware that just one rail project, the Goonyella to Abbott Point Expansion (GAPE) is expected to cost some $830 million and the Abbott Point Coal Terminal expansion to 50 million tonnes of export capacity will have cost over $800 million when completed in 2010-11? Does the Prime Minister therefore think that $2 billion over 12 years will make a serious difference to infrastructure needs in the Queensland resources sector?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067796"></A>
Does the Prime Minister agree with Treasurer Swan that some mining projects will be incurring an effective tax rate of 58% under his 40% mining super tax?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067797"></A>
Why does the Prime Minister think that an effective tax rate of 58% will allow the Queensland resources sector to be globally competitive?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067798"></A>
Why does the Prime Minister think it is okay to apply his mining super tax to existing projects, when the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax introduced by the Labor Government in the 1980s was only applied to new projects?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067799"></A>
Why does the Prime Minister think that a 40% tax rate devised for the offshore oil and gas industry is the appropriate tax rate for onshore commodities such as coal-seam gas, coal and base metals?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067800"></A>
Will the Prime Minister take the mining super tax off the table and begin genuine consultations with the resources sector?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067801"></A>
The reason I took the time to read that fully in my contribution is that I believe we need to stand up for the mining sector of Queensland. It is a significant income generator for Queensland. It is a significant income earner to balance the costs of providing the many services, not just in the growth areas but throughout Queensland. It is disappointing that the Prime Minister, for political reasons--perhaps he is trying to divide our nation with a federal election around the corner--has chosen to introduce this proposed tax in this way, bearing in mind that he is not proposing that the tax starts before the election. It is some time off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067803"></A>
I note the member for Buderim touched on another issue that I too am concerned about, that is, the cost of the amalgamation of councils on the Sunshine Coast. I realise the government had an agenda to amalgamate the former Caloundra, Maroochy and Noosa council but I echo the member for Buderim’s comments that it has proved to be very, very expensive and I believe it has continued to divide many in our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067804"></A>
On the issue of the Traveston dam, the government is looking for some way of recovering funds. I wonder what the government’s proposal is in relation to placing on the market all the land the government purchased in anticipation of the proposed Traveston dam being approved? I suggest to the government that there could be an opportunity to recoup significant dollars if that land is placed back on the market. I am looking for some guidelines from the state government, and especially from the minister, as to what the proposals will be when the land comes back on the market, if it comes back on the market. What are the proposals for the protection of the buffers along the Mary River to ensure that the valley and the endangered species are protected forever? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067805"></A>
Finally, I commend the Treasurer’s budget to the House. Certainly I urge him and other members to consider my requests for next year to be stronger. I urge the government to look at introducing significantly more hidden speed cameras and to seriously consider the issue of training special technicians to operate the speed cameras, so that they are skilled and can be classed as experts to give evidence in court. I believe that would be significantly cheaper than having qualified police officers manning that expensive equipment all the time. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (5.17 pm): I rise to speak in support of the state budget, which is a responsible budget with a focus on jobs and infrastructure building for the future. It is a strong financial plan, yet still has a heart to support Queenslanders who need it most. In this budget we are starting to see the benefits of the hard decisions that the government made last year. This budget provides for a record investment of $10 billion in Health, $9 billion for Education and a $17.1 billion state-wide infrastructure program that is supporting 106,000 jobs. That infrastructure includes the continuing work on the Pacific Motorway upgrade between Springwood South and Daisy Hill, and the $1.3 million Rochedale State High School-Springwood State High School Trade Training Centre to be built on the Rochedale State High School site. It includes funding to the Shailer Park Meals on Wheels and the Rochedale-Springwood Meals on Wheels. It includes increased funding with a focus on habitat restoration to continue to deliver the Queensland government’s Koala Response Strategy. New funding will be allocated to Child Safety Services and Community and Youth Justice Services to pilot a new early intervention and prevention initiative, Helping out Families, in the electorate of Springwood. This initiative includes intensive family support services, in-home care and brokerage and a health home visiting program for all children aged zero to three years. The budget provides new funding for the continuation of securing the M1 upgrade corridor from Daisy Hill to Loganholme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072496"></A>
These are only a few of the projects and programs in the 2010-11 budget. In my speech and on my website I will highlight the infrastructure and programs that are an investment in jobs, an investment in our regions, an investment in our local community and an investment in the future. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

I am particularly pleased to see the State Government is delivering a record $1.612 billion Budget for disability and community care services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072500"></A>
I have had a number of carers and family members tell me of the stresses they face financially, socially and emotionally. They are people that are doing everything they can for their loved one. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072501"></A>
For the rest of us who just get on with ordinary everyday lives we are often oblivious to the extra strain that can be put onto a family who is caring for someone with a disability, or a child with autism, or an elderly, frail person.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072502"></A>
An extra $72.5 million in funding for specialised disability support services over the next four years, including $12.5 million in 2010-11, will provide for a suite of early intervention initiatives for people with a disability, their families and carers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072503"></A>
Growing Stronger reforms will be implemented across the State, strengthening support for people with a disability by redesigning intake, support and service linking processes for mainstream and specialist disability services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072504"></A>
The implementation of an action plan for children with a disability aged 0 to 8 years will improve access to information, pathways and support for children with a disability and their families. When you speak with parents who do have a child/children with a disability they are always seeking more help to access support and information.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072505"></A>
I congratulate those parents in the Springwood electorate who have started up their own networks to do this. People like Penny Threfall. They do it for their own family and they do it to assist other families who find themselves in the same situation. These networks are a great support group for families and I hope they will receive more help through this action plan. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072506"></A>
A further $2.9 million in funding will provide more early intervention and support services for the families of children with a disability. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072507"></A>
Another area that causes concerns is parents who have adult children with disabilities. They are often concerned with the support available for their child to be as independent as possible.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072508"></A>
In 2010-11, funding of $15.7 million and $0.5 million in equity funding will assist younger people with a disability to access appropriate supported accommodation under the Younger People in Residential Aged Care initiative. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The transition into adulthood for young people with a disability will be made easier with $4.4 million funding in 2010-11 for skills development, training and employment support to help young people achieve a greater level of independence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072511"></A>
They are all important programs for the young person and also for their families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1072512"></A>
The other area I have heard concerns by parents is housing arrangements for their child especially as they grow older. This can often cause great distress to elderly parents. The parents often don’t want their other children to feel obliged to take over their role or in some cases they don’t have any other family members to take on a carers role.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072513"></A>
I am extremely pleased to see--$9.3 million under the Disability Assistance Package funding (from a total of $18.3 million received from the Australian Government) to provide sustainable housing arrangements for people with a disability who have ageing carers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072514"></A>
This is a fantastic start. I know just how much older carers do worry about housing arrangements for their loved one. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072515"></A>
I have had families come to me and want to set up housing developments to assist them and other families in the same situation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072516"></A>
I want to thank people like Geoff and Diane McKeich who came to me with some ideas of how a scheme could be developed then went on to lobby Bill Shorten MP, Dept of Housing and anyone who they thought should be involved. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072517"></A>
I want to thank Federal Member Bill Shorten MP for the role he has played in the implementation of this program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

There is also $11.6 million to purchase, construct and upgrade residential accommodation for non-clinical mental health services and people with a disability.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

$23 million to continue capital upgrades to infrastructure and construct purpose built accommodation, as part of a targeted response under the Positive Futures initiative for people with an intellectual and/or cognitive disability who exhibit severely challenging behaviours.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mental Health</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072523"></A>
I now want to focus on mental health. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072524"></A>
The Queensland Government is leading the nation with an $8.5 million injection over four years to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072525"></A>
One in five Australians will experience mental illness in their lifetime. These people are living in our suburbs, in our towns, and need support.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072526"></A>
It should be noted Australia was the only English-speaking OECD country that did not have a national anti-stigma campaign in place despite around 45 per cent of the Australian adult population experiencing a mental illness in their lifetime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072527"></A>
Around two-thirds of people experiencing mental illness will not seek treatment or support due to the stigma attached to it. Part of this stigma is a lack of understanding from others.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072528"></A>
There will be a $617.4 million strategy that is delivering a range of acute treatment and community-based services, including 270 treatment beds and 74 new Community Care Unit (CCU) beds. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072529"></A>
Mental illness stigma not only significantly impacts on those experiencing mental illness, it also has extensive social and economic consequences. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072530"></A>
Recent national estimates suggest that high levels of untreated mental illness in the workforce directly result in almost $6 billion in lost productivity due to absenteeism and workers who are unable to perform their jobs to their best of their ability. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072531"></A>
Lost productivity arising from people unemployed and on disability pensions as a result of a mental illness was estimated to be around $9.7 billion per year nationally. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072532"></A>
These significant costs to the individual and the community further demonstrate the need for a comprehensive effort to reduce stigma and ensure people feel they are able to access the care they need. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072533"></A>
The time for not talking about mental illness is gone. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072534"></A>
We all want people who have been injured to return to work and go back to leading a normal life. So why is it we don’t think the same way of someone who has had a mental illness? I hope that this campaign will change the way we think about people with mental illness in our communities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Our strong economic plan for the future means we can continue to invest in new and upgraded roads we need now and for the future. This year’s $3.3 billion investment in building a stronger road network also means jobs for Queenslanders--so we can continue to deliver on our promise of creating more jobs, sooner.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072628"></A>
Twelve months ago, the Government took the decision to fight for jobs, above all else. Some tough choices were made--about what to do, what not to do anymore, and what’s in the long-term interests of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072629"></A>
The Government’s determination to deliver a net new 100,000 jobs by March 2012 has never wavered. Central to that promise is our commitment to building.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072630"></A>
Building means jobs, which is why in 2010-11 we will invest $17.1 billion in infrastructure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This State Budget is a responsible budget with a focus on jobs and infrastructure building for the future. It is a strong financial plan, yet still has a heart to support Queenslanders who need it most. As this speech only has a small amount on some of the many budget areas, I encourage residents to have a look at my website www.barbarastonemp.com for information on the 2010-11 State Budget. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (5.20 pm): I rise to speak to the Appropriation Bill 2010 and, indeed, it is my great honour to do so as the member for Mount Isa. The 2010-11 budget has been framed around maintaining our $17 billion infrastructure program that supports 106,000 jobs. Right across the Mount Isa electorate there are projects large and small that are contributing to the betterment of communities and residents alike. I am confident and remain steadfast in my belief that our government is a government for all of Queensland. We have all played our part in getting through the global financial crisis. While I believe we are through the worst of it, I also think that we still have a way to go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072634"></A>
The federal government’s stimulus which is delivering incredible buildings to our schools in my electorate and the state government’s infrastructure projects committed to building hospitals, remote clinics, neighbourhood centres, social housing, kindergartens, government housing, sport and community facilities, roads and rail have seen us through the worst and kept us clear of a crippling recession. It must be recognised that capital projects in this budget deliver strongly for regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072635"></A>
This Labor government also recognises that we have people in our community who are doing it tough. This budget contains a number of measures to give people a helping hand. I compliment and thank the Treasurer and Premier for their continued support for the people in the Mount Isa electorate. I also thank the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health and the previous minister for health for their strong interest and continued support of the $65 million redevelopment of the Mount Isa Hospital. The redevelopment is well underway and when completed will take us well into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072636"></A>
The planning of the project has been extensive. We are determined to get the maximum benefit out of every dollar. Early works include renovations and refurbishment of medical and surgical wards and these are expected to be completed later this year. Painting of the wards and replacement of lighting is nearly completed. The anticipated upgrade of the old lifts in Block C is expected to begin soon and to be completed later this year. And, if you have ever ridden in these lifts, you would know why the excitement about their upgrade is at almost feverish levels.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072637"></A>
The major building projects of the redevelopment will provide new facilities to accommodate various services, as well as expand the existing emergency department. This part of the redevelopment will be started at the end of the year. The redevelopment will provide new facilities for oral health services, an outpatient’s department and mental health services. This redevelopment is vitally needed, as are the other projects across the electorate. Other works which have commenced or are in their final planning stages are the new Dajarra Health Clinic and a new health facility for Burketown. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072639"></A>
The new aged-care annex at the Cloncurry Hospital is well underway. This expansion will provide 10 aged-care places for Cloncurry residents. The redevelopment of the Winton Hospital over the next couple of years will also include a new ambulance station, and the design and construction is to be included in the overall development. Normanton will also receive a new ambulance station in this budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072640"></A>
I am extremely proud of securing this level of health funding, which is approximately $80 million for the residents of my electorate. Funding in this year’s budget to establish clinical training facilities at the James Cook University dental school at the Smithfield campus in the electorate of Barron River will greatly benefit the rest of north and outback Queensland. More teaching and training in our region of North Queensland will improve the likelihood that they will stay and practice in our region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072641"></A>
Housing construction will be for police serving in Doomadgee and Mornington Island. Health will construct units for Health staff and a further four dwellings will commence construction in Mount Isa in the latter part of the year. Two new kindergartens will be established in Mount Isa at St Joseph’s and Sunset state schools. These services are being established in areas that need them most. Both will be operational within the next two years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072642"></A>
I will continue to campaign and lobby for funding for another long day care centre in Mount Isa which is vitally needed. The targeted school maintenance, renewals and upgrades will not only breathe new life into local schools but also create local jobs. School projects include major air-conditioning and electrical upgrades, along with upgrades to general learning areas. Spinifex junior campus will receive funding for their library and the science block at the senior campus will be renewed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072643"></A>
This budget has also addressed funding for the many support services needed to deliver assistance, support and services to families in the Mount Isa electorate. I am extremely pleased with the level of support which is going into programs, particularly in the gulf and Mount Isa areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072644"></A>
This is a Bob the Builder budget. There is construction underway right across my electorate.

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (5.25 pm): I rise to speak to the 2010-11 budget bills and to say a few words about the Bligh government’s ongoing support for the state electorate of Greenslopes. The Bligh government is committed to making Queensland a stronger and safer place to live--and it is delivering on that plan with significant funding initiatives in this year’s budget that will benefit the residents of Greenslopes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072694"></A>
This is a responsible budget that lays down firm foundations for a stronger economic recovery. At the heart of this budget is a massive $17.1 billion building program that will support 106,000 jobs in the 2010-11 financial year. That is because the Bligh government is putting jobs first, and doing all it can to achieve its election promise of creating 100,000 new jobs by March 2012. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072695"></A>
Job figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics just yesterday, 10 June 2010, highlight that the government’s economic strategy is working. In just 15 months, the Bligh government is already almost halfway towards its jobs target, with 49,300 new jobs created since the state election in March 2009. This is evidence that when you have a well-developed plan and stick to it, even when things get tough, you can achieve your objectives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072696"></A>
With the economy showing signs of recovery and jobs growth improving, the outlook for Queenslanders in general, and residents of Greenslopes in particular, is looking far more positive this year. While the economic circumstances facing Queensland in 2010-11 are, fortunately, nowhere near as dire as those that confronted the government this time last year, there is no doubt that challenges still exist within the economy. Despite these challenges, the state budget has remained true to our ideals and values, with funding focused firmly on providing job opportunities for Queenslanders, securing a solid educational foundation for our children, and looking after the most vulnerable members of our society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072697"></A>
The budget recognises that Queenslanders are doing it tough, which is why compulsory third party insurance will be reduced by $24 from 1 October. Families in the Greenslopes electorate will welcome this cut in CTP insurance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072698"></A>
The 2010-11 state budget provides further relief by increasing the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors from $190 to $216 per household and will also deliver a new electricity subsidy program for vulnerable Queenslanders with medical conditions who have to use air conditioners. And pensioners will continue to enjoy a full 50 per cent discount on their vehicle registration fees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072699"></A>
The state budget also contains a suite of initiatives that not only protect our environment but also support new green jobs. In short, it is a budget that delivers on employment, education, community empowerment and environmental sustainability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072700"></A>
The 2010-11 state budget continues to deliver on Labor’s promise to create jobs--and maintains the nation’s biggest building program which will support 106,000 jobs. Employment is vital not just to the economy but also to families and individuals, and that is why this budget delivers on Labor’s promise to keep the economy growing through a massive Capital Works Program. The program of capital works is designed to meet existing needs, as well as cater for future growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072701"></A>
We know that the challenges associated with Queensland’s population growth create some issues in electorates such as Greenslopes with its long-established character suburbs. That is why the state government is devoting substantial funding to major public transport initiatives such as the Eastern Busway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072796"></A>
Residents of the Greenslopes community will benefit from $150 million in funding to continue the construction of stage 2 of this important project which runs between Buranda and Main Avenue, Coorparoo and is due for completion in 2012. The Eastern Busway will link with the network of busways that have been built by Labor governments over the past 12 years which are making it that much easier to get around Brisbane’s south side. When completed, it will improve our public transport system so that more people will be encouraged to leave their cars at home and jump on a bus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072797"></A>
I am also working closely with the local business community to find new tenants for the old Myer building and Coorparoo Mall at Coorparoo Junction. I believe that new tenants will help stimulate business activity in the area by attracting new customers. This is part of the state government’s short-, medium- and long-term plans that are being implemented to revitalise the Coorparoo Junction area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072798"></A>
The Eastern Busway is not the only project that will benefit the people of Greenslopes that is being funded by this year’s budget. Some $1 million in new funding has also been allocated to undertake planning and design work on a major redevelopment of the Queensland Museum, a popular destination for Greenslopes families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072799"></A>
Two community housing projects in my electorate will also greatly benefit from more than $2.8 million for the construction of a total of 20 community housing dwellings. These projects will not only provide accommodation for people who need it the most but also provide jobs for workers in our local building industry--an industry that has been doing it tough during the global financial crisis.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072800"></A>
This budget will also provide funding of $8.6 million to establish a bulk supply substation at Coorparoo and almost $1 million for underground cables to increase network capacity at Holland Park West. These works will provide security of electricity supply for the residents of Brisbane’s south side as well as jobs. Given that almost all members of the Legislative Assembly will be speaking on the 2010-11 budget bills, and in accordance with the Speaker’s ruling, I seek leave for the remainder of my speech to be incorporated into <Hansard-Italic>

A good education prepares young people to develop their abilities and puts them in a position to continue lifelong learning, so that they can make the most of the opportunities that life presents.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Families with children make up about 20 per cent of the constituents in the State electorate that I am privileged to represent, so our government’s investment in education is extremely important for the people of Greenslopes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072806"></A>
The Bligh Government’s investment in education and training in 2010-11 has been increased by almost $300 million, which helps fund up to 316 new teachers and teacher aides.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072807"></A>
There are eight primary schools, five high schools and one State special school in the Greenslopes electorate, and I know that parents, staff and students will be pleased to hear of these funding announcements.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072808"></A>
More than $17.2 million in this year’s education budget is being spent in the electorate of Greenslopes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072809"></A>
The largest portion of this funding is being provided for the relocation of the Brisbane School of Distance Education to Coorparoo Secondary College, with $12 million allocated to this important project. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072810"></A>
Cavendish Road State High School, Coorparoo Secondary College and Mount Gravatt State High School will each receive significant funding towards science laboratory upgrades, with more than $3 million committed to improving facilities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Cavendish Road State High School will also receive more than $500,000 for a library restoration.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072812"></A>
And just under $1 million has been allocated to general learning area upgrades for Holland Park State High School and my old primary school, Marshall Road State School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072813"></A>
Both Marshall Road State School and Mount Gravatt State High School are proudly celebrating 50 years of educating southside children in 2010.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072814"></A>
These schools are the training grounds for our next generation of Queensland leaders, who will have the future of our state in their hands.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072815"></A>
This budget also makes substantial contributions to the government’s commitment that all children will have access to a quality early childhood education by 2020.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072816"></A>
More than $120,000 will go to child care centres in and around the Greenslopes electorate, including the Adeona Early Exploration Centre, C&amp;K Mt Gravatt West, Holland Park Child Care and the Greenslopes Child Care Centre, to provide an approved kindergarten program of 15 hours a week for children in the year before Prep.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I am very pleased this budget is delivering on significant funding to foster positive school environments to ensure the continued learning and development of today’s students. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Bligh Government does not turn its back on those people in our communities who need extra support.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072821"></A>
This budget looks after Queenslanders in need, with new funding directed towards expanding the services required by some of the most vulnerable members of our society. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072822"></A>
A particular focus of this year’s budget is funding for the disabilities portfolio, which now totals $1.6 billion.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072823"></A>
The families of Greenslopes residents who care for a loved one with a disability will be pleased with statewide funding of $28 million to help those with spinal cord injuries, while $21 million will be provided statewide for young people transitioning out of school.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072824"></A>
$699,000 will go towards helping Greenslopes families care for family members with a disability who have high or complex support needs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072825"></A>
Vital funding is also being provided to community organisations to deliver improved social services to areas of greatest need. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072826"></A>
Organisations who provide community awareness, education activities and non-clinical support to people with mental illness in Greenslopes will receive more than $430,000 in funding to continue their important services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072827"></A>
Essential counselling and support services will also receive a boost of $329,000 for young people at risk of homelessness and a further $330,000 is committed to provide families with crisis or short-term accommodation and support to deal with issues placing them at risk of homelessness. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072828"></A>
This funding will ensure families who are going through difficulties will have somewhere to turn.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072829"></A>
A further $170,000 has been allocated for the development of crime prevention projects targeting young people in Greenslopes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072830"></A>
This is to reduce the risk of our young people breaking the law and coming into contact with the youth justice system.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Health</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072832"></A>
Health is also a big component of this year’s budget, with the total departmental budget reaching $9.9 billion--almost one-quarter of the State Budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072833"></A>
This funding will add another 1200 doctors, nurses and health professionals to the front-line workforce.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072834"></A>
The record building program in health will deliver 22 new and redeveloped hospitals across the state, including $110 million for the new $1.4 billion Queensland Children’s Hospital.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072835"></A>
Expert clinical advice has repeatedly confirmed that a single children’s hospital provides the best outcomes for children--and its location makes it much more accessible to southsiders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072836"></A>
The budget also provides $6.9 million towards the $134 million expansion of the Princess Alexandra Hospital’s emergency department and other facilities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072837"></A>
This expansion will triple the size of the emergency department, delivering 30 extra beds, an additional short stay bed and 25 extra treatment and assessment bays.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072838"></A>
The Princess Alexandra Hospital will also join a new persistent pain service network across Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072839"></A>
This investment will reduce the waiting list for Queensland’s only dedicated persistent pain treatment service at Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, and extend access to specialist help for sufferers of persistent pain on the southside.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Community organisations</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072841"></A>
Mr Speaker--Greenslopes is home to some very important community organisations and these have not been forgotten in this year’s budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072842"></A>
One valuable community organisation based in the Greenslopes electorate is Carers Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072843"></A>
Carers Queensland does exceptional work throughout our state to support the one in eight Queenslanders who provide unpaid care to family members and friends with physical or mental illnesses or disabilities, or who are frail. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072844"></A>
This year’s budget will provide funding of almost $2 million for Carers Queensland to extend home and community care services throughout the state. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072845"></A>
Another community organisation just outside the Greenslopes electorate that receives funding this year is the Mount Gravatt Neighbourhood Centre, which has been allocated $100,000 for a major upgrade of the centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072846"></A>
Holland Park and District Meals on Wheels also provides support for vulnerable people in our community--particularly those with a disability or who are frail.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072847"></A>
I am very pleased that this year’s budget includes more than $120,000 for this organisation to continue with their charitable food delivery services to members of the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072848"></A>
Centacare’s Amelia House will also receive home and community care funding of more than $1.3 million for centre-based day care, domestic assistance, personal care, respite care and social support.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072849"></A>
And more than $300,000 will be provided to Queensland Baptist Care to provide counselling services for families, children and young people referred by the Department of Communities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072850"></A>
I am proud to have such valuable community organisations in the Greenslopes electorate and am prouder still that this budget is providing funding, which is a true reflection of the generous work they do to make our local Greenslopes community, and our state, a better place for all.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Environmental sustainability</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072852"></A>
The environment is also very important to the people of Greenslopes and this year’s State Budget contains some significant reforms that help ensure a sustainable future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072853"></A>
The budget supports the government’s commitment to the solar industry through new measures such as the $60 million Solar Hot Water Scheme, which will provide subsidies of up to $1000 to householders to install solar hot water systems.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072854"></A>
The government has also allocated $5.8 million to the Solar Kindy Program and $35 million for the solar boost project at Kogan Creek.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072855"></A>
A new waste reform strategy will be introduced from 1 July 2011 to reduce the amount of rubbish generated and provide a pool of funding for environmental initiatives.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072856"></A>
These will include $159 million over four years to help businesses and the community reduce waste and $120 million over four years to help local councils introduce waste reduction programs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072857"></A>
The budget also funds the acquisition of more national parks, which will help us achieve our long-term goal of increasing our protected-area estate by 50 per cent by 2020.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072858"></A>
These initiatives will not only help protect our precious environment, but also stimulate job opportunities for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker--while I have the opportunity, I would like to speak briefly about the budget allocations made to the justice portfolio, for which I am responsible.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072861"></A>
The Department of Justice and Attorney-General is receiving a record $1.046 billion in 2010-11, with the focus this year on a court building program supporting thousands of jobs, more frontline staff and better services for vulnerable Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072862"></A>
The key highlights of the 2010-11 budget for the department and associated portfolio agencies include: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1072863"></A>
•	$290 million in 2010-11 for the $600 million Supreme and District Courts project, which exemplifies the Government’s commitment to strengthen the state by delivering infrastructure that anticipates growth.

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1072864"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As you can see, these initiatives contribute directly to the budget’s objectives of providing more jobs sooner and delivering services to those in our communities who are most in need.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Conclusion</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072876"></A>
Mr Speaker--in the past year, the State Government has been forced to make some tough decisions as a result of the difficult economic circumstances thrust upon us by the global financial crisis.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072877"></A>
Fortunately, we are now starting to see the positive results of those hard decisions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072878"></A>
Overall, we have a State Budget that delivers lower deficits, lower debt, higher growth and more jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072879"></A>
That is good news for the people of Greenslopes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072880"></A>
This year’s budget is not about massive handouts or sweeteners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072881"></A>
It is about delivering to the people of Queensland and continuing to make the tough, but right, decisions for the State’s future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072882"></A>
The government made the hard decisions so that we could continue to invest in our job-creating building program and better services for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072883"></A>
I am very pleased that these decisions will also contribute to securing the future for the Greenslopes community through the creation of more jobs, improving education facilities, providing support for the most vulnerable members of our community, and keeping Greenslopes green.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As the state member for Greenslopes, I am very pleased to commend these bills to the House. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (5.31 pm): I rise to add my support to the deliberations made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable shadow Treasurer in relation to the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill, the Appropriation Bill and the Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill. Queensland is in need of a change--a change of focus, a change of direction, a change to fiscal responsibility, a change of government. The only party that can deliver these changes that Queenslanders crave is the LNP. The people of Queensland have been badly let down--let down by this Premier, let down by this Deputy Premier, who cannot even pay our great nurses and doctors, and let down by a Treasurer who thinks fit to make comical jokes about the names in the asset fire sale and who is determined to send Queensland even further broke. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072889"></A>
My warning to the people of Queensland is this: if you think you have seen the worst of this government, if you think your living expenses will flatline or go down under this Labor government, do not be fooled. Each morning when you wake up, this Labor government in its determination for absolute control over your lives, continually adds financial and administrative pressures to your normal day. It is time for an LNP government--time for Queenslanders to have their Queensland back where our health system can again be the envy of all other states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072890"></A>
This change started yesterday with the Leader of the Opposition announcing that in opposition we care and we will keep the government accountable, but in government we will act and we will turn the tide in Queensland. Our LNP MPs in this place will speak with pride and conviction about their areas. We have seen 30 to 40 government members today and yesterday who cannot bring themselves to stand in this place and speak on one of the most important debates of the year for more than two minutes. They are all incorporating their speeches after a short few minutes. They do not have the intestinal fortitude to stay here past dinner. They all agree to incorporate their speeches so they can go home to bed and leave this place early. It makes a mockery of this place and it makes me sick in the stomach to think that this is what Queensland politics has come down to--a lazy government full of lazy Labor Party MPs.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1072892"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can understand the interjections when I refer to them as ‘lazy Labor Party MPs’. What was exciting about this week was the budget reply by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, where he gave the following commitments to Queensland: we will reclaim our cherished AAA credit rating; we will stop the Labor fire sale of assets; we will introduce a debt repayment strategy; we will put a stop to the super mining tax; we will put a freeze for our entire first term in government on the registration cost for cars, light vehicles, recreational boats, trailers and horse floats; we will increase the electricity rebate by 30 per cent for seniors and concession card holders; we will make sure government pays its bill to small business within 30 days, not 90; and of course we will make our government open and accountable to public scrutiny. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072894"></A>
The government members all yell out, ‘Show us your policies.’ In fact, I heard the member for Keppel earlier today say, ‘Look, no policies.’ Well, I have mentioned some of the LNP policies, but what about the constituents in the electorates of, in particular, Chatsworth, Everton, Broadwater, Cook, Barron River and Mount Isa? Let us talk about the Mount Isa constituents and the mining tax. I can tell you--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072895"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mrs Kiernan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Oh, tell us about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072896"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well, you certainly have not told us about it so someone has to tell your electorate. Madam Deputy Speaker, I will refer to the member by her title--that is, the member for Mount Isa. I can tell the member for Mount Isa that her constituents will be particularly looking at our policies and initiatives very carefully and quite positively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072897"></A>
On behalf of the Kawana electorate, I would like to state my tremendous disappointment at the state budget that was delivered by the Treasurer on Tuesday. It is a budget that offers very little to the people of the Kawana electorate and not much more to the Sunshine Coast in terms of service provision and infrastructure investment in what is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. While the Labor government and the Premier label this budget as one that invests in jobs for the future of Queensland, quite clearly the opposite is in the detail. When you get through the spin and the interjections, this is a budget with very little in substance and vision for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072898"></A>
There are two very large infrastructure projects that are earmarked for the Kawana electorate, but, as each year passes and each state budget is delivered by the Labor government, these projects continue to remain as earmarked--an indication that this government has neglected my electorate and the Sunshine Coast region in general. The neglect is paramount to a Labor government that is tired, out of ideas and broke. Labor members are showing a complete contempt for the good people of the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072899"></A>
These two vital projects are of course the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and the multimodal transport corridor. While these two projects are listed on completely separate government departmental expenditure sections in the budget papers, they are as important to each other as they are to servicing the needs of the region. For far too long the Sunshine Coast has been let down by the Labor Party--in fact, so much so that the only time the Premier could bring herself to visit us was once at the Peregian Springs State School, which the government is not even paying for. And then who could forget when she rode on the coat-tails of young Jessica Watson’s success? In fact, many questioned at the time whether we should have erected a sign on the Bruce Highway stating, ‘Premier, Sunshine Coast, turn right.’ She has shown a complete contempt and neglect for the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072902"></A>
This week marks the first anniversary of the Bligh government’s announcement that the 450-bed public component of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital would have its opening delayed from 2014 to 2016-17--a delay of some two to three years. While this delay may not look significant from afar, the situation in health services that are currently provided on the Sunshine Coast illustrates the reason this hospital ought to be brought on sooner and certainly not later as this government has done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The Sunshine Coast is, as I stated previously, one of the fastest growing regions in the country, yet the services that are offered to its residents and many tourists who visit each year are deplorable. The depth of the health crisis on the Sunshine Coast has been illustrated by the horror stories of recent months, such as people being treated in storage cupboards and patients dying in ambulances waiting to even see a doctor. These stories have been all too regular for Sunshine Coast residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072905"></A>
Nambour has the worst emergency response times in the state, and ambulance ramping is a problem which not only impacts on those waiting in the hospitals to see a doctor but obviously impacts on those waiting to get into a hospital in the first place. The picture is very grim. It shows how Labor governments in this state have continued to neglect health services on the Sunshine Coast in the boom real estate era of the last decade.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072960"></A>
While the government is happy to take the increased revenue of stamp duty with one hand, it ignores its obligation to provide adequate services required with the other. What the residents of the Kawana electorate, and indeed the Sunshine Coast, contribute to the state’s revenue is certainly not matched with the expenditure that is delivered through infrastructure, and this budget is just more of the same. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072962"></A>
The people have voted at the ballot box. There are no government seats between Pumicestone and Rockhampton. Some 2,000 people marched as one against the delay in the hospital in November last year. To date we have received over 25,000 signatures on paper and electronic petitions on the hospital’s delay, and the number keeps growing. My constituents are fed up and this government has simply given up on them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072963"></A>
While we have people dying at the Nambour emergency department, nurses and doctors not being paid, ambulance officers ramping, we have a Premier and a Deputy Premier coming in here each day taking cheap political swipes. Why do they do it? Because they just do not care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072964"></A>
While the Treasurer states that 22 hospitals are being built or redeveloped across Queensland, there was one thing missing that would have had the greatest impact in terms of service delivery and that is the 450 bed public component of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. For those members who do not know where it is--and I understand that one may not know where it is because it is still a vacant block of dirt--it is located on a large site on Kawana Way, Birtinya. So much is this government’s commitment to this hospital that it has failed to even erect a sign on the hospital site. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079984"></A>
Let us talk more about the government’s commitment to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. If one goes on to the government’s new website it launched after the Treasurer’s budget--buildingqld.premiers--it has this great interactive site where one can find projects in one’s area. So I went onto this site. I went to the first page that has the projects list. I searched ‘My community’. I will table a copy of that.</Hansard-Body>

This is an interactive guide to see how much the government is spending. If we look at Birtinya on the Sunshine Coast, where the government is investing $1.9 billion to build a hospital, so much is this commitment that it has not even rated a mention on the government’s building Queensland website. I table a copy of that. </Hansard-Body>

That shows the negligent and contempt of this government. It does not treat this hospital seriously. It puts a $75,000 roadworks project in there and it cannot even put a $1.97 billion project in there. Health does not rate a mention in the Kawana electorate despite the fact that we will have this $1.97 billion hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072981"></A>
The Premier said a few days ago that the hospital is locked in--no ifs, no buts. Would it not be good if there came a time in Queensland when we could trust this Premier. The people do not believe her anymore because there is history from this government. It said, ‘Your electricity prices will not rise. No fuel tax. Queensland, you can count on me.’ We all remember the words of the Premier. Queenslanders now know they cannot count on the Premier, not any more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072983"></A>
I say to Sunshine Coast residents: do not be fooled when the Premier, the Deputy Premier or the even the Parliamentary Secretary for Healthy Living say that it will bring beds sooner to the Sunshine Coast because it is investing in Nambour. The situation was that this Labor state government promised a 450-bed public component of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital to open in 2014. It has now been delayed to 2016. It has the hide to go to the Sunshine Coast and say, ‘Don’t worry, a private corporation is going to start building a private component and you will have beds earlier.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072987"></A>
Some 110 public beds in a private hospital does not match 450 public beds that were due by 2014. If people look at the calculation of 450 beds as opposed to 110 beds they cannot raise the argument, as this government has, as the member for Everton has on ABC radio, that it is bringing beds sooner to the Sunshine Coast because it delayed the hospital. It delayed the 450 beds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072989"></A>
The budget that was delivered by the Treasurer on Tuesday continues the government’s head-in-the-sand approach to this issue. While the bandaid solutions are continually thrown up in the tent to alleviate the immediate issues, quite clearly what is being done is not enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072991"></A>
As the legendary famous American Revolution naval fighter John Paul Jones once said, ‘I have not yet begun the fight.’ In this case the ‘I’ is the collective will of the residents of the Sunshine Coast. The people of Kawana and indeed the Sunshine Coast will not let up over these much needed public beds. The sooner the government understands that message and reinstates the initial time line the faster health provision on the Sunshine Coast will be delivered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072993"></A>
I must say that I do welcome the additional spending on health at Nambour and Caloundra hospitals. This was achieved, however, after the opposition and community became a thorn in the side of the Minister for Health and the Parliamentary Secretary for Healthy Living and forced them to spend the additional money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072995"></A>
The other most important infrastructure project that is planned for the Kawana electorate is the multimodal transport corridor or the MMTC. This major road and rail corridor will link the Sunshine Coast with the new university hospital and enable Kawana to be a major hub for health services on the Sunshine Coast. Included in this project is the CAMCOS rail project that links Caboolture to Maroochydore with major rail interchanges at Caloundra, Kawana and up through Mooloolaba. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072997"></A>
CAMCOS is a project that has been spoken about since the mid-1990s. The latest, most up-to-date departmental time lines indicate that Sunshine Coast residents should benefit from public transport infrastructure by 2031. It is said that good things come to those who wait. But waiting nearly 40 years for a rail corridor is absolutely ludicrous. This time delay indicates just how neglected the Sunshine Coast has been by Labor governments in Queensland for over a decade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073000"></A>
Come 40 years, we may all be flying our cars. If the government is serious about getting people out of their cars and on to public transport then bring it on. The precedent has been set. The government has brought forward the rail line to Springfield by two years. So I say bring forward CAMCOS and the multimodal corridor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073001"></A>
While the Premier and the Treasurer trumpet the $17.1 billion building program this government has initiated, vital Sunshine Coast services and infrastructure have been left behind at the same time as the region’s population has boomed. The MMTC fails to rate a mention in this year’s budget. While the final time line for the project is still some 16 years away, strategic planning and sequencing of the $2.1 billion project have stalled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073002"></A>
The Sunshine Coast University Hospital and the MMTC are two infrastructure projects that complement each other to service the Sunshine Coast in areas of health and transport. A key component of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital is supporting this infrastructure. Despite the delay in the university hospital, and even more beds apparently by 2021, the road and rail support infrastructure will not be finished for at least another five to 10 years after the 700 public beds and 110 private beds are available to the region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073003"></A>
The jobs generated by these two projects, both in construction and service provision, are vital to the growth of the economy in Kawana and the Sunshine Coast region. As the government fails to deliver on its promise to create an additional 100,000 jobs, I look at these two projects and see the potential to enhance service delivery in the region in health and transport and also the creation of thousands of construction and health jobs. It is simply a matter of priority and planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073005"></A>
While the budget bottom line will balloon to $84 billion in debt by 2013-14, $9 billion in the last year, what have the people of the Kawana received from the state government’s massive expenditure? Two projects--one which has been delayed by two years and the other where planning and consultation seem to have stalled from as far out as some 16 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073006"></A>
The government has racked up billions of dollars in debt. In my electorate there is very little to even show for it. Instead of investing in the state’s future, Labor sent this state bust on the back of a mining boom. Debt is the key message to come out of the state budget for 2010-11. But it is clear that this debt burden is not of concern to the Treasurer or Premier. It is of great concern that the Treasurer considers a return to a surplus budget by 2016 an achievement--10 deficits budgets in succession is an achievement. Well that is the Labor legacy--spend more than you earn and rack up public debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073007"></A>
This government, through its incompetence, has managed to show what the costs of fiscal mismanagement are to the state’s budget and also economic investment confidence locally and abroad. The Premier and the government remind me of a famous quote by Laurence J Peter where he said that ‘everyone rises to their level of incompetence’. One could argue that the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the Treasurer have certainly risen to their level of incompetence, but I would argue that they are still on the climb, as unbelievable as it may sound. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073009"></A>
Debt levels and repayment strategies seemed of little importance until the recent events in Greece and other European countries, such as the UK, highlight why racking up massive public debt in the short term will end up costing the economic outlook and prosperity of the state of a country in the long term. The Premier’s legacy is one of debt.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073050"></A>
Because we have one of the highest taxing governments in Australia, the people in my electorate would of course expect to see things like the dangerous stretch of Bruce Highway between Caloundra and Sippy Downs immediately upgraded. It is a deathtrap and, together with the member for Glass House and the community, we will not let the government get away with sitting still and doing nothing about it. One would expect that, with the highest taxes, we would not have families living in their cars. We would expect that they would have somewhere to go to have a warm shower, and I will be making the issue of homelessness one of the key battle areas this year. I want our coast families out of their cars and into proper accommodation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073053"></A>
I also commit to the Kawana electorate and to the university that I will be making it one of the top priorities to get the government interested in innovation on the Sunshine Coast and truly build our knowledge based economies. The government has invested in the innovation centre, but we need real investment in the planned innovation hub. The next election will be a choice between a Labor government that has a legacy of debt and deceit or an LNP government with a plan to reduce public debt, a plan to restore the fiscal position of the state and a plan to govern Queensland in the interests of all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073055"></A>
Throughout this debate I have seen those on the opposite side in the government idolise this Premier, idolise this Deputy Premier and idolise this Treasurer. I point out to those members opposite who do so, particularly the members for Everton and Chatsworth, who idolise the Premier, that the Premier’s disapproval rating is the highest of any Premier in 30 years. It is sitting at 69 per cent--a 69 per cent disapproval rating. It is the highest disapproval rating since records were begun in 1974, yet members opposite idolise her. Treasurer, you are the most unpopular member of this place. You might even have a higher disapproval rating than the Premier!</Hansard-Body>

Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (5.51 pm): I rise to speak in response to this year’s budget. At lunchtime I listened to the news and heard the New South Wales Treasurer say that he did not want to go down the Queensland path. That is interesting to note, but I will not persist with that. It is a pity that we do not take notice of what is said in this parliament. With regard to Forestry Plantations Queensland, it has been documented that the sale included around 35,000 hectares of freehold land, which is about 10 per cent of the total estate. However, the Queensland asset sales ‘myths and facts’ brochure released by this government states that, in terms of Forestry Plantations Queensland assets being sold, the sale was of the trees and not the land. How can we believe anything that goes on in this place? Then there was the famous statement that Queensland Rail is not for sale. What happened a few weeks later? QR was up for sale. It is disappointing that we cannot take much notice of the promises contained in this budget, and that is the way I and many people feel. Some 10 or 15 years ago former minister Bredhauer promised to four-lane the Hervey Bay-Maryborough road in my electorate. Well, we are still waiting and we are still waiting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073071"></A>
Hervey Bay has enjoyed massive population growth in recent years, and I want to address the Treasurer’s comments about this Labor government’s claimed commitment to build infrastructure and services throughout Queensland to cater for the population growth. On Tuesday we heard the Treasurer, with his hand on his heart, talk about the government’s absolute commitment to work with Queenslanders to have a building program to create jobs whilst sustaining services for an ever-growing Queensland. He said that there are 100,000 new people to Queensland each year. It is expected that Hervey Bay’s population will double in size. Hervey Bay, which had about 51,000 residents in 2006, is expected to double in size by 2026 with a population of 102,000 people. At the moment Hervey Bay is about the 29th largest city in Australia. By the year 2026 it will be the 24th largest city in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073074"></A>
What does this mean to this government? Not much, apparently! Currently, services in Hervey Bay such as health, police and disability and aged-care services are being strangled by the demand put on them by the population growth that is happening right now, and this budget falls short of what is needed. At the same time, this government continually fails to deliver. It has, however, delivered the fourth budget deficit in a row, rehashing yesterday’s news of money that was promised in last year’s budget. This does not address the real issues that are facing Hervey Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073075"></A>
Another act of trickery in this budget is the fact that the government is riding on the coat-tails of Commonwealth promises such as the already announced $16.7 million new integrated cancer service for Hervey Bay announced in the federal budget. There is no new money, just debt--a big fat deficit and the loss of our AAA credit rating. Queensland now has a debt of around $18,000 per man, woman and child. We need to know--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073077"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Fraser:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Does it really?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073078"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I said just about. We need to know what forward infrastructure planning is in place in order to progress into the future and to service the population explosion in areas such as Hervey Bay. In my experience, if you do not get ahead of the game in infrastructure and planning you will never catch up. All of the dollar amounts being mentioned for promised improvements for services and infrastructure are just spin until it is actually done. That work has to be done. It is not just a matter of going and getting another report and another report to delay everything and put it in the budget over three or four years so that it can be reannounced every three or four years. Governments have to get on with the job. At the end of the day, all this government seems to be doing is putting funding over three or four budgets and initiatives are announced again and again. People ask me, ‘How many times has the government announced this?’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073079"></A>
What can Hervey Bay look forward to from this year’s budget? Last year we were promised a $4.3 million pathology service at Hervey Bay Hospital. This year we have been promised exactly the same project, worth $3.8 million. The project is still there and the government is still announcing it, so I hope it happens this year because we desperately need it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073081"></A>
I have to hand it to the main roads department, because at least it is doing some planning for the future. With regard to the two intersections at Scrub Hill Road and Burrum Heads-Hervey Bay road, one of the most dangerous corners in the electorate, there is $1 million to do the planning for that upgrade and another $1 million for the Arawang-Maryborough-Hervey Bay intersection, another one of the most dangerous intersections. There have been some really nasty accidents at that intersection, and hopefully we can get money in future budgets to improve it--and close future budgets--because somebody will get killed there shortly. It was nearly me at one stage. On that intersection I had the closest shave I ever want to have. In terms of increased taxes for registration compared to road spending, it does not seem to correlate. Why is the amount of money being spent on our road system decreasing?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080633"></A>
I turn now to the police. Hervey Bay needs about 20 police officers urgently--that is, first-response police officers. We need the government to stop hiding behind the shifty reports of the police officer numbers and come clean as to how many first-response police officers are lacking throughout Queensland. I will say that again: we need first-response police officers on the streets. I am talking about police officers who work night shift and who also go out to emergency call-outs, risking their lives and limbs to protect our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080634"></A>
I thank the government for the 203 new police officers in this budget, but I just hope that Hervey Bay gets a fair number of those police officers to boost its police to population ratio compared to the ratio in other areas. Currently, the police to population ratio in Hervey Bay is one for every 1,545 people. That ratio is based on an estimated population as at 30 June 2009. When we see that the state average police to population ratio is one for 427, we can see that Hervey Bay is in desperate need of more police.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is all we have at Hervey Bay. I understand that the area comes within the Maryborough district, but the police to population ratio for the Maryborough district is one for every 570, which is very much under the number of police officers the area should have. So these areas should be given the number of police officers that they really need. If there are more than so many people in the watch-house, that means one more police officer who is not patrolling the streets at night. Some of the families in my area are concerned about their loved ones going out there by themselves. We have to look after the police while they are doing their job. But with all of these new gun laws, how many more police officers are going to be taken off the streets? There will be more paperwork for the police officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080639"></A>
A report by the National Stroke Foundation highlighted the fact that the Hervey Bay Hospital urgently needs a stroke unit, which is an issue that I have raised with the minister. Although the minister has acknowledged the need, I am waiting to hear when we can possibly start work on such an initiative. Hervey Bay Hospital certainly needs one. The whole Fraser Coast needs renal units and dialysis machines. People from Hervey Bay travel as far as Brisbane, Nambour and even Gympie three times a week to undergo dialysis. You cannot expect people to travel for about three or four hours, stay on the dialysis machine for five hours, and then turn around and drive back home again. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1080641"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thanks, Betty. There is a real need for that service on the Fraser Coast. Hervey Bay Hospital also needs a doctor specialising in diabetes. The doctor who was based at Hervey Bay Hospital for that reason retired and he has not been replaced. So this is not an extra cost; it is just to replace the doctor who was there at Hervey Bay Hospital. Also, Hervey Bay does not have any services for cataracts. To give members an example, a very special lady who does a tremendous amount of community work in the area cannot get a cataract operation in Hervey Bay which, in this day and age, is quite disappointing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080642"></A>
Education is one of my pet projects in Hervey Bay. During the last election campaign the LNP promised a new high school. The Premier said that for $18 million all you would get was a toilet block. I have always remembered that comment. She must have known what was coming with the ‘Gillard memorial halls’--the cost of some of them and what the schools are getting for the dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080643"></A>
I asked a question on notice to the Minister for Education, Geoff Wilson. I think the minister should practise what he preaches when he talks about population growth and sustainability and look at the growth of Hervey Bay. I can assure him that a couple of schools are needed in Hervey Bay well within the next 20 years. I was told in writing that Hervey Bay, whose population is going to double, does not need another high school for the next 20 years. Urangan State High School is at 100 per cent capacity, with about 1,700 children there. There is also the Hervey Bay State High School and Xavier Catholic College, which started some seven years ago and today it is at full capacity. According to this government, we do not need another high school in Hervey Bay for another 20 years. I cannot understand that. I cannot understand why we are not even planning for a new high school. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Xavier College is a school that goes from year 1 to year 12. Another issue that concerns me is the cancellation of the GAP program throughout the schools in Hervey Bay. This program picks up the kids who are exhibiting dysfunctional behaviour and tries to get the children back into the classroom. We do not want those children on the streets; we want them back in our school system. We want to be able to give our children an education. It is the same situation with the SSS program at the primary school. The funding has run out. I would like to know what is going to happen in the future with that program, because it is needed desperately. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Hundreds and thousands of tourists go there every year. And don’t tell me that we do not take any money out of our tourist industry in Queensland. It is one of the biggest industries we have. If you travel around and look at tourist resorts in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, you will see certain things. Members should look at what has happened at the Katherine Gorge. The Fraser Island World Heritage listed site is one of the only sites around the place that does not have an interpretative centre. How important is this? What does Katherine Gorge have? It has an interpretative centre. The rangers are there to help people. When you come back to Lawn Hill you can see the difference. That is the difference with Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

This government promised $6 million for the Eurong sewage treatment plant but, with the amalgamation of councils, what did it do? It took that money away. The government took away about $14 million in grants from the Fraser Coast Regional Council. Some of those projects were already started, but those grants were taken away. I am sure the same has happened right throughout Queensland, especially with those grants to local governments. Now, those local governments have to put up their rates to meet the demands of the people because the grants were taken away from them. </Hansard-Body>

In summing up, what has this budget really given? It has not given very much. I just hope that the cost of electricity does not go up the same as it has done over the past 12 months. I hope that the cost of registration does not go up the same as it did last year. Under this government, petrol has gone up by 9.1c per litre. How much more is it going to go up in the next 12 months? </Hansard-Body>

Hervey Bay has a large number of pensioners. Some of those pensioners are really struggling, especially when one of them ends up in a high-care unit and the other is left renting a house. Those pensioners find it very difficult. They are the people who really need a lot of help and, when you look around, there is not very much help. I see this happening all the time to those people. </Hansard-Body>

We have to make sure that we take care of the elderly and the disabled. For the last 10 years there has been the situation of not committing to the budget in relation to disability services. As stated in the shadow minister’s media release, we need more disability housing and more crisis housing. Those opposite have not spent it all. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will not worry about debt here tonight. My colleagues have spoken about debt. I will continue to speak about the things that are missing in Hervey Bay. We need future planning to make sure that we meet the needs of a growing Queensland. There are 100,000 people coming into this state every year. There has to be planning in place to meet the needs of the people coming to this state as well as those who are already here. This government has not done that planning in the past and that is why we have such a huge debt. Infrastructure should have been put in place years ago. I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. </Hansard-Body>

 (Mulgrave--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.10 pm): It has long been said that regional members of parliament from across the political spectrum sometimes need to yell a little louder to be heard. Well, the Premier and the Treasurer have listened. The 2010-11 state budget delivers for regional Queensland and for the Far North. More than 57 per cent of our record-breaking building program is to areas outside South-East Queensland, with over $990 million being spent across our region. This year the capital spend per person in Far North Queensland is $3,591, above that of $3,588 in Brisbane, Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. We are investing more than $1.3 billion in road projects outside the south-east corner and the government’s mini-stimulus package for the housing construction industry--the Regional First Home Buyers increase to $11,000--will also provide a boost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086459"></A>
One of the defining characteristics of the Queensland economy is that no two regions are the same. The impact of the global financial crisis has not been uniform across the state. There is no doubt that the Far North has done it tougher than most in recent times. Employment in the Cairns area declined, seeing our region record the sharpest increase in the unemployment rate in the year. Last year, along with elected representatives from the local, state and federal level, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Advance Cairns, the Cairns Chamber of Commerce and Tourism Tropical North Queensland on the need to secure a new deal for the Far North. The response from the Bligh government was the Cairns Economic Future plan, a $116 million package for our region designed to jump-start the economy. Several of these initiatives have been delivered in this budget. There is a lot to be said for the business community and elected representatives working together. We need to remember that great things for our region can be achieved by doing so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086460"></A>
Along with the members for Cairns, Barron River and Cook, I took our case to the Premier and the Treasurer. I sincerely thank them for listening and recognising that our region needed special consideration due to the tough circumstances. It is clear that while our local tourism industry must continue to be supported, we cannot continue to rely on it to deliver. We must build on areas of success, such as education, and continue to develop our tropical expertise. We need to continue to make linkages with Papua New Guinea and we need genuine regional approaches to investment, tendering and training to secure outcomes for the Far North. Despite a two per cent fall last month, the Far North still faces an unemployment level well above the state average and there is still more to be done. One of the highlights of this budget for our region is the firm commitment from the state government to be an equal partner with Cairns Regional Council and the federal government to develop the Cairns Cultural Precinct in Far North Queensland. The state budget makes a $42.5 million contribution to the project consisting of a transfer of the state owned port land valued at $40 million and $2.5 million as a one-third contribution of funding for detailed planning of the project. Of the project, chairman of Advance Cairns Russell Beer said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086461"></A>
It will provide a much needed boost to the region’s economy in these troubled times by creating immediate and ongoing jobs. This will be a transformational project for our region. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086462"></A>
This is an important step towards diversifying the region’s economic base. It will provide a people’s meeting place, fulfilling the vision of a waterfront precinct that our city has held for many years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086463"></A>
The cultural precinct will be a multi-purpose facility. It will have a practical component that builds on our strengths in the local economy, adding exhibition space to increase our ability to attract convention delegates in greater numbers than our current capacity allows. Maybe we will see headline Australian bands like AC/DC or international artists such as U2 or Pink not only visit Port Douglas for a holiday but hold a major concert in Cairns as well. The Bligh Labor government has committed to this project for the long-term benefit of our region and I trust that the federal government will join with us and make it a reality. </Hansard-Body>

LOCAL JOBS LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR RECOVERY</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086467"></A>
In the Mulgrave electorate, there are more than $80 million ($80,909,400) worth of initiatives allocated in this year’s budget. And this doesn’t include those other budget initiatives that are of regional significance such as the Cairns Cultural Precinct, and other projects that benefit workers and their families in Mulgrave.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086468"></A>
This figure is made up of many small parts, but every little bit counts with the current economic situation being what it is.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086469"></A>
Funding has been allocated in this year’s Budget to build and repair social housing, upgrade level crossings and spruce up local schools in Mulgrave, creating jobs and building on the foundations for economic recovery. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086470"></A>
My old primary school, Gordonvale State School, will see funding of $28,000 allocated for maintenance work. Science labs at Babinda State School will be renewed and more than $1.1 million has been allocated to refresh classrooms at Hambledon and Yarrabah state schools.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086471"></A>
As part of the largest investment in social housing since the Chifley era, almost $10 million has been allocated for projects in Mulgrave including $3.4 million to complete the construction of 20 single bedroom dwellings at Edmonton.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086472"></A>
The remaining $8 million towards the construction of a replacement Jubilee Bridge brings the State’s contribution to $14 million. On this basis, Cassowary Coast Regional Council has now given the project the green light and it’s expected to generate up to 140 jobs in the region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086473"></A>
More than three-quarters of a million dollars ($775,000) will also be provided this year to complete the $10 million project to upgrade level crossings between Farleigh and Garradunga. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086474"></A>
In terms of community safety, this year’s budget fulfils an election commitment with $1.9 million to construct a replacement ambulance station at Gordonvale which, after community consultation last year, will be co-located at the Gordonvale Memorial Hospital. It’s anticipated that construction will start before the end of 2010 and the station completed by the middle of 2011.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086475"></A>
I’m pleased to see $26.7 million in subsidies allocated to Cassowary Coast Regional Council in order to upgrade the sewerage treatment plant, as part of the $40.4 million previously announced as part of the Cairns Economic Future plan. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086476"></A>
I also welcome confirmation of $5.7 million to assist Cassowary Coast Regional Council with the upgrade of the Innisfail water treatment plant. The upgrade will help Council ensure it has the infrastructure necessary to protect the Great Barrier Reef and meet the demands of future growth. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086477"></A>
Also on the Cassowary Coast, I’m sure that the Member for Hinchinbrook joins with me in welcoming the allocation of $226,000 for a proposed commercial fishing facility at Mourilyan Harbour--an important port for the Far North’s commercial fishing industry. I am meeting with representatives from Ports North next week to seek further information on this project but a go ahead for construction would mean jobs in the local economy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086478"></A>
Looking north, there’s plenty of good news in the budget for Cape York communities too, which in turn means good news for Cairns. More than $50 million to build new bridges, roads, police stations and educational facilities will provide job opportunities for Cairns-based tradespeople.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086479"></A>
All of these projects will play a significant role in creating jobs and helping support the Far North’s economic recovery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

INDUSTRIAL LAND AND FUTURE EMPLOYMENT HUBS</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086481"></A>
This year the Department of Infrastructure and Planning has completed the Far North Queensland Industrial Land Study and secured industrial land in Cairns through the Mount Peter Master Planning Project. And there’s also $1.4 million in the budget as a first step to increase the industrial land capacity in the region, with a total commitment of $8 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086482"></A>
This is good strategic planning and complements proposed private sector projects like the master-planned Edmonton Business and Industry Park. This project alone would reportedly create up to 4,000 jobs during the construction phase, plus a similar number ongoing, and provide a major catalyst for local employment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086483"></A>
I’ve been a strong advocate for the Edmonton Business and Industry Park and I know there is general support for it within Government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086484"></A>
But this shovel-ready project is a good example of low-hanging fruit that is languishing on the vine. We need to find a way to fast track this project for the good of our entire Far North Queensland region and give a shot in the arm for investor confidence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

SKILLS AND TRAINING</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086486"></A>
Under the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program, $95.7 million has been allocated to the Far North for vocational education and training--including apprenticeships and traineeships--and $10.8 million to deliver new job creation programs and grow a skilled workforce</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086487"></A>
We’re also providing $5.14 Million to assist low skilled workers, those disadvantaged in the labour market and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy, and more than $1 million to deliver training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in regional and remote areas of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

ROADS AND TRANSPORT</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086489"></A>
I’ve already mentioned the $8 million commitment to the construction of a new Jubilee Bridge in Innisfail, but the other big ticket roads item in the budget for Mulgrave relates to the Bruce Highway Upgrade Project. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086490"></A>
The first $20 Million in federal funding has been allocated for overpasses between Sheehy Road and Ray Jones Drive, with a total federal government contribution of $150 Million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086491"></A>
When door knocking during the 2009 election campaign, I was left in no doubt that residents in the southern corridor of Cairns wanted to see action on the Bruce Highway. In my subsequent discussions at street stalls and constituent meetings I have no reason to believe that the general public support for upgrading the existing transport corridor has diminished.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086492"></A>
Proponents of a second corridor option via East Trinity know that such an option would provide no benefit to those people living north of Wrights Creek as they would not have direct access to the second corridor. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086493"></A>
It is people living in White Rock, Mount Sheridan, Bentley Park and Edmonton who make up more than two thirds of total traffic and are bearing the brunt of traffic congestion problems. A second corridor would not alleviate this congestion so the existing corridor would still need to be upgraded. I’m proud to be working in partnership with Federal Member for Leichhardt Jim Turnour on this project of regional significance.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086494"></A>
There are also plenty of smaller roads related projects to be delivered between Cairns and Innisfail, as well as over to Yarrabah that are funded by this budget. Packaged together, they are worth almost $1 million. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086495"></A>
Use of public transport in our region is also on the rise. In 2009, more than 3.5 million bus trips were made in Cairns--the same as the number of passengers through the Cairns International Airport over the same period. This budget subsidises the cost of all of the public transport services provided by Marlin Coast Sunbus in the Cairns region ($7,867,913) and by TransNorth to Innisfail and surrounding areas ($239,142).</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086496"></A>
For those people who continue to own and maintain a car, our changes to CTP insurance will save money. Preventing motor dealers from receiving commissions will reduce costs by around $24. This may seem like a small amount to some, but people doing it tough know that every little bit counts.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

HEALTH</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086498"></A>
Most people would be aware that the Cairns Base Hospital is undergoing a $446.3 million redevelopment to be completed by 2014. This budget provides the next $80 million of that project, as well as $5.6 million to complete the $12.7 million Cairns Central Community Health Centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086499"></A>
But the Cairns Base hospital site is constrained and is expected to run out of room in coming years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086500"></A>
The location of future health facilities in the region was one of my top priorities at the last election and I made it clear that Labor will also invest in a major health facility in the southern suburbs of Cairns. A short-listing process for potential sites is well advanced, with confidential negotiations underway.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086501"></A>
I’m very keen for a decision on this issue as I know it will put many people’s mind at rest and provide some certainty that the southern suburbs are not being forgotten when it comes to the future health needs of our region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086502"></A>
It’s important that the location can be easily accessed by as many residents as possible, which means aligning site selection with planning for the Bruce Highway upgrade and Cairns Transit Network projects.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086503"></A>
The opportunity also exists for a private health facility to be constructed to complement the government’s plans. Add into the mix the GP Super Clinic near Sugarworld and the future health picture for the southern corridor looks bright.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086504"></A>
In last year’s budget, we secured the final $15.77 million to complete the primary health care facility at Yarrabah. I was pleased to recently take a walk through and was most impressed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086505"></A>
Last week, I joined the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health Paul Lucas to meet with representatives from Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. Gurriny will be colocated with Queensland Health in this facility and are funded in this year’s budget to the tune of $198,000 to provide Clinical Services and Health </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086506"></A>
While there are still some staff transitional issues to work through, Gurriny is a shining example of how community controlled health initiatives can work and improve the lives of aboriginal people. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086507"></A>
It’s also worth noting that Queensland Health recognises that ‘who’ delivers the health service can make a real difference. Having a female doctor available usually sees an enormous influx of female community members accessing health services. And of course it’s also important to see indigenous health workers in key roles, not only to provide culturally sensitive health care, but to provide good role models for young people in the community to look up to.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I’m proud of this budget which delivers on Labor’s promise to create more jobs, sooner. It not only focuses on regional Queensland, but has a strong emphasis on continuing to deliver support services to some of the most vulnerable people in our region. It is a budget for the times.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086510"></A>
We took the tough decisions as a government to ensure we could continue to see jobs growth, but also to support those in our community who needed our help.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086511"></A>
We all know that financial pressures can lead to an increase in domestic violence. This budget includes funding of $330,202 towards an accommodation and support service for women and children escaping domestic and family violence, with a total State Government contribution of $990,606.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086512"></A>
Young people at risk of homelessness will be able to access $359,987 in counselling and support services with a total State Government contribution of $1.08 Million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086513"></A>
Over half a million dollars will be spent to provide early intervention support for children with autism and their families. Younger people with disabilities will be supported to exit or be diverted from entering aged care facilities with funding of $1.43 million. And there’s more than half a million in Home and Community Care (HACC) funding to support communities in Innisfail and Babinda.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086514"></A>
The Queensland Government is committed to helping ease cost of living pressures on working families, pensioners and Queenslanders doing it tough. Working families are supported, with $15,525 made available to increase coordinator hours and enhance program preparation for Outside School Hours Care services at the Innisfail PCYC, Good Counsel Primary School, and St Michael’s Gordonvale.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

There are already several initiatives to assist with rising electricity prices, particularly for pensioners. We’ve already increased the rebate available to $190 per year, and from 1 July this year it will increase to around $216.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086516"></A>
I wanted to particularly mention a new Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Commission Scheme that will provide a rebate to assist with the electricity costs for eligible concession card holders with a medical condition who have a dependence on air-conditioning to regulate body temperature, such as those suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086517"></A>
Queensland Council of Social Services (QCOSS) President Karyn Walsh welcomed the announcement and said heat-sensitive patients, most on low incomes, would have been devastated by the expected price rise on 1 July unless something was done.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1086518"></A>

THE EARLY YEARS ARE IMPORTANT</Hansard-Bold>

We know that access to quality early childhood programs are critical in order to help give our kids a flying start in life. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086521"></A>
This year residents in Mulgrave will benefit from new kindergarten services as part of the government’s pilot program to subsidise long-day-care centres.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086522"></A>
The ABC Learning Centre at Tamarind Gardens will receive $22,725 to offer kindergarten programs taught by qualified teachers as part of the government’s commitment to universal access--at a total cost of $68,175. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086523"></A>
Having a kindergarten program combined with the convenience of long day care will be great for working parents who want their children to access quality early education. I know the extra services will be welcomed by parents in this fast-growing area</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086524"></A>
The budget papers also flag the construction of an early years centre in the Cairns region to commence services in 2011. The centre would provide integrated early childhood education and care, family support and child and family health services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086525"></A>
Population growth will continue strongly, growth will fuel demand for early childhood education, child-care, and other services--including more kindergartens. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086526"></A>
I’ll certainly be presenting a strong case to have this Early Years Centre considered for the growing southern corridor, and for us to get our fair share of the accelerated kindergarten program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

ECONOMIC STRATEGIES ARE POLES APART</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086528"></A>
The Opposition Leader’s response to the budget was light on detail to say the least. As expected, it was a case of ‘Magic Pudding’ economics. The LNP has no plan and no solutions--and certainly no income stream to speak of. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086529"></A>
During the budget debate I’ve heard several Liberal-National MPs who on the one hand opposed our capital program, but proudly boasted about the projects that were being built in their electorates. Not satisfied, they continue to ask for more and more yet are unable or unwilling to see that initiatives cost money. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086530"></A>
Again they take the path of least political resistance, and again demonstrate their duplicity. Their lack of a plan takes us further away from regaining a AAA credit rating, not closer.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086531"></A>
How will they pay for their promises, what they cost, where will the money come from, what taxes will they raise and what programs would they cut? In order to deliver on any of their promises, the LNP would need to do one of two things.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086532"></A>
They’d need to put in a place a capital works freeze and in the process nobble thousands of hard working men and women who’ve kept their jobs or gained employment as a result of Labor’s building program. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Make no mistake, the only thing the LNP stands for is job cuts. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086535"></A>
Labor understands that behind these jobs are working families and the last thing Queenslanders need in tough times is to lose the dignity of work and the ability to put food on the table for their family. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

ASSET SALES STILL NEEDED</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086537"></A>
We’re in a better position than forecast last year, and while we are recovering, the sale of the five commercial businesses is still needed in order for us to attain our goal to return to a AAA credit rating. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086538"></A>
The assets for sale would require a considerable injection of funds for upgrade and maintenance in future years. That is money that will need to be borrowed, that cannot be invested in infrastructure to keep pace with state population growing by 2,000 people a week. We need more, not less. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086539"></A>
Schools, roads, hospitals, ambulance, police and fire stations will be the legacy of this government’s preparedness to make the hard decisions during tough times. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086540"></A>
Unlike the Opposition, we have a plan and we’ve stuck to that plan. It’s a responsible economic strategy that is protecting jobs and building the infrastructure we need for a stronger future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

CONCLUSION</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086542"></A>
Job figures released this week show that Queensland has generated jobs for the tenth month in a row with 8,800 new jobs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086543"></A>
Our jobs target started out last year at 100,000 and today stands at 50,700. Even in the worst of economic times we are half way towards the commitment we gave at the last election.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086544"></A>
Queenslanders were promised a strong economic plan for the future and this Budget delivered on that promise.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Hon. JC SPENCE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Sunnybank--ALP) (6.13 pm): It is a great honour to represent the people of the Sunnybank electorate in this parliament. There are lots of reasons for the suburbs in the Sunnybank electorate being special. I will share one of them with you. I am told that a river of positive chi energy flows through it. Feng Shui Master, Tom Lo, says that Sunnybank and the suburbs that surround it are geographically positioned roughly at the point, relative to the rest of Brisbane, of the dragon’s heart. The heart is very strong because it is pumping the blood. It has got a lot of good energy. If you live near it you will have prosperity and harmony. If you have positive energy, you will live a longer and happier life. And if this is not enough, the words ‘sunny’ and ‘bank’ bring added luck simply due to the references to energy and money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086547"></A>
My electorate is the multicultural heart of Queensland. At Sunnybank State High School, 80 per cent of the students have English as their second language and many other schools in my electorate are similarly multicultural. Besides having some of the best shopping precincts and restaurants in the state, we also have the large light industrial precinct at Acacia Ridge, the Archerfield Airport, our own hospital--the QEII--the state’s forensic and DNA facility at Coopers Plains, our own university--the Griffith University--and the largest Trade TAFE College in Queensland--SkillsTech at Acacia Ridge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086548"></A>
This budget continues our government’s commitment to skills and training. Not only does Queensland have the lowest payroll tax rate in Queensland, we offer a payroll exemption for apprentices and trainees. Since my election to represent the Acacia Ridge area, I have had the opportunity to have a comprehensive look around the entire campus of our TAFE SkillsTech. I commend the leadership of Kay Giles, institute director, Miguel Diaz, business development director, and Allan Perry, manager of educational infrastructure. It is very refreshing to witness the enthusiasm of these officers and their well-placed pride in their new campus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086549"></A>
Every building at this college is environmentally sustainable. For example, rainwater is gathered from the extensive roof system into large tanks. The building design of the new $20 million electrical, refrigeration and air-conditioning training facility incorporates 90 solar panels putting power back into the grid. This purpose-built facility covers 8,000 square metres and provides flexible workshops and specialised education spaces and is part of the SkillsTech building program commitment worth more than $200 million. The Acacia Ridge SkillsTech has a student population of 7,454 students, 153 overseas students and 4,505 apprentices supported by 135 teachers and 234 other support staff. It offers centralised training in construction, plumbing, furnishing, foundry, electrical, refrigeration, painting and decorating, and in the near future will add to these trades with the wet trades which will move to the campus from the Yeronga site. Money spent on this facility is vital to ensure the future of apprenticeships and trades in Queensland. I request leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1086550"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086551"></A>
The budget also includes funding for renewal of buildings for every state school in my electorate. In partnership with the federal government, we are investing in education of children and adults.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086552"></A>
I am a frequent visitor at all of my schools and I recently spent a day acting as Principal of Sunnybank State High School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086553"></A>
My duties as the temporary principal included meeting student leaders, facilitating a student forum to discuss the School Wide Positive Behaviour program, running a school assembly, being on playground duty, participating in classroom activities and attending a staff meeting at the end of the day.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086554"></A>
The day gave me the opportunity to see what goes on behind the scenes in running a school in 2010, including administration and interaction with students and parents. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086555"></A>
As a former high school teacher I thoroughly enjoyed walking in the shoes of Principal Diane Hicks during a regular school day, gaining an insight into the daily operations of the school and seeing the changes that have occurred since my own teaching days.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086556"></A>
I have 17 schools in my electorate and I would like to talk about the unique qualities of each one of them but time constraints prevent me. With new halls, libraries, science blocks, classrooms and tuckshops our schools are this year getting facilities they would only have ever dreamed about before the federal government stimulus money.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086557"></A>
I invite anyone to go and talk to the Principal of Watson Road State School to find out what the new facilities mean to that school. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086558"></A>
Never before has a government invested so much into upgrading our schools and I know the teachers and students are very excited by their new facilities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086559"></A>
Given the pace of change in the modern world, one of the challenges of teaching is keeping abreast of new information technology and this requires modern up-to-date classrooms. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086560"></A>
One of the great commentators of our time, Thomas Friedman said “Never before in the history of the planet have so many people on their own had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many people.” </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086561"></A>
The internet has given everyone access to information. My 76 year old friend is doing a Certificate in IT at our local TAFE. Skills Tech has had a 54 year old apprentice. The Police Service has sworn in a new officer who was 49 years of age. It is likely that this generation will change their careers many times during their lifetimes, so learning will be life-long.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086562"></A>
While it is important to educate the young and I firmly believe that a good education is one of the most important gifts we can give our children, it is increasingly important that people at all stages of life are provided with the opportunity of getting additional education. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086563"></A>
Mr Speaker, in my spare time I am ploughing my way through a Masters degree in Commerce and it is very useful to study the issues and challenges that beset the modern business world.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086564"></A>
I am also finding out how expensive it is to access this higher education, so I am happy that our TAFE colleges remain affordable and the Higher Education Loan Program allows everyone access to higher education.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086565"></A>
Mr Speaker, as the Treasurer informed us in his budget speech, five years ago our health budget was $5 billion but this year it is $9.99 billion. It has doubled in five years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086566"></A>
Anyone who visits Queensland’s major public hospitals, the Princess Alexandra, the Royal Brisbane or the Mater cannot fail to notice that today they are modern and efficient and welcoming.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086567"></A>
Our own QEII hospital has benefited from this increased health budget in recent years. Now every floor of the QEII is being used for patients. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086568"></A>
This budget provides money for the continued upgrades of the emergency department to create 11 fast track bays and additional short stay capacity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086569"></A>
As a local member of parliament, I make regular visits to the QEII in order to inform myself of the issues confronting doctors, nurses and patients. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086570"></A>
I acknowledge the fine work of hospital directors, Doctors David Evans and Mike Kerin and their dedicated staff. They are assisted by an enthusiastic hospital auxiliary who every day staff the canteen and sell raffle tickets to raise money for the hospital.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086571"></A>
One volunteer deserves special mention--Stan Bellas nicknamed “Mr QEII”. He is a volunteer gardener and raffle seller extraordinaire at the hospital. He is well loved for his wonderful personality and the relationships he has built as well as the money he raises. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086572"></A>
People are quick to criticise any failings of our health service but the QEII performs more than 5,300 operations each year and I hear lots of praise about the hospital from people who have been patients there. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086573"></A>
A new initiative of the hospital was the opening of a new breast screening service at Upper Mt Gravatt. Based in The Village Shopping Centre, it is intended to be a quick accessible place for people to get breast screening done.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086574"></A>
Mr Speaker, I will continue to lobby the Health Minister for an upgrade of QEII’s intensive care unit.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086575"></A>
This unit is in need of additional space and it needs refurbishment. The people who staff this unit are a particularly dedicated team who work well above capacity in a very cramped space. We are indeed fortunate to have Dr Malcolm Wright who has impressive experience and qualifications in his field running this unit.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086576"></A>
The pharmaceutical area of the hospital is operating out of a small area which has not increased as the hospital has expanded its beds and capacity. I strongly encourage that this area be factored into redevelopment plans. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086577"></A>
This budget contains $100 million for the expansion of existing Queensland Health research facilities at Kessels Road at Coopers Plains to create a science centre of excellence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086578"></A>
Scientists from Queensland Health, the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Queensland Primary Industries and Fisheries and CSIRO will join together to create a vibrant knowledge centre for health and food. In the next few months 147 staff will be moving in.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086579"></A>
The precinct will focus on the creation of ‘super’ foods to combat disorders like diabetes and degenerative eye diseases and enhance animal health, biosecurity and food integrity by expanding the range of new methods to protect against emerging and exotic diseases and contaminants in food. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086580"></A>
The processing, packaging and distribution of foods will be investigated to improve waste minimisation or the survival of mud crabs to market and flavour preservation. New varieties of strawberries will be tested by trained panels and consumers for flavour and eating qualities. Beef, pork, eggs and honey will be tested to find accurate methods of protecting them from emerging and exotic diseases. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086581"></A>
Acacia Ridge is home to one of Queensland’s largest railway freight yards, Brisbane’s International Speedway, one of Brisbane’s few ice-skating rinks and Archerfield Airport. This airport has a wonderful history as it was once Brisbane’s main airport and the home of Qantas, Ansett and TAA. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086582"></A>
The airport is also home to God’s Little Acre. The historic God’s Acre Cemetery at Archerfield celebrated its 150th birthday along with Queensland in October last year. The first burial on this site took place in 1859 in what was then New South Wales. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086583"></A>
This little cemetery is truly a treasure on the southside of Brisbane. It has the graves of our earliest settlers and is a fantastic resource of local history, situated in Archerfield adjacent to the airport.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086584"></A>
It has been lovingly looked after by a voluntary committee headed by Robin Barke and Genise Benz.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086585"></A>
Recently disadvantaged jobseekers funded by a state government programme helped them restore the graves and the original picket fence and erect shelters, seating and signage. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086586"></A>
Acacia Ridge is the largest transport and industrial hub on Brisbane’s southside. It is also home to some of Queensland’s best entrepreneurs. Let me give a few examples. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086587"></A>
QLM is a family run label making company. It employs 51 people and it is expanding. I was very honoured to recently declare a new Swiss-made printing press up and running. This company has also recently branched out to Asia with the purchase of a printing company in Malaysia. It is one of the top 400 Queensland companies providing employment and a world-class product to its clients.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086588"></A>
Another success story is Jaws Buckets. This Queensland business supplying the mining, construction, earthmoving, quarrying and materials handling industries was established in Brisbane in 1970 and has grown to become Australia’s largest dedicated bucket and attachment manufacturer. A family owned and operated business with over 160 highly skilled personnel and an undercover factory space of over 14,000 square metres they now export to over 16 countries.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086589"></A>
Jaws are proud to have independently partnered with a number of local high schools for school based apprentices. The apprenticeships provide skills that are vital to the future of the manufacturing industry such as machining, boiler-making, engineering and sales.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086590"></A>
It is businesses such as these based in the Sunnybank electorate that add value to the State of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086591"></A>
There are many road projects funded in this budget that will benefit the people of my electorate. Close to my heart is the $10 million upgrade of the intersection of Padstow and Logan Roads. I use this intersection each day and I know how frustrating the waiting times are. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086592"></A>
The budget also has funding for paving and sealing work on Beaudesert Road and concept planning on Beaudesert Road between Granard Road and the Logan Motorway.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086593"></A>
I am very pleased to be able to say that work is well underway to fix up one of the Sunnybank electorate’s main peak hour traffic congestion hotspots, the Mains Road/Kessels Road intersection.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086594"></A>
Planning for the $300 million Main Roads and Kessels Road Intersection Upgrade project commenced in 2006 with solid community consultation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086595"></A>
A recent injection of funding from the federal budget means that the project team are now in a position to finalise the design and to procure design and construction contractors. I want to acknowledge the fact that it was the Rudd Government and our local Member for Moreton, Graham Perrett who found the money for this project. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086596"></A>
After years of hollow promises from the former Member for Moreton who made this intersection one of his signature issues but achieved nothing, it is good to see the project up and running. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086597"></A>
Actual construction of the overpass project is set to start in January 2012. I am advised that completion of works will be in 2014.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086598"></A>
As a bike rider, I am delighted to say that a feature of the project is for new on-road cycle provisions and 2.5 metre wide shared paths for pedestrians and cyclists.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086599"></A>
Also factored into the project are bus priority facilities on Mains Road in both directions. This will also greatly assist in traffic flow. This project caters for approximately 20 years of traffic growth from the day of opening.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086600"></A>
Whilst some businesses along Kessels Road, particularly those in close proximity to the underpass have had some land acquisition, this has allowed for the project when completed to have two access lanes each way along Kessels Road next to the underpass and two at-grade turn lanes from Kessels Road onto Mains Road. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086601"></A>
I am very aware that many people are finding it difficult to pay their bills at the moment. Rates, electricity, car registration and petrol to name just a few costs of living that have gone up. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086602"></A>
The demand for Public Housing is growing and every week I meet people who are doing it tough to make ends meet. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086603"></A>
We have some great churches, neighbourhood centres and organisations like Lifeline, the Red Cross and the Sunnybank RSL to give people a helping hand. Our Rotary and Lions Clubs also contribute to good causes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086604"></A>
The state government provides funding to some of these organisations. I was very pleased in recent years to obtain funds for the RSL to help upgrade their hall and build a new monument and it is now a very attractive community facility. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086605"></A>
I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous community outreach members of our RSL are engaged in. Similarly the good work of the Sunnybank Red Cross is helping many local families. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086606"></A>
At the end of the day it is the government’s obligation to make sure that all of its citizens have a decent quality of life and the opportunity to work, recreate and build families. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086607"></A>
This budget framed in tough economic times fulfils the agenda of a Labor Government to provide assistance to the most needy, seniors, the disabled and provide assistance to help with the cost of living for working families. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086608"></A>
We’ve abolished mortgage duty and stamp duty for first homebuyers of homes up to $500,000 and first homebuyers buying vacant land up to $250,000. To help people with their power bills, we will continue our solar hot water rebate and the solar bonus scheme.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086609"></A>
This budget continues to give as many concessions to Seniors as the economy can afford. Pensioners continue to enjoy a full 50% discount on the car registration: a concession that this year is worth $90 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086610"></A>
The half price travel for pensioners and students using buses, trains and ferries remains, as does the discount taxi travel for people with a disability. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086611"></A>
This year’s budget increases the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors from $190 to $216 per household at a cost of over $50 million over the next four years. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086612"></A>
As well there will be up to $100.00 cash back for eligible pensioners on their water bills from July this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086613"></A>
We are introducing a new subsidy program to assist those vulnerable Queenslanders whose medical condition requires the extra use of air conditioners, such as sufferers of multiple sclerosis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086614"></A>
We are also introducing a new tax exemption measure to assist Queenslanders with a disability, by excluding homes purchased through a disability trust from stamp duty.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086615"></A>
In total, this budget provides around $1.3 billion worth of concessions to Queenslanders in need.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086616"></A>
Each year I distribute my budget speech to the electorate. I don’t know how well read it is but for people this year who have taken the time to get to the end of this one, this year I invite you to provide me with feedback via email: sunnybank@parliament.qld.gov.au or phone 3219 6974. My electorate office is now located at Suite 3, 309 Mains Road, Sunnybank and I am happy to have meetings with people there or at parliament. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086617"></A>
As well I am doing constituency meetings every third Wednesday of the month at Acacia Ridge Community Centre, 21 Hanify Street from 1.30--2.30 pm and St David’s Neighbourhood Centre, 22 Rookwood Avenue, Coopers Plains from 3--4 pm.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086618"></A>
I have found in recent years that people are more frequently giving their views to representatives like myself and this is a positive direction for democracy and I welcome their input.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086619"></A>
I do not believe that governments are the fonts of all knowledge and lots of good ideas come from ordinary citizens. Indeed I have changed legislation as a result of these types of representations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086620"></A>
Mr Speaker in these challenging times, this year’s budget offers fair and achievable outcomes for the people of Queensland and particularly for the Sunnybank electorate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086621"></A>
I look forward to discussing our decision making with my constituents in the months ahead and particularly seeing our new initiatives come to fruition. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (6.17 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill brought to the House by the Treasurer and to provide an overview of the budget as it impacts on transport services across the state. At $7 billion in capital and operational expenditure, the Transport budget has seen substantial growth--up on the $6.3 billion appropriation last year. Transport is the third largest portfolio appropriation, reflecting the Bligh government’s commitment to developing sustainable communities, securing jobs and laying the foundations of a strong economic recovery. Public transport is at the heart of the government’s commitment to build sustainable communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086625"></A>
In developing its budget last year, the government made some very difficult economic decisions, embarking on a program of asset sales including three major transport government owned corporations. A year on, the government remains committed to that economic reform and while Queensland Rail, the Port of Brisbane and Abbot Point Coat Terminal are not set to be sold until this financial year, the existence of a clear fiscal strategy means that government can continue with its enormous program of infrastructure delivery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086720"></A>
As the Treasurer outlined in delivering the budget, the economic recovery remains tentative with households under a degree of financial strain, and the state budget remains tight with revenues still significantly down from levels forecast prior to the global financial crisis. In that constrained fiscal environment, the one major infrastructure project brought forward by the government this year is the Richlands to Springfield railway line, a $646 million project being brought forward two years for completion in 2013. The selection of that project above all others reflects the Bligh government’s commitment to draw population to the west and to build infrastructure to support it, avoiding the quality of life disaster of unchecked urban sprawl from Noosa to Coolangatta that would have happened if government had not firmly grasped the reins of planning control with the regional plan brought down in 2004.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086721"></A>
In the years 1981 to 2006, the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast both grew by 220 per cent. Brisbane, which had already reached its city limits through conventional suburban development, grew by 35 per cent and Ipswich, despite its capacity for growth and existing infrastructure, grew by only half. Over the next 25 years from 2006 to 2031, those growth trends are set to be reversed. The Gold and Sunshine coasts are expected to grow by 70 per cent, Brisbane by 23 per cent and Ipswich by 205 per cent. That change in trend is in part natural, reflecting the availability of land, but it is spurred by the regional plan and this government’s driving view that South-East Queensland can only grow sustainably if population is spread, if densities around some centres are increased as an antidote to unchecked urban sprawl and if a substantial shift is made from cars to public transport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086722"></A>
However, Springfield is by no means the government’s only public transport infrastructure commitment. Over the next year: $150 million will be spent extending the Eastern Busway from Buranda towards Main Avenue at Coorparoo; $197 million will be spent continuing construction of the Northern Busway from Enoggera Creek to Kedron; $35 million will be spent duplicating the railway line from Keperra to Ferny Grove and revamping the Ferny Grove station to include more parking and a bus interchange; $200 million will be spent on station renovation, which is the biggest upgrade of railway stations since services began in 1865; there is $219 million for Gold Coast Rapid Transit; $174 million will be spent building new trains through the current contract with Downer EDI in Maryborough; $61 million will be spent on cycling infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086724"></A>
The big challenge for a government though is not just the cost of delivering public transport infrastructure; it is the fact that, with an average subsidy of $3 for every $1 anyone pays in fare, the recurrent cost to government of providing quality public transport is immense. In the six years since South-East Queensland’s integrated public transport network, TransLink, was established, funding to run it has grown from $600 million to $1.38 billion, with an increase of 15 per cent in the last year alone. Over the same time fare revenue has grown from $180 million in 2004 to a projected $382 million this year. While the state Labor government has met the demands of growth, the only LNP administration in the state, that of Lord Mayor Campbell Newman at Brisbane City Hall, has failed miserably to do the same.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086725"></A>
Over the six years since TransLink was established, Brisbane City Council’s contribution to the funding of Brisbane Transport buses--the blue and yellow buses that everyone thinks the BCC pays for--has fallen from its historical 50-50 funding share with the state to today’s level of the BCC providing just 38 per cent. If Campbell Newman had matched the Bligh government’s funding for Brisbane buses, today there would be an extra $40 million for Brisbane buses. I note that today the Labor opposition at the BCC has indicated that, if elected, it will restore the 50-50 funding split, putting $40 million a year extra into Brisbane buses. I call for Lord Mayor Campbell Newman to man up on public transport, to match the state’s funding growth, to abandon--</Hansard-Body>

 The Lord Mayor should abandon the ridiculous claim that Brisbane bus crowding is somehow the result of a mysterious influx of freeloading out-of-towners and he should restore Brisbane’s historically proud commitment to public transport. Public transport is critical to Brisbane’s sustainable future, but all levels of government need to pull their weight. </Hansard-Body>

The transport budget has always been about connecting all parts of our vast and beautiful state, and this year is no exception. This year the budget includes $350 million for regional rail infrastructure; $156 million for subsidies for regional rail, bus and air subsidies, including $139 million for Traveltrain and subsidies for services like air and bus services to the most remote parts of western Queensland; $169 million will be provided for subsidies for school bus travels, again mainly in regional parts of the state; $34 million is provided for QConnect, the network of bus operators in the regional towns such as Sunbus which, with state subsidies, is currently rolling out new air-conditioned, low-floor buses in Townsville, Cairns and Rockhampton. There is also a provision of $15 million for the Taxi Subsidy Scheme, which provides discounted taxi travel for eligible people, mainly the aged and disabled who have serious mobility problems meaning that, without taxis, they simply could not get around.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086734"></A>
A substantial part of the Transport task is conducted through the government owned corporations. This year $3 billion is provided for capital expansion in GOCs to allow them to continue to facilitate economic development and trade. The major GOC projects include Queensland Rail’s Goonyella to Abbot Point expansion and the X50 expansion at the Port of Abbot Point. While government has taken the view that these purely commercial projects should, in a mature economy, be undertaken by the private sector rather than sitting on the state’s balance sheet, at the start of the financial year they remain state projects provided for through the budget process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086735"></A>
The budget provides $1.62 billion for the operation of the transport functions of the Department of Transport and Main Roads. That figure includes some of the functions I have already listed, such as school transport subsidies. It also provides for core departmental functions such as the transport inspectors who police heavy vehicles, taxis and compliance with transit lanes, the network of 66 customer service centres across the state, the development of road safety policy and campaigns and the Integrated Transport Planning Division, which undertake work such as planning new transport corridors. </Hansard-Body>

Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition stood in this place and delivered his budget reply. His contribution has been criticised quite rightly for failing to provide any semblance of an economic strategy, for failing to meet the first test of an opposition leader, for failing to provide an alternative. However, just as significantly, the Leader of the Opposition delivered his contribution without managing to utter the words ‘public transport’ once. A strong transport sector is critical to the state’s economy and, in a growing state, a strong public transport sector is utterly critical to our sustainability. Transport is literally the lifeblood of Queensland. This budget delivers substantial transport funding growth. It delivers major capital projects in the growing south-east. It delivers continued strong funding for regional public transport and school transport schemes, and it delivers billions of dollars in economic infrastructure to keep the state growing. This is a strong Transport budget. However, three full days after it was handed down we still do not know the alternative. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (6.27 pm): As one of nine children, for as long as I can remember it has been in my best interest to intently analyse budgets. It was an in-built survival mechanism that every member of the family naturally acquired in order to ensure they received their fair share, and the waste-not want-not approach was the order of the day. I will never forget watching the porridge pot closely, which my parents seemed to magically produce from oats and boiling water in less than five minutes. On special days we were even allowed to add some honey. A state budget is very similar to a porridge pot. The taxpayers contribute the ingredients to the government and the government sits on the bubbling cash until it has prioritised how it intends to redistribute those ingredients. The only problem, which is readily identified by the public at large, is that there are some continuing and significant spillages when that porridge is transported from the oventop to the kitchen table.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086741"></A>
Initiative 1: there is no question that the unicameral system we find ourselves in is one of the most fundamental reasons we are the only state in Australia with a AA credit rating. This financial ineptitude is not good enough and needs to be rectified to prevent our credit rating from slipping down a further notch. Upon the successful registration of the party’s name and constitution, the Queensland Party will be releasing to the public an innovative model for the reintroduction of the upper house to implement a real checkpoint of accountability. This model will be very different to that of the original model that was abolished in 1922, which consisted of a board of appointees that became somewhat obstructionist in nature and whose power base was significantly disproportionate to that of the Legislative Assembly. This model will not create an increase in the number of politicians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086775"></A>
Initiative 2: if we all collectively want to lead this state into an era of openness and accountability, then we must first reflect on our own internal practices. I remember when former Lord Mayor Jim Soorley presented a session with the Logan city councillors on one of our retreats and he told us, ‘Never forget that a fish rots from the head’. So, too, if a state’s finances go belly up, then we must all take a good hard look in the mirror and make sure that George Street is not itself rotting. I intentionally say ‘all’ because the success of the states affairs or otherwise lies on all our shoulders--a complacent opposition is equally at fault with an incompetent government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086776"></A>
To this end, the Queensland Party will propose to abolish the electorate allowances as we know them and replace them with a more accountable system so that elected representatives are equipped with the necessary tools required for the job. This would entail a leased vehicle, a mobile phone on a corporate package and a modest postage allowance for direct correspondence only which will eradicate the political propaganda distributed at taxpayers’ expense. This will create an environment where everything will be done aboveboard, and it will get rid of the grey areas and create a level playing field, because at the moment in some cases it can be barely enough for one MP and quite a lucrative side package for others.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086777"></A>
When it comes to abuse in political advertising at taxpayer expense, both sides of politics are guilty. Whether it is the ALP promoting the ‘myths and facts’ about asset sales or the LNP promoting a website the length of the alphabet that allows one to ‘email one’s concerns to them because they don’t know where they stand on asset sales’, it has quite clearly become a blatant abuse of the hard-earned dollars of the Queensland taxpayer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086778"></A>
Initiative 3: the Queensland Party will work with local councils across the state to ensure the dumping of rubbish becomes cost free within five years by using existing fees and charges to fund the technology required to turn waste into useful by-products. A successful example of this is the product called wood-plastic composite, which is a material lumber or timber made of recycled plastic and wood wastes. I table the make-up of what is referred to as the WPC.</Hansard-Body>

The ANZ bank has embarked on an innovative and ambitious recycling campaign titled ‘Reduce, Recycle and Redistribute’.

Where there is a will there is a way, and the day will come, in our time, when waste will be sought after by those entrepreneurial enterprises who will actively seek to encourage people to dump waste at their sites. It should come as no surprise that in time there will be financial incentives to attract waste by paying a sum of money per tonne to keep their businesses thriving. In essence, waste is revenue and it just does not stack up that a new tax should be incurred on the dumping of product that is of value.</Hansard-Body>

Furthermore, the fact that we do not have a refund amount for an empty plastic or glass container similar to the system used in South Australia is another example where we are not utilising other people’s ideas and we remain trapped in the same old way of doing things. This is not 1910, so let us embrace this cutting-edge technology, which is occurring as I speak in various locations within Australia and around the globe.</Hansard-Body>

Initiative 4: as we all know too well, time is money and, if we want to lead an efficient state, then we too must become efficient within the parliamentary process. More often than not there is a merry-go-round of repetitious hot air that circulates around the chamber. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086785"></A>
The Queensland Party will propose that we reduce our allocated speeches to bills from 20 minutes to 10 minutes, with the exception of the maiden speech and the budget reply speech; that shadow ministers would reduce their speeches from 60 minutes to 30 minutes; that speeches on clauses would be reduced from five minutes to two minutes; and that adjournment speeches would take place for one hour each night, instead of the current 30-minute allocation, from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm, at which time the House would rise. This would allow every elected MP the chance to speak for three minutes at every parliamentary sitting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086786"></A>
The proposal will also require that the guillotining of a bill is only possible by a vote of at least a 75 per cent quota of the parliament, or 67 of the 89 MPs. This model would ensure that we all finish at a reasonable hour and, whilst I, like many in this House, enjoy a sip of the old squashed grape, it would assist in preventing the very real possibility of the odd MP or two strolling into the House intoxicated. We all have family and friends to spend time with and an electorate of some 50,000 people who depend on us and, as the Leader of the House has previously suggested, this would enable us to be in a better frame of mind to debate and enact legislation at the next day’s sitting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086787"></A>
Initiative 5: the Queensland Party would negotiate a minimum percentage model to ensure that those regions where mining royalties were coming from were given a minimum required percentage in return so that those regions were best positioned to become economically sustainable, and that would become the foundation formulae to assist in a state-wide decentralisation strategy. This ‘royalties for regions’ approach, as has been implemented in Western Australia, will ensure that rural and regional Queensland get their fair serve of the porridge pot.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086788"></A>
It is an insult to the taxpayers of Queensland to pretend that there is a philosophy of decentralisation within the government ranks when all that is on offer is $4,000 which will successfully remove one from all accessible front-line services with an unrealistic expectation of living a comfortable life elsewhere. This $4,000 would simply cover the removal truck transporting your furniture from A to B, fuel for the car to take the family to the new house and the possibility of a simple barbecue to have a handful of friends over if you did not live too far away. Reality would hit when you realised there was no affordable public transport, no properly functioning local hospital and no adequate educational institutions. We should be using these coffers to fund front-line services into these communities to attract people to rural and regional communities for the long term.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086789"></A>
Initiative 6: the opposition has failed to produce any real policy when it comes to vehicle registration. The ‘freeze on registration’ catchphrase is simply that--a catchphrase. It is the same type of surface politics the LNP constantly accuses the ALP of engaging in. Everybody knows that one of two things would occur in a so-called registration freeze (1) you will get to keep a few dollars in your left pocket while a pair of scissors cut into your right one, or (2) the government would go without the revenue for a few years and jack the price up by 25 per cent to play catch-up on all moneys lost. Either option demonstrates the pointlessness of the whole announcement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086790"></A>
The Queensland Party would create a model to increase the cost of registration to those drivers who were found guilty of excessive speeding or drink driving and the moneys collected would be used to offset a greater pensioner discount and cheaper registration to those who abided by the law as an incentive to conduct oneself appropriately on the one hand and a deterrent to those who fail to abide by the law on the other. We need to instil good, old fashioned individual responsibility back into the public arena, and those who do the right thing should be rewarded.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086791"></A>
As I stated in my budget reply speech in 2009, we need to understand that politics is like a Rubik’s cube--the answer always lies within the problem. Brash and simplistic political slogans are outdated and the community expects and deserves a more considered approach.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086793"></A>
We all know the sale of our assets is simply not good enough. The depth and sincerity of the opposition to the asset sales is also not good enough. The opposition needs to realise that there is no alternative policy position with simple statements such as ‘we will stop the asset sales’ or ‘Queensland is not for sale’. Queenslanders are not stupid and know full well that by the time the LNP are campaigning at the next state election there will be no assets left on the market. Furthermore, it is no secret that the LNP are rubbing their hands with glee because the sales are occurring on the ALP’s watch and not theirs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086827"></A>
If both Queensland leaders are bereft of ideas then I suggest that the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition write to their respective federal leaders and ask Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott to intervene and assist immediately. They do not have any trouble knocking on the door offering assistance when it comes to various other state issues where it suits them, and the notable absence of both federal leaders on this issue demonstrates yet again that the two major political parties have become two heads of the same creature.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086828"></A>
Both federal leaders would be politically naive to let the current asset sales go through to the gatekeeper in the lead-up to the federal election, as history tells us that Queensland plays a large role in determining who will be Australia’s next Prime Minister. If we let these assets slide now, we will never get them back again--ever. Despite the 150 years of blood, sweat and tears by our ancestors, we are about to surrender this infrastructure to foreign ownership, who will in turn dictate to us the cost of driving over a bridge, hopping onto a train or purchasing imported goods arriving on our shores.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086829"></A>
This sale represents the peak of all madness. The Premier openly replied to a question without notice from me only three days ago regarding the worth of these assets in 10 years with this response--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086831"></A>
... while there is no forecast on those assets, as one would expect, with any precision, for 10 years time, what I think we can identify without any fear or concern is that QRNational Coal will grow between now and 2020 and it will grow regardless of who owns it.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

By 2025 we expect to see coal exports in Queensland come close to doubling.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086835"></A>
The sad reality is that the increased revenue streams will be channelled away to private, and in most cases foreign, ownership. It may well double in value to the owner, but you can bet your bottom dollar it will cost four times the amount to Queenslanders to access. Do not be surprised if it costs $12 in 2025 to cross the Gateway Bridge which we once proudly called our own. The fact that this government has not even bothered to investigate the projected revenue and value of our assets speaks volumes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086836"></A>
All parties need to take a deep breath, have a round table like mature adults and discuss a way in which we can get this state back on track. Asset sales will only be prevented by a bipartisan approach. It is time to cease the mudslinging and collectively devise a strategy to hold onto this critical infrastructure. We need to do it for Queensland’s sake and for the sake of our children. Stop the political stupidity of finger pointing and adopt a rational approach. Stop burning the taxpayers’ money putting each other down and utilise that money to hold a forum which can include national and international political and economic experts to assist. The longer I hang around this place, the more I realise that, collectively, none of the major parties actually has any answers, so why don’t we be humble enough to tap into the experts that do? These asset sales are so important that I think it is time for all sides to put down their plastic swords and get out the butcher’s paper. We must put the interests of current and future Queenslanders first. It is the only course of action we have left.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086837"></A>
In relation to the mining super tax and the implications it will ultimately have on future Queensland state budgets, there has been a lot said about the pros and cons of the proposal from many MPs, but Abraham Lincoln summed it up in one line when he stated, ‘You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.’ There will be monumental and unintended consequences which will come as a result of this ham-fisted policy. I appreciate the dangers of extreme capitalism and disproportionate wealth, but the reality is that, in an economic stockwhip, the movement may begin at the wrist but the cracker is the part that bears the brunt of this movement, and the cracker is those who are most vulnerable. </Hansard-Body>

A well-constructed and strategic plan to be able to increment and carefully increase revenue from those who can afford it through just means is absolutely essential. As a 30-year-old, I am at the beginning of what I refer to as the ‘rental generation’. We are living in times when it is almost impossible for my age group to enter the property market, even if there are two healthy income streams. Having purchased my first home in October last year, I do acknowledge and credit the Treasurer, who championed the waiving of the stamp duty for first home owners which made it a financial possibility for us to purchase our first home. This is an initiative from previous state budgets from this government that I will personally be forever grateful for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086839"></A>
I was quite surprised that no-one from either the LNP or the ALP mentioned the necessity of parliamentary reform. It is essential because what you will find is that the systematic problems we continue to encounter when it comes to fiscal responsibility are a direct result of an extremely primitive form of government operating in a futile parliamentary process where the political winner takes all. It never ceases to amaze me every time I walk into this chamber that the bills in queue have already been signed, sealed and delivered before they even come before the House. This flawed process makes a monkey out of all of us. The scoreboard for the current major parties is a predictable 51-32 week in, week out. If it was a football match, Sportsbet would shut down and the crowd would walk away--hence the empty public gallery and widespread disengagement in the current parliamentary systems we now have in place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086840"></A>
Queensland’s flawed political process is costing the state tens of millions of dollars annually--and in some instances billions--as a result of ad hoc policy alongside minimal public and political scrutiny. How long are we going to continue to kid ourselves and Queensland? Quite frankly, the people have had a gutful. The only way we will be able to deliver a budget to the Queensland people where we can hold our heads high, knowing that we have collectively done our best, is with the creation of a new political entity. A third political dynamic, coupled with the goodwill of the Independents, will encourage us all to pursue best policy. Fiscal responsibility and honest accountability have been missing in action for far too long, and the Queensland Party will provide an opportunity for all of us to get this great state back on track. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (6.45 pm): Table 4.1 on page 64 of Budget Paper No. 2 goes to the heart of this budget. It is a table that every member of this House should be aware of and every Queenslander should be aware of. The table sets out the general government revenue, and the figures within that general government revenue support the argument that I have made in this House continually that the importance of the mining sector in Queensland is grossly underestimated by people who sit in this chamber and is severely disregarded by the state Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086843"></A>
The royalties and land rents in table 4.1 show an estimated actual for the current year of $1.986 billion. The figure that the Treasurer is expecting to receive next year is $3.243 billion, some $1.3 billion extra. That extra $1.3 billion that the Treasurer has projected he will receive from the additional mining royalties next year is the money that makes this budget possible. Without that extra $1.3 billion, the whole budget would collapse in a heap.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086844"></A>
Every Queenslander should understand that the mining royalties that this state receives underwrite all of the political largesse that we have heard in this budget debate over the last couple of days. All the Labor members have stood up and talked about the schools, the roads, the toilet blocks and everything else that, through their diligence, they have delivered to their respective electorates. In truth, none of that is possible without the mining industry in Queensland. None of it is possible without that $3 billion. But that $3 billion is only the start of the contribution that the mining industry makes to Queensland. That is the direct royalty payment that the government gets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086845"></A>
The mining industry contributes around 20 per cent of the economic activity in Queensland. Indeed, in some areas--the areas that I and the member for Mackay represent--20 per cent would be very conservative indeed. The economic activity in our respective areas is considerably more than that 20 per cent. All of that economic activity also produces income for the government. So as well as the royalties that are shown in this budget, there is also all of that other income that the government gets when a young miner gets a job, buys a car, pays stamp duty on the car, pays registration on the car, buys a house and does all those things that young Australians should have the opportunity to do. All of that economic activity provides an economic return to the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086846"></A>
The thing that is missing from this budget is any consideration of the situation that this state will face if that economic activity is curtailed--and curtailed it will be if Kevin Rudd’s super tax is imposed on the mining industry. If that super tax is imposed on the mining industry, there is no guarantee that that figure of $3.243 billion will actually be realised. In fact, it is a pretty fair bet that that figure will not be realised simply because of the uncertainty that has been introduced into the decision-making process that mining companies already have to go through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086880"></A>
We have seen that in a very real sense in my electorate. The major coalmine that was proposed by Xstrata at Wandoan has now been suspended. That has had an immediately effect on my electorate, on my constituents. There are a great many of my constituents who are now unemployed, who will not be buying cars, who will not be buying houses, who will not be paying stamp duty to the state government simply because that tax is a possibility. If it becomes a reality there will be a whole lot more Queenslanders in the same situation as my constituents are in in Wandoan at the moment. They have had their lives put on hold because of the suggestion that that mining tax is going to be introduced.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086883"></A>
When members in this House consider this budget and look at the figure that the mining industry contributes they should also consider the situation that will eventuate if that mining super tax becomes a reality. It will affect this budget, but it will affect future budgets to a far greater extent as the investment from the mining industry that is required to continue to underwrite the Queensland economy dries up. That super tax introduces a degree of sovereign risk into the whole Australian investment scene that has never been there before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086884"></A>
The idea that the government can so callously change the rules under which those investments are made is something that will require all mining companies to reconsider their investments. Not only will some of those companies reconsider their investments to the extent that they will not make those investments, they will reconsider their investments by increasing or adding an increased risk premium to the investments they make to guard against such decisions in the future. It is a horrendous decision. It is a horrendous proposition for Australia. It is a horrendous proposition for Queensland because of our dependence on the mining industry that is so well illustrated by table 4.1 in Budget Paper No. 2. The Treasurer and the Premier should be on this case to a much greater extent than they have shown up until now because it represents a huge threat to their budget and to every Queenslander. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086885"></A>
The budget debate here in the parliament since the Treasurer introduced the budget has been somewhat predictable. We get a sense that we have heard it all before. Certainly the people of Queensland have heard it all before. They have heard all of this before from a government that they know is tired and is running out of ideas, running out of ability to properly administer the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086886"></A>
The people of Queensland have heard over the last few years the government talk about the fact that it could manage the debts that it was running up, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his budget reply speech. They have heard the government give reassurances about the loss of the AAA credit rating. They have heard that the health crisis could be fixed. They have heard assurances that the infrastructure was going to be available on time. They have heard assurances about our schools being brought up to standard. They have heard continued assurances that debacles like the nurses pay fiasco would be fixed and were under control. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086887"></A>
Of course, Queenslanders are fast coming to the conclusion that all that they have heard from the government cannot be believed. They are fast coming to the conclusion that it is not worth listening to the type of political rhetoric that we have heard from the government here over the last couple of days. The reality is becoming increasingly obvious to the people of Queensland. They know that there have been incredible blow-outs in government expenditure, as were outlined by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Clayfield, when he talked about the $9 billion worth of blow-outs that became obvious over the last three years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086890"></A>
In no area of government administration have those cost blow-outs been more obvious than in the provision of water infrastructure--the Gold Coast desalination plant, the wastewater treatment plants, the western corridor pipeline. Enormous amounts of money were wasted on those projects simply because they were built in a panic because the government could not build the infrastructure in an appropriate way. The ultimate example would have to be the Traveston Dam. The hundreds of millions of dollars that were wasted on what was a political diversion for a Premier in trouble really underlines and illuminates the financial management skills of this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086891"></A>
As Queenslanders consider this budget, they do so from a point of view that the figures that the government sprouts are not figures that can be believed. They are not figures that can be believed because they know that the expenditure programs will blow out, just as everything this government does ends up costing more than it should. They know those figures cannot be believed because the main revenue figure in the budget that the government depends on for the billions of dollars to make all of those programs possible is in fact being threatened by their own political colleagues in Canberra. Kevin Rudd’s super tax has the potential to torpedo this budget and make it worthless. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086892"></A>
Queenslanders know that they face a 54 per cent increase in their electricity prices. They know that they face a 47 per cent increase in their water charges. These are examples of the administrative failures of this government. It is interesting to see the Minister for Natural Resources and Mines today try to shift the blame for the increase in those water charges onto local governments. There is no way that local governments are going to bear the responsibility for that. The 47 per cent increase in water prices that South-East Queenslanders face is because of the increase in bulk water prices. Bulk water prices have increased because of the hundreds of millions of dollars that were wasted on the water infrastructure in South-East Queensland that I referred to previously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086895"></A>
Queenslanders know that they will face a 21 per cent increase in their registration. They know that they are paying more for their petrol now because the state Labor government abolished the fuel tax immediately after an election that they had to call early. They know that they were hoodwinked by that early election. It was an election based on deceit and dishonesty. I believe Queenslanders are waiting for the opportunity to ensure that the result of the next election will be very different. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086896"></A>
In my electorate we, like so much of regional Queensland, suffer from the want of infrastructure spending. This government depends more and more on the royalties that flow from the mining and increasing gas industries in Central Queensland but it is loath to reinvest in those areas. It is loath to invest in the infrastructure that is necessary to make it possible for our communities to function properly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086898"></A>
There is one screaming example which I would like to refer to tonight that has been causing a deal of concern in the community of Monto in my electorate. The community of Monto depends for its services on the regional centre of Bundaberg. I think it is the only such community on the eastern seaboard of Queensland where people have to navigate a very poor gravel road to get to essential services. They are delivered from Bundaberg. All of the health services, all of the regional government offices are in Bundaberg. There is a very poor road connecting Monto and Bundaberg. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086899"></A>
Unfortunately, recently there was a very tragic accident on that road where two people were killed. I have spoken about that in the House before. That accident has instigated a campaign in the area to have that road sealed. The community took it upon themselves to conduct a survey to establish, once and for all, the importance of that road to their community, especially with regard to the delivery of health services. The results of that survey show that some 80 per cent of survey respondents used the road because they were referred to Bundaberg for medical treatment. Some 80 per cent of people who responded to the survey, which equated to some 800 people across 415 households, had been referred to Bundaberg and had to travel across that very poor gravel road. Some 65 per cent of those had to do it regularly or often for repeat appointments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094558"></A>
The survey also established that some 40 per cent of respondents at some time had not attended a medical appointment because the road was in such poor condition. So 40 per cent of people were skipping medical appointments because of the poor condition of the road. Those figures alone reinforce the need for this road and such roads in Central Queensland to be upgraded as a matter of urgency. It is just not acceptable for people to have to regularly travel such roads to access medical treatments, and those medical treatments are increasingly only available in major regional centres. There is no doubt that the road is also considered a major safety risk by those who travel it regularly, with over 70 per cent of survey respondents saying they always felt unsafe while travelling the road. Even more concerning was the result that some 80 per cent of respondents had suffered a near miss on the road and 87 per cent had come across an accident or a breakdown on the road.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094562"></A>
As I said, this survey was instigated by the tragic death of two people, one of whom was a much respected teacher. The survey figures put beyond doubt or serve to illustrate to everyone the importance of those sorts of roads to regional communities. But it is those sorts of roads that need to be addressed before the communities of Central Queensland can properly function in the environment of great development that is happening right across Central Queensland. That development in the gas industry and the mining industry has a huge potential to provide facilities and a better lifestyle to every Queenslander, and that is illustrated in the budget. It is illustrated in the budget speeches we have heard here over the last couple of days, but those communities deserve the sort of basic infrastructure that is typified by the Monto-Mount Perry road. If a community like Monto cannot even get a decent gravel road to the coast so that people can drive there to see the doctor when they need to then this government is treating regional Queensland in a very poor and shabby way, and it is regional Queensland that provides those income streams that are illustrated in the budget and that make it possible for so many members to deliver the things they have talked about in their speeches.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094568"></A>
As I said, this is a budget of a government that is tired. It is a budget of a government the people of Queensland are having difficulty in believing, and it is a budget that depends very much on the revenues from the mining industry that can easily be taken away from the Treasurer and from the people of Queensland by Kevin Rudd’s super tax. The Treasurer, the Premier and the government need to ensure that Queenslanders’ collective voice is heard very loudly in Canberra to ensure that that does not happen. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (7.02 pm): This government is in decay, and what we see in this budget is a carcass of debt, deficit and despair. Debt has gone up by some $9 billion, and in three years time it will be $84 billion--far and away the biggest debt of any state government in Australia. We again have a deficit in this budget of hundreds of millions of dollars--over $200 million--and the deficits for the forthcoming years are estimated to be anywhere between approximately $1.5 billion and $2 billion per year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094574"></A>
The despair I spoke about belongs to working-class and low-income people, Queensland small businesses, pensioners and people on low and fixed incomes who face these massive electricity price rises, massive water price increases, massive gas price increases, massive increases in registration costs and a petrol tax. Local government sees the effect this year of the removal of the subsidy, and in Toowoomba’s case that means a loss of $6 million a year. We have seen stamp duty go up on second-hand cars and new cars.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094575"></A>
Everybody is feeling the pain, and throughout this debate no-one from the other side has mentioned this. No-one from the other side has had any sort of a social conscience about the families who sit around the kitchen table and see increases not of three per cent or four per cent but of 15 per cent. Electricity prices have increased by over 50 per cent in the past three years. Because the government was broke and sold off the gas arm, pensioners in my electorate saw a 350 per cent increase in the cost of their gas. They shivered through a Toowoomba winter and tried not to use gas for heating yet still found the bill about the same because it was being charged to them in terms of an access fee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094576"></A>
We have seen a doubling of water costs because of the government’s system of charging water through three separate levels--wholesale and then the pipeline system and then the retail system. We have seen this government over the years make government owned corporations increase their debt levels and pay over money to the government. That has increased their debt levels, but they still have to provide a dividend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094578"></A>
We have a government that is lacking in talent, but we do not have backbenchers who are prepared to stand up and speak out on behalf of their constituents about these price increases and about the cost of living. People cannot afford it anymore. It is too much for most people, and that is what happens when you are drowning in debt. Big debt will control you. You make the wrong decisions, you make bad decisions and you are forced to do things that hurt the people who can be hurt the most.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094580"></A>
What about the waste and the blow-outs? As people try to pay their electricity bills, as they fill up the average car with 50 litres of petrol with almost another 10c a litre extra they have to pay to the Bligh government, as they pay their rego, as they pay the doubling in water costs and all of the other things, what do they think about the $400 million blow-out on the health workers’ pay system? What do they think about the $700 million wasted on Traveston? What do they think about the blow-outs worth hundreds of millions of dollars on the Tugun bypass? What do they think about the hundreds of millions wasted and blown out on the desalination plant? What about the over $1 billion blow-out on the western corridor recycled water pipeline, which turned out to be an absolute white elephant? These are some of the blunders and the waste and the problems that have beset Queensland and it is the poor people who pay, because the government’s debt is the people’s debt and the people are the ones who have to pay it back.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094585"></A>
New South Wales has long been regarded as a basket case and everyone likes to throw off at them, but we now have debt in Queensland of $18,700 per person while in New South Wales it is $9,758 per person. New South Wales, like all the other Australian states, has kept its AAA credit rating. Queensland has lost its and, as a result, we pay a penalty interest on every single loan that we have. It is like throwing money away--just throw it down the drain! We have lost our AAA credit rating and therefore we have to find all of these hundreds of millions of extra dollars in penalty interest and pay it, and that of course puts everything up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094586"></A>
We need to bear in mind that many of these increases--in petrol, water, registration and fuel--affect the cost of living for groceries, furniture and everything else that people need, because everything in Queensland goes by truck. Everything is carted to Toowoomba or Rockhampton or Townsville or Cairns or the suburbs of Brisbane by truck, and everybody pays because everything is costing more in order to pay back this debt. The tragedy of it is that we are not seeing any capital reduction in the total amount of the debt. We are seeing the debt go up by $9 billion in this budget and it is going to go up again in the next and the next and the next until it reaches $84 billion. Calculate the interest on that! Calculate the penalty interest on that and see if there is anything left at all for any capital reduction in that debt under this current government and the way that it operates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094587"></A>
On top of that, the problem we have in Queensland is that the latest figures in unemployment have shown an increase from around 114,000 to 132,000, yet we have a government that backs Kevin Rudd on the mining super tax. We saw what happened with Xstrata in that 3,250 jobs in the Surat Basin at Wandoan were lost. We recently heard about a firm in Dalby that had a contract to manufacture the brass plaques that go on all of the gas-drilling bores with the details of the bore. That was a $100,000 contract put on hold. I know of a stevedoring firm in Toowoomba that was going to be handling the ore from Mount Isa via Townsville to Port Pirie. That contract has been put on hold. How many jobs are going to be lost by all of these projects being put on hold? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094591"></A>
This is all happening at a time when Queensland motorists are being absolutely slugged like never, ever before. Queenslanders used to proudly boast that it was the best place in Australia to own a car. Now we have the dearest rego and now we have a petrol tax like the rest of Australia when we never had one before, and having no petrol tax was an attraction for people to come here to live and do business. On top of that, there is extra stamp duty on new and second-hand cars and extra costs on B-doubles and B-triples that cart all of the goods around this state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101303"></A>
Then we see the cut in road spending, even though money is pouring in. But the one that tops it all off is the bungled Health pay. You would wonder how the health minister could sit there and not question his bureaucrats and say, ‘Have you got a parallel system to run with this? Is it foolproof? Has it been checked? Have you tried it?’ You would think that of 18 cabinet ministers sitting around the table, when they saw a $400 million project come before them--and they are all supposed to read through it over the weekend and have their bureaucrats check it and everything else--one person would have asked, ‘Will this work for the most complicated and largest pay system in the state?’ But no, obviously no-one did. So they went ahead and now we are looking at anything from another 18 months to two years where the good health workers of this state--the casual workers, the wardsmen and wardswomen, the nurses, the physiotherapists, the doctors and everyone else--are going to continue to face this absolute shameful disaster.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101304"></A>
There is a light at the end of the tunnel because the opposition, through the opposition leader’s budget reply speech, has come forward with a number of positive policies to add to what has already been announced. Firstly, we will work to get this state back its AAA rating and stop the waste of hundreds of millions of dollars that is flowing down the drain because of the loss of that AAA rating. We will oppose and stop privatisation. We will have a debt repayment strategy as a specific part of the budget so that we can stand up and say, ‘This is what the debt was, this is how much has been paid off, this is how much interest has been paid’ so that, like any proper business with its shareholders, the people of Queensland know what the debt is, how much it has been reduced by, what the interest repayments are, how we are managing all of that and how the mess that has been left behind by Labor is being managed in a responsible way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101305"></A>
We will certainly oppose the super tax on mining with every breath, because that is one of the worst things that has ever happened. The federal government wants to usurp this state. We get royalties from the mining industry and on top of the royalties, which, from memory, were doubled by the Queensland government in last year’s budget, the mining industry pays company tax. There will be a freeze on the cost of registration for motorists and also for those with boats, trailers and floats. There will be electricity relief for seniors, which is worthwhile. We will help small business by making payments within 30 days. We will stop the underspend on infrastructure and contracts over $500,000 will be publicly available for scrutiny. We will also have a policy on prime agricultural land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101306"></A>
Queenslanders are looking for responsibility. When you have the trust of the people to spend their money carefully to provide them with services, with the necessities and with the important infrastructure that they need, they want you to do it responsibly. They do not want you to waste their money; they want you to be as careful as they are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101307"></A>
There is a shortage of time and I want to assist the House with what has to be passed by 7.30 tonight. I just want to comment on the fact that $4.7 million has been gratefully received for the Toowoomba Airport. I make the point that the council, which is responsible for the airport, has seen $6 million a year taken out of its state government grants. So $4.7 million has come in and $6 million has been taken out by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101309"></A>
Last year, I asked a question about the need for CareFlight, which receives an allocation of $1.6 million a year, to expand its services so that it can operate seven days a week. Currently, it operates only during holidays and, at the moment, operates on the generous donations of many people, big and small. Unfortunately, I believe this allocation of $1.6 million will mean that it will still be very important for CareFlight to have a major donation scheme. I also make the point that, because the choppers have to fly a long distance, we need to have twin-engine helicopters rather than the single-engine Squirrel which has been a good workhorse but has certain shortcomings regarding distance and winching capacity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101311"></A>
 The integrated cancer service is something that I am very grateful for, because it partners the need for the state government to provide the recurrent funding for the nurses and the doctors with the federal government’s system of providing the capital works. I have spoken about that previously. Vocational education is important. Also, there is ongoing funding, which has been announced in previous years, for the National Carriage Factory and the fire station at Kitchener Street, Harristown State High School and some other facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101315"></A>
I plead with the government to fix up the Health pay system. Toowoomba health workers are desperate and they are under stress. It is an absolute debacle. It has to be fixed. In the interests of time, instead of speaking for my usual 20 minutes, I will cease because there is the necessity for this debate to be concluded at 7.30 pm. </Hansard-Body>

Ms DARLING</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Sandgate--ALP) (7.14 pm): I want my children to grow up in a Queensland that offers them the best education, job opportunities, public transport choices, top-class hospitals, affordable housing and a sustainable natural environment. The 2010-11 state budget is a sensible budget that provides protection for those most in need, whilst sticking to the plan of delivering the services and building the infrastructure that Queensland needs to provide the jobs and security to drive our economic recovery and maintain and improve our standard of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101318"></A>
The Bligh government went to the last election with jobs as its key the platform. It promised to create 100,000 new jobs for Queensland. Yesterday’s job figures show that we are almost halfway there, with the remaining target now 50,700. Last month, 8,800 new jobs were created in Queensland, which is the most of any state and nearly half of all the jobs that were created nationally. Of those, 8,200 were full-time jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101319"></A>
This budget will continue the government’s record infrastructure building program, with another $17.1 billion allocated for 2010-11. Building means jobs and jobs means dignity and financial security for all of those Queenslanders who are able to work. This budget delivers those services and facilities that must be provided by government: schools and teachers, hospitals and health workers, roads and transport infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101320"></A>
The government made difficult decisions to formulate last year’s budget and this year we are seeing the start of our economic recovery. Our economic strategy is working and it is delivering more jobs and higher growth. We will divest specific government owned corporations that can be run well by business--rail freight and coal, forestry, port and toll services--so that we can invest more in education, public transport, health and safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101328"></A>
Deagon railway station certainly deserves a renovation and I have asked the Minister for Transport to consider including Deagon in this program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The rail spend is on top of $260,000 to upgrade traffic signals on Deagon Deviation at Deagon Road and the off-ramp and Bracken Ridge Road intersection, Brighton as part of the Bligh Government’s Safer Roads Sooner program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101331"></A>
These upgrades will improve traffic flow and safety. I know it can be very difficult negotiating the off-ramp and traffic flow at the round-about at Bracken Ridge Road so these improvements are very welcome.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101332"></A>
Commuters to and from Redcliffe will not only notice improvements on the Deagon Deviation following the spending of this budget allocation, they will also benefit from the brand new $315 million Ted Smout Memorial Bridge which officially opens on 11 July with traffic moving across the bridge later in the week.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101334"></A>
The education of our young people is integral to the future of our state and I welcome spending in excess of $1.14 million for new learning centres, upgrades to amenities and general maintenance at our local schools.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101335"></A>

The school was devastated by a fire last year which destroyed an entire building block.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101337"></A>
This funding will enable the replacement of an existing amenities block that is in extremely poor condition, and replacing some toilets that were lost in the fire.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101338"></A>
Sandgate State School will be able to spend a further $368,000 in 2010-11 to complete the major upgrade of four classrooms under the State Schools of Tomorrow Round 2 program. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101342"></A>
Many members of our community are unable to work full time because of their disabilities and need our support.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101343"></A>
There are also many living with disabilities who are able to work or further their education and it is just as important to provide them with opportunities to contribute to our community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101344"></A>
I am thrilled that the 2010-11 budget will deliver a record $1.61 billion for disability and community care services across the state.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101345"></A>
Extra funds allocated for 2010-11 will go to supporting young people with a disability who are leaving school and looking for training and work options, extra support for people with spinal injuries and early intervention and support services for families of children with disabilities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101346"></A>
We are determined to continue assisting young people to move out of aged care facilities and to make sure they don’t end up there in the first place.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101347"></A>
The Bligh Government’s record $9.99 billion health budget for 2010-11 is a ten per cent increase on last year’s budget and is catering not only for population increases but for professional, medical and technological advancements as well.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101348"></A>
Our $7.33 billion health infrastructure program, the largest in our nation’s history, is building and expanding hospitals and health services where they are needed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101349"></A>
In the Sandgate electorate, the budget provides for another 44 transition care beds at Eventide to help people get out of hospital sooner and rehabilitate at Brighton before going home. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101350"></A>
This builds on the significant federal and state funding that has resulted in the refurbishment of Dolphin House to a state of the art transition care facility.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1101351"></A>
The Queensland Government is continuing to make good progress on the $45.6 million development of a paediatric emergency department at The Prince Charles Hospital, to be completed by 2012.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101352"></A>
Once completed the paediatric emergency department will provide 12 new emergency treatment spaces and a 20-bed short-stay observation unit for Northside families and their children.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101353"></A>
Extra funds have also been allocated to fix the health payroll system that has impacted on many health staff in the Sandgate electorate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101354"></A>
The mistakes with the payroll system are unacceptable and should never have happened.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101355"></A>
Our dedicated health employees deserve every dollar they have earned for their hard work and I urge them to contact the payroll helpline or contact my office if they are having any outstanding pay problems.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101356"></A>
While the economy rebuilds there are still so many people who will never be able to own their own home and cannot afford the rising rents that are being experienced in the Sandgate electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101357"></A>
It is so important for people to stay connected with their community and not be forced to the fringes of suburbia in the search for affordable housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101358"></A>
The Fitzgibbon Chase development is shaping up as a state-of-the-art environmentally sensitive and community focussed precinct and I am pleased that the first people should be moving into their affordable homes by the end of the year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101359"></A>
Those freehold houses have sold quickly but there is also construction under way by Brisbane Housing Company to provide a range of apartments in a small complex near Carseldine station.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

$4.37 million in this budget to provides for the completion of 48 units with a total contribution of $10.95 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101361"></A>
BRIC Housing has also been allocated $7.71 million to build 49 units in Brighton with a total cost of $13.42 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101362"></A>
Bluecare and Bayside Community Options do so much to help older people and people with disabilities to remain supported at home and I am pleased to see over $5 million allocated for both organisations to continue this great work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Bligh government recognises that current economic conditions are placing a lot of pressure on low income households.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101364"></A>
Last year we increased the rebate for pensioners’ power bills and this budget increases the cash back amount even more.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101365"></A>
From 1 July 2010, the maximum rebate will increase from $190 per year, to around $216. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101366"></A>
People with medical conditions who need their airconditioners to be set to regulate their body temperatures have asked the government to consider their plight.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101367"></A>
We’ve listened and this budget establishes a new Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Commission Scheme to assess those eligible for a rebate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101368"></A>
Pensioners can also apply for assistance with their water bills. Up to $100 is available for eligible pensioners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101369"></A>
And of course we will continue our ClimateSmart Home Service program which can help all households save money on power and water and help save the planet in the process.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101370"></A>
Participants can save up to $325 per annum following a home service.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Bligh Government is also delivering for the environment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101372"></A>
The new industry waste levy will encourage recycling and hopefully make dumping a last resort.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101373"></A>
This is not a residential waste levy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101374"></A>
In fact, the revenue raised will be directed to targeted programs to assist business and industry to reduce the amount of waste they generate, and to encourage industry investment in recycling technologies, and to councils to spend on environmental projects, focussing on better waste management facilities and practices. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101375"></A>
Any surplus funds will be dedicated to environmental initiatives, including the acquisition of national parks.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101376"></A>
A significant funding boost will also help the Bligh Government reach its target of achieving 7.5 per cent or 12.9 million hectares of national park.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101377"></A>
Over the next five years we will spend $55.9 million on acquisition programs so we can protect more of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1101378"></A>
The thoroughbred racing industry is an important part of the Sandgate area so the $95,000 allocated to Deagon racecourse for ongoing cost and maintenance of the training facilities is welcome.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101384"></A>
The collection of suburbs, residences and people that make up the Sandgate electorate are diverse yet community focussed. We love our lifestyle and reach out to those in need and I trust this budget will support all that we do to make our community a special place to live.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101385"></A>
I thank and acknowledge all of the wonderful community organisations that provide services and friendship to local residents and I am pleased to see the budget allocations including recurrent funds for these groups.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101386"></A>
I look forward to working with local sporting groups on their grant requests, with local schools on improving our education system, with seniors groups on service and rebate information, and with any of my constituents who need my assistance.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (7.16 pm): I rise to speak in support of the government’s Appropriation Bill 2010. As the member for Albert, I wish to put on the record my thanks to the government, and in particular the Premier and the Treasurer, for achieving in challenging times a strong, responsible budget and for delivering on Labor’s promise to create more jobs sooner for the working families of Albert. In particular, on behalf of my constituents who live in the northern suburbs of Albert, I am very pleased that my efforts in working hard over a long time, including holding meetings with the Treasurer and the Minister for Main Roads, who is in the chamber here, together with his department has meant that the 2010 budget delivers $1.2 million for improvements for the busy intersection at Beenleigh-Beaudesert and Tallagandra roads.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101392"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wallace:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Hear, hear!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101393"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs KEECH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I acknowledge the support of the Minister for Main Roads. I have much satisfaction in achieving this funding for the $8 million road project, which is so very much needed by the more than 20,000 drivers who travel Beenleigh-Beaudesert Road many times a day. When I return to my electorate I will have great pleasure in reporting back to the 818 people who signed my petition for the upgrade to the road, which was tabled in the parliament on Tuesday, 8 June 2010. I will tell them that, in sending the government a strong message, the first step towards improvements for the busy stretch of road has been allocated funding. I thank the Treasurer for his economic strategy in ensuring that the funding is, indeed, available.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101394"></A>
This $8 million project will also include installing traffic signals and making improvements to the Saratoga Street and Wuraga Road intersections, providing an extra lane through the intersection to increase capacity, upgrading streetlighting and, at my request, improving safety and facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. This state government project is just the first step in delivering for the people of these fast-growing communities who rely on this important arterial link road. I have told the minister, Craig Wallace, that I will not be happy and will not rest until, as the petitioners request, the road is significantly upgraded to four lanes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101397"></A>
I seek leave to have the rest of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Hoolihan): Order! It has been checked by the Speaker?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101399"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs KEECH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It has been checked by the Speaker.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101401"></A>
In supporting families, the budget brings good news for mothers with newborn babies. They will be supported by receiving up to six visits from registered nurses as part of Government’s pilot announced in the Budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101402"></A>
$55 million has been allocated over the next four years to the Helping Out Families initiative which will also fund community organisations to provide referral services and intensive support, based on an assessment of a family’s needs though a Family Support Alliance.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101403"></A>
As the former Child Safety Minister, I know how effective prevention and early intervention measures are in keeping families together and children safe.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101404"></A>
I welcome the Government’s commitment through the Helping out Families project which will be piloted in Logan and Beenleigh from October, and the Gold Coast early next year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101405"></A>
However, after listening to the Leader of the Opposition’s speech where his promises offer no costing and no funding, my constituents would have every reason to be greatly concerned that, if the LNP obtained Government, this service for families and children together with other important infrastructure projects in Albert would not only be frozen and but not delivered at all.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101406"></A>
As the latest jobs figures show, in contrast our Budget is a responsible one, building on the foundations for a stronger economic recovery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101407"></A>
Yesterday’s jobs figures show that Queensland is once again the biggest jobs generator in Australia.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101408"></A>
Almost half of the 18,400 jobs created in Australia last month were created in Queensland. In one month, 8,800 jobs were created for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101409"></A>
There is a massive difference between us and the Opposition on this: we are driving and creating jobs through our strong economic strategy, the LNP’s jobs target is zero.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101410"></A>
As we saw in the reply by the Leader of the Opposition, those opposite have no policies, their promises are not costed, not funded and cannot be believed. They are perpetrating a cruel hoax on the people of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101411"></A>
The LNP, if in Government, would drive Qld further away, not closer, to regaining our important AAA credit rating.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101412"></A>
On the other hand, the jobs figures show Qld is again the job-generating capital of Australia, it’s a huge vote of confidence in the Government’s economic strategy and I commend the Treasurer on his budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101413"></A>
As the Government Whip, I would also like to commend another person--the Parliament’s senior telephonist PAULINE KAVANAGH on her retirement today after 24 years working at Parliament House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101414"></A>
Although not every member will know Pauline’s face, each and every one of us would recognise her cheerful voice when, each morning over the PA system, she welcomed us to a new sitting day. Best wishes in your well-earned retirement Pauline and we will certainly miss you.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.20 pm), in reply: I would like to thank all members for their contribution to this debate on the appropriation bills. This budget of the Bligh Labor government is a strong Labor budget. It is a budget that delivers lower debt and lower deficits. it delivers higher growth and more jobs sooner. It funds our future growth. It makes the investments in the building program that a growing Queensland, that a regionalised Queensland, needs. It brings forward the construction of the Springfield rail line to make the South-East Queensland corner more liveable into the future. It provides the Regional First Home Owner Grant to ensure that the growth is spread across Queensland and the prosperity goes across Queensland. It funds the front-line services that a growing population needs. It funds the 316 teachers and teacher aides, the 203 police, the 35 front-line child protection workers and the 75 ambulance officers. It funds the 720 nurses, the 180 doctors and the 300 allied health professionals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101552"></A>
But it also makes the investments that are important for those Queenslanders that we represent on this side of the chamber. It provides more support for those families who have a child with a disability. It provides more support to those young people who are leaving school and transitioning into the community. It provides support for people with a spinal cord injury and it provides support for some of our most vulnerable families, some of our most disadvantaged families, those families with young children, where we will provide extra support as we move to invest in secondary services to avoid the tragic heartache and the tragic consequences of people coming into contact with the child protection system. What we are doing is funding investment in pain clinics that can help injured workers get back to work earlier. We are funding hope by doubling the number of cochlear implants that young Queenslanders born profoundly deaf can receive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101553"></A>
This is a budget that makes those choices and it makes them all as part of an economic plan that we put in place, that we put in place in the last budget, and that is delivering. It is delivering jobs, as we saw yesterday, where Queensland for the second month in a row is the jobs generating capital of Australia. There have been 8,800 jobs created. There have now been 10 straight months of job generation in this state, more than 63,000 jobs, as we are well and truly on track to deliver on our policy commitment to the people of Queensland to deliver a net new 100,000 jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101554"></A>
The verdict on our commitment to jobs, on elevating the dignity of work and the decisions that we have taken, came in just as the opposition leader was delivering his budget reply and the verdict of millions of Queenslanders was being formed on what he put forward to the people of Queensland as an alternative. It is an extraordinary turn of events that the opposition leader of this state should be so ashamed, so embarrassed of his budget reply, that he refused to answer questions. He ran away up to level six and reached for the old teddy bear from his university days and hung on to it; so ashamed and embarrassed was he of having a budget reply that did not mention a dollar figure and that did not put forward a costed policy. All that was put forward was a cruel hoax on the people of Queensland who want to see real policies, but what were they offered? They were offered platitudes. They were offered the rhetoric that comes from the Jake Smith polished words that are focus grouped to within an inch of their life and churned out by the goons on level six, all sanctioned by ‘Uncle’ Bruce McIver who is really running the show. They wheel the Leader of the Opposition in here and he reads them out without passion, without originality, without a policy idea and without a costing to support it all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101555"></A>
It was the most embarrassing effort that this chamber could have expected. Can members imagine another opposition leader in the country running away from the chance to prosecute an argument about their own budget reply; running doggo, which is what this opposition leader did? What we saw this week was the distinction between substance and style: those of us on this side of the chamber interested in policy substance and an opposition leader only interested in glamour shots. What we saw was what the putative leader of the putative Queensland Party so aptly described in his criticism of the LNP moments ago as the surface politics of the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101557"></A>
What we might reflect upon here, for those members of the LNP present, is whether they all feel that they are in the box seat. For them they are already across the line. For them they already arrogantly presume that it is all theirs, that they have won, that they need do nought. Why else would they make no policy effort? I wonder during those 45 minutes when the opposition leader was on his feet whether they did not think for a moment and doubt what it would be like, whether they really had the confidence that it is this opposition leader that could stand the heat of an election campaign, whether they really had confidence that this opposition could stand there through an election debate when the blow torch is on, when it has to front up with the policies, when it has to front up to the questions and when it cannot run away from it. I suspect that during that tortuous, shallow 45 minutes the penny just might have started to drop. </Hansard-Body>

On this side of the chamber what one sees is proud Labor government that is proud of a strong Labor budget. In the great tradition of Labor governments this is a government that has put forward a budget that provides assistance to those Queenslanders who need it most. It provides relief to householders. We have made the choices that define us: the choice to invest in the future of working class kids not in the interests of coal companies’ balance sheets. </Hansard-Body>

It is in the proud tradition of Labor governments in this state and the proud tradition of us forging a new chapter for Queensland, out the front doing the heavy bullocking.

Queensland Public Holidays</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1109349"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (7.30 pm): It has been brought to my attention by concerned constituents and residents of the Lockyer electorate that there should be a realignment of public holidays for a modern Queensland in the 21st century, starting with the first holiday after Christmas and New Year, which is 26 January, Australia Day. Whether it falls on a Saturday, Sunday or another day, it should be commemorated on that day. I have been to Australia Day ceremonies where recipients of awards have had to rush off to work or have not been present because the ceremony was held on a Saturday or Sunday and the public holiday falls on the Monday. How crazy is that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109350"></A>
Easter weekend is aligned with the moon but always includes Friday and Monday. Surely Anzac Day must be celebrated on 25 April. Labour Day is held in May. I researched Labour Day. In Russia it is no longer a significant event. Like Russia, in Queensland Labour Day is not a significant event. With only about 18 per cent of Queensland workers in a union, the people realise that Labour Day has significance but only historically. It is not really a modern holiday. I suggest that the first Sunday in May be the Labour Day holiday. There would be no need to celebrate on a Monday. The march could start at around 12 o’clock so that participants can still go to church and so on. The country that has the biggest labour force in the world is China. It has realised that Labour Day is no longer that significant and has taken the day off its important events calendar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109351"></A>
I also suggest that the Labour Day public holiday be moved to Melbourne Cup day, which is a much more significant day than Labour Day. The vast majority of Australians and Queenslanders are involved in this day, from charity fundraising to social events or just watching the race. To Australians, the Melbourne Cup is important. Let us move the Labour Day public holiday to the day of the Melbourne Cup.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109352"></A>
The next holiday is the Queen’s birthday. Queen Elizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926, yet we celebrate her birthday in early June. Let us move that celebration to 6 June, which is Queensland Day. That is the day that Queen Victoria gave approval for the colony to become Queensland and signed the Letters Patent. Let us the improve the understanding of our history and have a Queensland Day holiday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109353"></A>
Melbourne Cup Day is an important day for all Australians. Let us celebrate a Queensland Day for all Queenslanders. The changes that I propose are to celebrate Labour Day on Melbourne Cup Day and the Queen’s birthday on Queensland Day. Let us bring the holiday roster more in line with the 21st century. Let us do something for this state that has significance, unlike the mob opposite who procrastinate about issues and ideas. Let us have some ideas. Go Queensland! Let us change the Queen’s birthday holiday to Queensland Day and move the celebration of Labour Day to Melbourne Cup day. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (7.32 pm): Volunteers devote countless hours of their own time to improve opportunities for others without need for reward. A volunteer’s contribution to their community cannot be understated, and their efforts in the Greenslopes electorate are certainly appreciated by both me and the broader Greenslopes community. Volunteering is something that means a lot to me. As many honourable members would know, I spent three years in the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu as an international development volunteer with Australian Volunteers International. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109361"></A>
This government recognises the efforts of volunteers and we have included in our Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland plan a target to increase the level of volunteering in the state. One organisation that has numerous volunteers encouraging the physical, intellectual, emotional and social development of young Queenslanders is Scouts Queensland. Scouting encourages young Queenslanders to help build a better world. Scouting helps young people gain important skills that hold them in good stead throughout their lives. Those skills help them play a constructive role in society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109362"></A>
Majestic Park Scouts and Victor Scout Group are two such scout groups in the electorate of Greenslopes, and I had the pleasure of attending each of their annual general meetings last month. Scouting is important because it recognises the significance of individuals developing a sense of identity, responsibility for oneself and actions as a citizen, and the importance of adults providing suitable role models for young people. Majestic Park Scouts and Victor Scout Group instill in their members the importance of respect and equality in dealings with all people, irrespective of race, creed or social standing, as well as the importance of mutual support for members within the community to enhance the quality of life for all. They focus on initiative, teamwork and cooperation as well as community service and spirit. The development of leadership skills is a fundamental part of the scouting program, which ultimately helps today’s young Queenslanders become tomorrow’s leaders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109363"></A>
Open to both boys and girls, each scout group comprises of Joey Scouts for ages six to eight years, Cubs for ages seven to 11 years, Scouts for ages 10 to 15 years and Venturers for ages 14 to 18 years. Majestic Park Scouts has 14 Joey Scouts, 54 Cubs, 14 Scouts and 11 Venturers who meet weekly on Monday, Tuesday and Friday nights at their scout hall at the corner of Eva and Octantis streets, Coorparoo. Victor Scout Group has six Joey Scouts, 12 Cubs, 13 Scouts and one Venturer who also meet weekly on Monday, Tuesday and Friday nights at Victor Street, Holland Park. In addition to weekly meetings, Majestic Park Scouts and Victor Scout Group take part in numerous activities throughout the year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109366"></A>
Both scout groups owe a lot of their ongoing success to their team of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers who take great pride in encouraging our young Queenslanders to reach their full potential. Two group leaders I would especially like to mention are Peter Kinne of Majestic Park Scouts and Bill Beach of Victor Scout Group. Bill, in particular, has spent eight years as group leader and retired from this duty last month. However, he remains actively involved within the group. Peter is also standing down after many years as a group leader. Peter and Bill voluntarily gave up a considerable amount of their spare time as part of their dedication to developing the young Queenslanders who move through the program into future community leaders. They are committed to ensuring continuity within their scout groups and believe in leadership succession. They will continue on in other capacities in the immediate future to assist other parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109369"></A>
The commitment of parents is fundamental to the future of these groups through their involvement in leadership roles, fundraising, assisting with activities, excursions, camps and transportation to name a few. The Majestic Park Scouts has 22 leaders and five uniformed helpers, making a total of 27 uniformed parents assisting the group. There are also six parents serving on the committee and in specific project organising roles. I highly commend the work of both groups and thank Bill and Peter for their ongoing work in assisting young people in our state. </Hansard-Body>

Nerang Street and Nicklin Way Intersection Upgrade</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109373"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (7.35 pm): I rise this evening to draw to the attention of the House the absolute debacle that was the planning and consultation process for the Nerang Street and Nicklin Way intersection upgrade. In October last year, a letter was sent to some businesses on Nicklin Way providing information, including maps, regarding the Department of Main Roads’ plans for an intersection upgrade. The letter did mention that some parking spaces may be removed from the Nicklin Way. However, there was no indication on the map where those spaces might be and which businesses would be affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109374"></A>
In early May this year, a further letter was sent to some businesses detailing that work was to commence on the project later that month. This letter contained the same map as the one that was sent in October but, amazingly, this time all of the car spaces that were being removed as part of the intersection upgrade were detailed. So the consultation letter to businesses made a reference to the possibility of parking spaces being removed, then there was no further consultation other than a new letter outlining that the project would begin in the coming weeks and clearly detailing which car parks were going--all of them. For the benefit of the House, I table a copies of the maps.</Hansard-Body>

Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Main Roads maps of Nicklin Way/Erang Street intersection upgrade.</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109376"></A>
The consultation process for this project was a complete farce. The minister’s department has admitted that in a public meeting held recently with the business owners. Despite what the minister may think or has been told, half of the businesses never received a letter at all and some of the businesses received only one of the two letters that were sent regarding the project. On top of that, there was no clear indication that the first letter was, indeed, the consultation process seeking feedback, and the cunning way the maps were changed between October and May is a disgrace. Is it any wonder the owners and managers of these small businesses were outraged? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109377"></A>
I am pleased to see that, after a week of intense negotiations between the department, myself and the business owners and operators, the project was at least stopped for review. I thank the minister for that. On behalf of the business owners I submitted a list of proposals and suggestions that would satisfy their car-parking requirements and still permit the intersection upgrade to proceed. Why does it take all of this drama to get the process right? After the consultation process was revealed as obviously flawed, a review of the database was undertaken by the Main Roads regional office and the database amended. This should have happened before the initial letter was sent in October. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109378"></A>
At a time when the economy is in recovery mode and jobs are at a premium, saving these small businesses is pivotal to the local economy. On-street car parking is vital to their survival, given the amenity and access to the major arterial road in the Nicklin Way. What was even more dumbfounding for me is that engineers in the CoastConnect project team have indicated that they wish to extend the road to include a high-speed bus lane which retains the on-street car parking, yet engineers and planners from the same department, Transport and Main Roads, have said that on-street parking cannot be safely retained. So with a merging lane for cars it is not safe to keep on-street parking, but put a bus lane there and somehow the government thinks that is safe enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109379"></A>
I ask the minister: why is there no consistency in terms of safety provision by his department? I would hope that when this project planning is now reviewed a commonsense approach is taken by those planning the upgrade and the government retains the on-street car parking for all the businesses impacted and affected. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (7.40 pm): Increasing congestion in Brisbane suburban streets is frustrating for all motorists living in our capital. Congestion towards Milton Road at the Toowong end of the Centenary Motorway has worsened over recent years. Residents of the Centenary suburbs have long awaited a solution to this congestion, and I am pleased that the Northern Link construction will soon be underway. The Lord Mayor, at a local Chamber of Commerce meeting a number of years ago, virtually guaranteed a 20-minute run for commuters to the city when the Northern Link was built.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116983"></A>
At the other end of the Centenary Motorway, Main Roads has worked to improve the interchange outbound in conjunction with a massive upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. This work has resulted in uninterrupted traffic flows at that end. However, more motorists from the south are choosing to use the Centenary Motorway as the quickest route to the city. This has resulted in rat-running through the Centenary suburbs over recent months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116984"></A>
Any upgrade to the Centenary Motorway and a proposal for transit lanes must complement a solution to Moggill Road, Milton Road and the Northern Link. We cannot have a transit lane for buses that come to a standstill at Toowong. At my request, planning studies were initiated about the Centenary Motorway since 2005, and I want to ensure that all of the projects are coordinated appropriately minimising inconvenience to motorists.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116985"></A>
It is a real pity that the LNP councillor for Jamboree chose the long-awaited news of the Northern Link tunnel to politicise this issue, bagging the state government and me over the congestion on the highway. As soon as he had word that I was sponsoring a local petition, the following week he pushed his leaflet distributor to work late into the night to deliver another version of a petition to people in his ward. I received a copy of this other petition at 10.30 pm in my letterbox on the following Tuesday night. How much did this politicking cost ratepayers? The councillor thinks he is clever, but others think that he is trying to deceive them into diluting the authority of the petitions that I am sponsoring as state member.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116986"></A>
The Main Roads minister can confirm that on many occasions I have talked to him about the Centenary Motorway and have asked him for funding for a traffic management policy to address current congestion hotspots on the on-ramps at Jindalee, Mount Ommaney and Sumners Road. As a consequence, in this budget $1.2 million has been allocated for the provision of variable speed limit signs at various locations on the Centenary Motorway, $443,000 has been allocated for removal of vehicles and $7.3 million for bus park and ride bays at Jindalee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116987"></A>
Late last year Main Roads carried out consultation in relation to the duplication of the Centenary Motorway overpass at Sumners Road. Stage 2 of this consultation for the Sumners Road bridge duplication will soon commence. I am glad to see that the council has followed suit with a promise to upgrade some hotspots on other parts of Sumners Road. </Hansard-Body>

Hendra Virus</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116990"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (7.42 pm): On the Thursday of the last sitting week I received a call late in the afternoon from the Premier advising that Hendra virus had been discovered in my electorate at Tewantin. Coincidentally, the mayor of the Sunshine Coast was at Parliament House at the time and within an hour the Premier’s department had arranged a complete briefing on the situation. I would like to record my thanks to the Premier and her officials, health personnel and Queensland’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Ron Glanville, for the speedy and accurate briefing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116992"></A>
Flying foxes play an important role in our environment. However, increasingly, due to the loss of their habitat and the encroachment of humans into what remains of it, a serious health issue has arisen, not only via the spread through horses of the Hendra virus but also as a result of large flying fox colonies living over or around residential communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116993"></A>
We have seen attempts to relocate the flying fox colony at North Eton near Mackay and ongoing efforts by the community of Charters Towers to get a similar approval in place. These residents have had to wait years trying to bring their plight to the attention of state authorities. LNP members, particularly the member for Dalrymple, including myself, have raised these concerns time and time again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116994"></A>
Since the Hendra virus outbreak at Tewantin, governments have combined to spend $600,000 to perfect a vaccine which will not be available for at least another five years. As a result, there is little doubt that there will be further outbreaks of Hendra virus and more communities subjected to the filth, stench and other health problems caused by roosting bats living too close to humans.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116995"></A>
In the recent Sunshine Coast experience, a member of this House called for the culling of flying foxes. Others here already hold that view; I do not. The current move-on methods of fog, loud noise and bright lights are only marginally effective, but there are companies who have developed other methods including radar applications for around farms and others which prevent bats flying into wind turbines used for power generation. Ultrasonic devices have also been developed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116996"></A>
The government is failing in its duty of care to Queenslanders if it does not protect its citizens from the health dangers of large colonies of flying foxes living in close proximity to humans. It seems that, if it happens in Charters Towers or North Eton, it is okay. If similar numbers of bats moved into West End or Mount Coot-tha or Lytton or Ashgrove, I wonder how long before action was taken.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116997"></A>
The government must research what methods are available to safeguard the health of humans and that of flying fox populations. Not to act risks the intervention of some who will attempt to cull flying foxes which will result in closer contact between these mammals and humans, and that is a health risk we cannot afford to have. </Hansard-Body>

Urimbirra Retirement Village</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124712"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (7.48 pm): I would like to again bring to the attention of the House the problems of residents at the Urimbirra Retirement Village in Hervey Bay and the extremely urgent solution that is needed to solve their issue. This matter was first raised by the previous member for Hervey Bay in this House on 25 October 2005 and again on 8 November 2005.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117017"></A>
Urimbirra is a pretty and peaceful retirement village in Hervey Bay consisting of 49 units. Prior to October 2005, a company called Milstern Retirement Services Pty Ltd purchased some 30 of these units from the owners at the time of a residential contract under the Retirement Villages Act 1999. I am informed that Milstern has purchased further units since this date. I am informed that Milstern now owns some 36 units, but this number is as yet unconfirmed. The company has rented units to the public.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117057"></A>
The existing residents who had purchased their units in good faith under the Retirement Villages Act had felt disadvantaged by this purchase of a majority of units by one entity and putting them in a ‘renting pool’. They were concerned among other things about the value of their units and the contributions paid for the maintenance of the village.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117058"></A>
Subsequently, they sought a decision from the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal on the matter. A decision was handed down on 17 May 2010, and QCAT made two orders that will have a dramatic effect on the livelihood and wellbeing of elderly citizens in my electorate. This decision, I understand, may also have ramifications in other areas in Queensland. It said that the respondent, which is Milstern, must not rent units that it owns in contravention of the Retirement Villages Act 1999 and that the respondent must take all action necessary to ensure that the tenants who reside at the village under an agreement other than a residence contract within the meaning of the Retirement Villages Act 1999 be removed from the village forthwith but with consideration to the obligations under the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117060"></A>
It is not my intention to question the decision of QCAT or to question the rights of the lessees, Milstern, or the tenants in this instance, or to pass a judgement on or for any of them. What we have here is, putting it mildly, a mess. In my opinion, this shows a lack of direction by the relevant departments over time and possible flaws in legislation. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (7.51 pm): I am incredibly proud of the work of the teachers, staff and students from the schools in the Morayfield state electorate. I am passionate about the value of education because, when governments invest in education, we invest in people, we invest in the potential of people, we invest in opportunities for people. That is why I am particularly pleased that the 2010 Queensland state budget invests heavily in education programs and initiatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117064"></A>
This year’s budget allocates over $9.5 billion to Queensland’s education system. This includes the recruitment of 316 additional teachers and teacher aides and funding for an additional 5,000 teacher aide hours per week. In addition, further funds will be made available to support the continued expansion of kindergarten programs into long-day-care services and to establish a new scholarship scheme to help eligible early childhood education and care professionals upgrade their qualifications.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117065"></A>
In the Morayfield state electorate, this budget will fund, among other things, the construction of new classrooms at Caboolture Special School and literacy, numeracy and science teaching coaches. As State Education Month comes to an end for this year, school communities around Queensland can celebrate the record investment by this state government in local schools. One of the highlights of the last month was State Education Week. As part of State Education Week, state schools around Queensland opened their doors to the broader community. This annual celebration provides our schools with an opportunity to display all aspects of the work and recreation of each school community. During the week, our community can specifically recognise the students, teachers, parents and carers whose efforts in the classroom, and as part of the broader school family, we can be rightly proud of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117066"></A>
Members of parliament have the opportunity to more fully understand the valuable work of our schools by participating in State Education Week. As part of State Education Week, I spent time as principal for a day at Caboolture Special School. As principal for a day at Caboolture Special School, I participated in and presented certificates at the school assembly, did some paperwork on behalf of the principal, attended a staff meeting, toured the school and discussed important matters with one of the school captains, Paul Smith. Paul is a great young man who is passionate about his school and the broader community. Paul is an impressive advocate for his school. I take this opportunity to thank principal Jan Biggam, deputy principal Ric Day, and all teachers, staff and students of Caboolture Special School for their hospitality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117071"></A>
I also spent time as principal for a day at Morayfield East State School and had the opportunity to participate in a question and answer session with year 7 students. The year 7 students at Morayfield East State School are very interested in the role of government and have some great ideas for our community. They are great role models for the younger students and I wish them well for their future schooling. Thank you to principal Dr Brian Gray and all the people at Morayfield East State School for making me feel so welcome.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (7.54 pm): I would like to highlight the achievements of the Boonah community. It is a very small township of 2,500 people but they were able to raise some $20,000 for the implementation of a hydrotherapy pool in Boonah. This is a fantastic effort. It was coupled with dollar-for-dollar funding by the federal government. The community has certainly provided a blueprint for other communities around Queensland if they want to see how it is done. The therapeutic pool will be open for all those elderly residents who like to soak their bodies in the pool. It certainly is great to see that the community was behind that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117078"></A>
The budget for Beaudesert had a couple of repeat items with the $3 million to construct a bridge for the Waterford Tamborine Road--which has had a good guernsey--$3.1 million to finalise the upgrades at the Jimboomba substation and also $13.4 million for the initial planning and development of the proposed Wyalong water treatment plant. We had that opening a couple of weeks back. I want to highlight the announcement of the three super cities and the two that will affect the northern end of the Beaudesert electorate--that is, Yarrabilba and Flagstone. I would like to see the government make a commitment in terms of the infrastructure for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117084"></A>
I have been particularly pleased with the health minister, who basically let Hazel Brittain do a six-month investigation into the possibility of midwifery at the Beaudesert Hospital. About 120 people came to that community consultation two weeks ago. It was a great turnout. There is a lot of great pride in the community to think we might be able to get those services back into the hospital. I also look forward to meeting with the Minister for Main Roads. I appreciate him taking the time to come out on 23 June to investigate the possibility of a Boonah to Kooralbyn connection road, given that the Kooralbyn resort has been defunct for two years now. That community is currently going through some economic hardships. It is absolutely critical that there is more than one entry and exit. What Beaudesert needs in the next couple of years is a new school because many are at capacity as we speak. It would be ideal to plan for the future, considering we have Bromelton, which is a State Development Area earmarked by the government. It is absolutely critical that we look at passenger rail. I have been told at this stage that it will be investigated for 2030-31, but given the two satellite cities and Bromelton, which has vital links to New South Wales, we should, pardon the pun, fast-track that to before 2031. I think the next five years would be ideal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117086"></A>
I thank the government and the Treasurer for offering those few items, but I still will be advocating for many more issues within the Beaudesert electorate. I would like to put on record the 50th anniversary of the Beaudesert Lions, who held a fantastic function last Saturday. It is people like that in the community who keep the fabric of the community alive and well. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your time and indulgence. I hope everyone has a great time brainstorming some more ideas over the next seven weeks. </Hansard-Body>

 (Mulgrave--ALP) (7.57 pm): An integrated and coordinated approach to planning for sport and recreation is essential between state and local government.

I am very aware that representatives from sports and community groups have already been widely consulted to inform Cairns Regional Council’s Park and Recreation Strategic Plan 2010-15. While the task force will be a mechanism by which all groups can have a say, the aim of this task force is not to repeat the exercise. It will focus specifically on the southern suburbs of Cairns and aim to prioritise and progress planning for facilities and activities.</Hansard-Body>

With the recent announcement by the state government of a raft of sports funding packages over the next three years, it is vital that we pull together multiuser funding bids when applying for funding for this fast-growing area. Simply put, the task force is about reducing duplication, removing blockages and seeking to get the best bang for the buck in terms of usable land and spending of public money. Cairns Regional Council should be congratulated for its more than $13 million to safeguard land near Isabella State School at Edmonton and the expansion to the Alley Park precinct at Gordonvale. </Hansard-Body>

But it is not only about planning for the future. There are problems right now that need to be addressed. Both levels of government are already struggling to meet the high demand for sporting facilities, in particular green space for sport and recreation which is at a premium in the southern corridor. For example, Edmonton Storm Senior Rugby League play their games at Barlow Park in Cairns and have several different training venues. I am the patron of the junior feed-in club, which is based at Petersen Park and is already bursting at the seams. A permanent home must be found for the senior club, and another rectangular field option would also support the needs of Southern Crusaders Rugby Union Club. Through the task force I am putting the case to the government to consider the parcel of land adjacent to Petersen Park--previously set aside Education Queensland land. It would allow the Edmonton Storm to actually play in Edmonton and would relieve the pressure being faced in the southern corridor enormously.</Hansard-Body>

The recent closure of the iconic Sugarworld Waterslides highlighted the limited affordable recreational options in the southern corridor to keep the younger population active and engaged. Local facilities like the Edmonton swimming pool have served the community well but need to be upgraded. I know that council is well advanced in its planning for an Edmonton indoor sports and aquatic facility. While the sport of tennis will be boosted enormously by the completion of the $5.2 million regional tennis centre at North Cairns, plans for an upgrade to suburban courts at Edmonton need to be brought on-stream as soon as possible.</Hansard-Body>

I do not claim that the Southern Corridor Sport and Recreation Taskforce will work miracles, but I do know that its members will work together for the good of our local area. I look forward to the challenges ahead.</Hansard-Body>
