Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, part 9 of the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2010 amends the Parliament of Queensland Act by, amongst other things, setting up a statutory basis for the Register of Members’ Interests and the Register of Related Persons’ Interests. The part commences on proclamation. Recently Standing Orders Committee members agreed by correspondence to a replacement schedule 2, which is necessary to harmonise the new statutory regime and schedule 2. The changes do not affect the current registration requirements upon members.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, today at 12 noon I will be officially dedicating and launching the Speakers’ Corner--a space devoted to encouraging Queenslanders to speak and engage in open and vigorous debate. Located in the George Street forecourt just outside of Parliament House, the Speakers’ Corner is a legacy project for the people of Queensland to mark their parliament’s 150th anniversary. In May of this year we celebrated this significant anniversary with a number of events and activities including an open day, wine launch, dinner debate and book launches. During the highly successful open day held on 22 May 2010, I unveiled the Speakers’ Corner project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000039"></A>
In 1860, members of Queensland’s first parliament assembled for the first time and 150 years of peaceful democracy has followed. As Speakers’ Corners around the world are based on the philosophy of freedom of speech and grassroots democracy, it was appropriate to unveil the creation of a legacy project encouraging the people of Queensland to come to their parliament and have their say, to engage in vigorous debate and to gather for peaceful protests. I invite all members to attend this significant dedication and launch event.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-998412"></A>
As honourable members may be aware, the Brisbane City Council is in the process of implementing a CityCycle bicycle hire program and is installing CityCycle stations over inner-city Brisbane. Approximately 10 months ago, incidentally whilst seeking approval from the Brisbane City Council for the installation of Speakers’ Corner, the Parliamentary Service became aware of plans to install CityCycle stations in the parliament’s forecourt. Over the past 10 months there have been a number of meetings to discuss the CityCycle installations and correspondence with regard to their proposed location. I believe the Parliament House forecourt is unsuitable for such a facility for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it would be seriously incompatible with the present use of the Parliament House forecourt, for example its use on ceremonial occasions such as the opening of Parliament; as a focal point for demonstrations; as a pedestrian mall for large numbers of people accessing the Queensland University of Technology; and it would have a seriously detrimental impact on the visual amenity of Parliament House, the state’s premier heritage building.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998425"></A>
After a meeting between Councillor Jane Prentice and myself in late May of this year and following discussions with council officers and the Clerk and the Lord Mayor’s office and my office, I was under the impression that a satisfactory resolution had been reached. It is my understanding that the idea of locating CityCycle infrastructure in the forecourt area had been knocked on the head and was dead and buried. However, in recent weeks it has come back to life. On 12 and 18 October 2010 the Parliamentary Service received correspondence outlining the proposed installations and locations which contradicted what had been agreed to. The Parliamentary Service was completely unaware of the disclosures in the correspondence--namely, the installation of City Lights billboards in the Parliament House forecourt area and two CityCycle stations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998436"></A>
I have sought urgent clarification of these matters from the Lord Mayor. I believe the Parliament House forecourt must be preserved and protected from moves to install structures of one kind or another that can seriously compromise the heritage values and visual amenity of this historic location. I have written to the Lord Mayor stating that, whilst I understand that the CityCycle project is a significant project to reduce transport environmental impact, the implementation of billboards and CityCycle stations that are not in keeping with the heritage nature of the precinct and potentially may impede peaceful protests and other uses of the area should not proceed. I await the Lord Mayor’s response. However, I signal to the House that, should a satisfactory resolution not be found, I will have no hesitation in asking this House to implement whatever legislative protection is required to protect the heritage of Parliament House and ensure access to peaceful protest in our forecourt is unimpeded. I trust in this Assembly to provide that support.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, on 15 October I was delighted to attend the Parliamentary Lions Club’s Jazz on the Green 2. I was joined at this event by a number of honourable members. I am sure that those members will agree with me when I say that it was an excellent evening. Unfortunately, bad weather forced a venue change to the Premiers’ and Speakers’ halls, but this did not detract from the event. Of course, the event had a serious purpose, and that was to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. I understand that events such as this will be held each year to raise money for charity, and I encourage all honourable members to attend the next event.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): Today we mark the passing of two distinguished Queensland political personalities--former AMWU State Secretary, Austin Vaughan, and former tireless Parliamentary Library member, John McCulloch. These were two men who in different ways played important roles in Queensland’s political landscape throughout their lifetimes and both will be laid to rest today in what I am sure will be well-attended funeral services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999941"></A>
Austin, affectionately known to us all as ‘Aussie’, was an extraordinary man with many achievements. He served as the State Secretary of the AMWU for 20 years--one of its longest serving senior officers. He was born in 1929 in the small town of Pinnacle at the base of the Eungella Range in the Mackay sugarcane growing region. In truly fitting Rocky style, Aussie did his apprenticeship as a fitter and turner at the Rockhampton railway workshops and he continued to work there until 1970, when he moved to Brisbane as an organiser and later became State Secretary of the newly formed Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. Aussie was one of a prominent group of colourful Labor leaders to emerge from the Rockhampton railway workshops during that period. He joined such names as Jack Edgerton, Jack Deveraux, Bryant Burns, Harry Hauenschild and Ron ‘Buster’ Keating to name a few. Some might say they have a lot to answer for! These were his peers--all metalworkers, fitters, turners and boilermakers, all from the trades that Aussie himself came from and which he represented with distinction over his 20 years as State Secretary of their union. Aussie served as the President of the Queensland peak union movement, currently called the Queensland Council of Unions, from 1990 until his retirement in 1994. He was also a delegate to the ACTU during his time as State Secretary of his union.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000169"></A>
Aussie was known for his quiet achievement. He was always involved in the industrial and political events of the day, always encouraging reforms to better the lives of working Australians and society at large, but rarely in the media. Such dignity in his work afforded widespread respect. He also mentored an entire generation of trade union officials and aspiring politicians. Aussie is survived by his wife, Jean, herself a prominent community and peace activist in her time, their children Claudia and John, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. </Hansard-Body>

Equally, the achievements of Mr John McCulloch are also extraordinary. John was known to many on both sides of the chamber. He was a senior parliamentary research officer, joining the Parliamentary Library in 1984 and remaining there for 10 years. John was an excellent research officer and he wrote several research background publications for general distribution to members and also to a wider audience. His Parliamentary Library background papers stood out, particularly his paper <Hansard-Italic>
Women members of the Queensland parliament 1929-1994</Hansard-Italic>
, published in 1994 by the Parliamentary Library. The library produced an exhibition in association with this publication and at its opening all women members to that date were present, apart from the two who had passed away. I believe the Leader of the House would have been present at the exhibition in 1994. That was the year before I was elected. John’s paper was a very important record of the political history of the House and the chamber to date.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000181"></A>
John was born in London in 1938 and moved to Australia with his parents when he was 12 years old. As a young man he worked at Bayards--and some of us will remember Bayards--as a shop assistant and managed to complete his senior through night school. John was a researcher with a special interest in the advancement of gender equity in politics and as part of his research into women in politics John identified the original petitions in Queensland that called for women to get the vote. It was an important piece of research. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000183"></A>
John was awarded an Order of Australia Medal in January 2000 for service to youth, especially his 17 years of voluntary work for the Queensland and Australian Youth Hostels Association. In addition to his work on women and politics, John served as convenor of the Homelessness Taskforce 99. He was also a part-time researcher for St Vincent de Paul. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000187"></A>
John co-convened with Mary Crawford the International Women in Politics conferences for many years in association with QUT and, as the Speaker outlined yesterday, he was scheduled to give the welcome address at the next conference to be held on 5 November as part of the Queensland parliament’s 150th celebrations. The word ‘progressive’ is bandied about constantly in political circles and its definition is widely argued, but to my mind John McCulloch was a true political progressive. He was a deep thinker, an activist and a doer. I extend my condolences and those of the government to the families of both Aussie and John.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.43 am): The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that Queensland businesses are embracing research and development and, through that R&amp;D, embracing innovation. From 2006-07 and 2008-09, Queensland companies increased their expenditure on R&amp;D by $231 million to a total expenditure of more than $2.3 billion. That tells us that Queensland businesses see research and development as absolutely critical to their future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000193"></A>
Both the Queensland government and the Australian Industry Group could not agree more. That is why the government and the Australian Industry Group have joined forces to deliver a new grants program that aims to help businesses put their bright ideas into action. The program, which is an initiative of this year’s budget, is now developed and will be available. The program, titled ‘What’s Your Big Idea Queensland?’, is a $2.5 million pilot program designed to help individual companies innovate and invest in innovation or R&amp;D to improve their performance and, in doing so, strengthen Queensland’s economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000196"></A>
I want to thank the Ai Group for partnering with the government on this important project that is aimed at small to medium sized enterprises employing up to 200 people. One million dollars will be spent in the current financial year supporting businesses to introduce innovative new processes and systems and commercialise their new ideas. Businesses will be able to apply for up to $50,000 to access the expertise they need to put their ideas into action to grow their business. Applications for the program open today and will be judged by a panel of business and innovation experts, including Brett Godfrey, the former CEO of Virgin Blue; Arun Sharma, QUT’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor; Jim Walker, the CEO of QMI Solutions; and Kate Morrison, the principal of Vulture Street Consulting. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our expert judging panel whose experience is highly valued not only by the government but also by the Ai Group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000203"></A>
‘What’s Your Big Idea Queensland?’ will bring together the business and research communities to develop and implement new products and services that can help make Queensland businesses even more productive and profitable. ‘What’s Your Big Idea Queensland?’ recognises that businesses are often best placed to come up with the bright ideas needed to boost the performance of their specific business. This program rewards innovators by providing the funds they need to turn their bright ideas into action. Applications are available on the government’s website and they close on 10 December 2010. I am sure there are a number of members on both sides of the chamber who know of small and medium sized business operators in their own area who would find this grants program very beneficial to their businesses. I encourage them to actively promote the program in their local areas. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Beaudesert Hospital</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000206"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.47 am): Recently I had the opportunity to visit Beaudesert Hospital, along with the local member, Aidan McLindon. Together the member for Beaudesert and I met the staff, reviewed the facilities firsthand and discussed the critical issue of maternity services for the region--an issue of high importance to the local community. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the continued commitment that the member for Beaudesert has had in advocating on behalf of the community, in particular for the return of maternity services to the hospital. I would also like to thank and acknowledge the staff at Beaudesert Hospital who play a vital role in the delivery of health services and who are to be commended for their continued hard work and dedication.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000207"></A>
This recent visit has further firmed my view that the Beaudesert Hospital has an important role to play in servicing the health needs of the growing Scenic Rim community, as the member and others here know too well. Bringing back birthing services to Beaudesert is a complex issue and a matter that we are taking very seriously. I am committed to ensuring that the Beaudesert community, as a growing community, has access to safe and sustainable maternity services, including birthing. Already we have begun work in this space in an effort to provide a greater range of services and support to mothers and their newborns in the area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000209"></A>
At the last election this government committed to enhancing maternity services to support pregnant women in regional and rural Queensland, improving access to antenatal and postnatal care and, where possible, allowing pregnant women the opportunity to give birth within a closer proximity to home, which is of particular importance to Indigenous women wanting to give birth on country. This commitment included service enhancements of the existing antenatal clinics in the Logan-Jimboomba-Beaudesert area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001178"></A>
Already these service enhancements have seen additional antenatal and postnatal care for women in the Beaudesert community and outreach to the outlying community. A continuity of care model--midwifery group practice--commenced in May this year at Beaudesert Hospital. Midwifery-led continuity of care models use a primary healthcare philosophy. The Beaudesert midwifery group practice is enabling Beaudesert women to develop a meaningful and supportive relationship with the same midwife throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period. I am extremely supportive of the midwifery-led continuity of care model that acknowledges that pregnancy health care is not solely about the birth of the child but the support and health care the woman receives through the pregnancy, including before, during and after birth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001181"></A>
The midwifery group practice is currently providing Beaudesert women access to the same midwife providing antenatal and postnatal services through the Beaudesert Hospital with birthing services at Logan Hospital. An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health worker is also assisting to support this initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001182"></A>
From 1 July all women with low-risk pregnancies have been able to receive all pre and postnatal care at the Beaudesert Hospital, only having to travel to Logan for the actual physical delivery. However, as the member for Beaudesert knows, the community is calling for the further enhancement of these maternity services--the ability for low-risk birthing to occur at Beaudesert Hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001183"></A>
I would like to thank the member for Beaudesert for enabling a meeting between myself and members of the Beaudesert community where I was able to hear firsthand the importance of access to birthing at Beaudesert Hospital. I would also like to acknowledge the document presented to me by the senior group health services task force, a task force built of partnerships between residents, local service providers and the local government. I would like to thank a number of members of the Scenic Rim council who were there as well. I reiterate to the Beaudesert community that we are listening to you. </Hansard-Body>

 Was John Brent there? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001186"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, John was not able to get there, but I acknowledge John’s strong interest in the area. Check your facts before you interject. He was not able to be there. But I am not going to put him in it. His deputy and others were there. I always say do not ask a question that you do not know the answer to. A project funded through the Rural Maternity Initiative was tasked with examining the feasibility of primary birthing services at Beaudesert for women not expected to have birthing complications. Queensland Health is now currently giving consideration to the safest and most appropriate manner to introduce birthing services at Beaudesert Hospital for low-risk birth, enhancing the midwifery-led continuity of care model. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001187"></A>
While these efforts are underway, I wish to further reassure the House, especially the member for Beaudesert and the Beaudesert community, that the Bligh government remains absolutely committed to returning birthing services to Beaudesert as soon as possible. But we must always remember that the most important consideration is the safety of women, families and their babies and ensuring that we get this process right to provide the safest and most appropriate delivery of these services in the future. As I am sure the community would also agree, safety remains the key determinant in the timing and method of reintroducing services to Beaudesert. It is important that we look at all of these issues in full and that is why we are looking at when and how we can introduce these services over time.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Ethanol</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001190"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.52 am): In 2006 the then Beattie government proposed to apply a five per cent ethanol mandate across the fuel supply in Queensland. The mandate was proposed from 31 December this year. The Bligh government has conducted a full regulatory impact statement and public benefit test process, along with the publication of an exposure draft of proposed legislation. The exposure draft of the legislation did not mandate that all fuel would be required to contain ethanol. The mandate was to apply to only those retailers with 10 or more sites--that is, small business operators were excluded from the proposed mandate. The mandate as drafted does not require that regular unleaded petrol be removed from sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001191"></A>
There has been a significant debate amongst key stakeholders about the mandate. It is accurate to say that the proposal’s merits and disadvantages are more finely balanced than other policy proposals. The public benefit test itself concluded the proposal to be essentially neutral. Many groups, including some ethanol producers, do not favour mandates. The Australian Lot Feeders’ Association, other primary producers and service station owner representatives do not support a mandate. The peak motoring group in Queensland does not support a mandate, with opposition also coming from boaties and the Queensland Historic Motoring Council. Cane growers are supportive, recognising the diversification benefits potentially available from an ethanol mandate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001192"></A>
The mandate was proposed at a time when taxation arrangements were settled firmly in favour of domestic ethanol. Under the current taxation regime the full 38 cents of federal fuel excise is effectively not applied to ethanol produced domestically. This provides an enormous advantage to domestic ethanol production and enables blended fuel to be sold marginally below regular unleaded prices. Since that time many changes--more mooted than implemented--have been advanced in relation to taxation arrangements for ethanol and other biofuels. As it stands today, domestic ethanol remains effectively free of federal excise, with a zero effective excise arrangement in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001193"></A>
It has long been proposed--originally by the former federal government--to transition to introduce federal fuel excise on domestic ethanol. In the last federal budget a timetable was proposed to introduce excise on domestic ethanol. The proposed phase-in was set through to 2015. After the federal election a new timetable through to 2020 was proposed in correspondence underpinning the formation of the new federal government. Under the proposed arrangements the current 38 cent differential to the advantage of domestic ethanol will be progressively closed to nil by 2020, with both domestic and imported ethanol to be subject to an effective 12.5 cents per litre federal excise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001194"></A>
A discussion paper on these issues was issued by the federal government on 15 October 2010. Submissions on new taxation arrangements have been called for by 12 November 2010. Draft legislation is proposed in 2011. It is, of course, the case that passage of these changes will require support from both houses of the federal parliament. The already complex recent history of proposed new fuel excise arrangements, coupled with the reality of the structure of the new parliament, makes these matters far from settled. The potential here is clear. New federal taxation arrangements will reduce the competitive advantage of domestically produced ethanol. Given supply constraints in the market, there is a potential for the regional development goals of the policy to be frustrated by the mandate being met through imported ethanol. All of these uncertainties provide cause for caution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001195"></A>
The government has therefore resolved to suspend the implementation of the ethanol mandate. The initial suspension will be in place for at least 12 months. The government will be making a formal submission to the Commonwealth’s call for submissions. I table a copy of the Commonwealth’s taxation discussion paper.</Hansard-Body>

Our support for the ethanol industry has seen ethanol now form about 2.5 per cent of the total fuel supply in Queensland. The government itself--a large consumer of fuel--utilises around half a million litres of ethanol per month. It is worth noting in this context that, as the government fleet has been recalibrated to focus on greener cars, the uptake of diesel has formed a larger part of our fuel usage. Queensland government consumption has increased from 180,000 litres per month at the end of 2005 to 660,000 litres per month now. We are essentially half-way through to the proposed percentage without yet providing for it to be mandated. Some 550 service stations offer motorists the choice of an ethanol blend. We will continue to support development of all-important second generation technologies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001198"></A>
The government sought to advance the cause of ethanol as a cleaner fuel stock with regional development opportunities. The potential changes to taxation arrangements contained within the latest proposals do require careful consideration. The suspension being announced today does not derogate from our ongoing commitment to support increased use of renewable fuels. The policy path to securing such diversification does, however, require reconsideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001199"></A>
The suspension of the ethanol mandate is a decision not taken lightly. It is, however, a decision that is in the public interest in the circumstances today. This government has not and will not shy away from making the tough policy decisions. I look forward to the debate which will ensue from today on how best to promote renewable fuels. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.57 am): I would like to acknowledge in the gallery members of the Queensland Special Olympics team and their families. On behalf of everyone in the House, I welcome them here today. The Bligh government has placed a high priority on making Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people. It invests more in sport and recreation than any other state or territory. We provide funding and deliver programs designed to maximise opportunities for all Queenslanders to lead a healthy and active lifestyle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001203"></A>
In line with this commitment, I announce today that we will support our Special Olympics athletes who are attending next year’s Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece. We are fortunate to have some of those athletes here in the gallery today. I am proud to announce that we will support each individual athlete with the same financial assistance given to Queensland members of the Olympic, Paralympic and Commonwealth Games teams--that is, $5,400 per athlete. </Hansard-Body>

This will be a total of $175,000 to support the 31 athletes. As members can see, the athletes and their families did not know about it until the announcement just then. This funding will help the Queensland athletes meet costs such as travel, uniforms and training to attend and compete in Athens. I particularly thank the member for Sandgate, Vicky Darling, who brought to my attention the plight of these athletes with intellectual disability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003727"></A>
I would also like to acknowledge the attendance in the gallery today of Shaun McKee, a constituent of the member for Sandgate--I had the great pleasure to meet him and his carers--and his fellow athletes and families who will be absolutely delighted to receive this funding. We wish them all well on their journey and the best of luck in the competition. I would also like to acknowledge other members, including the member for Brisbane Central, for their representations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002502"></A>
The Bligh government is also providing $50,000 to Special Olympics Australia to assist with a range of activities including employing qualified trainers and coaches, training volunteers and raising awareness of disability. We are very happy to get behind these special Queenslanders and Special Olympics Australia, which does a great job in providing access to training and quality sporting opportunities for people with an intellectual disability. </Hansard-Body>

On another matter, I am happy to announce the securing of a V8 round for Ipswich in 2011, to be held from 19 to 21 August.

The announcement means that Queensland will host three rounds of V8 Supercars--Townsville, Gold Coast and Ipswich events. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Public Holidays 2011</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002508"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.00 am): In 2011, for the first time in the history of Queensland’s public holiday legislation, Easter Monday and Anzac Day will fall on the same date--25 April. Both Easter Monday and Anzac Day are nominated as public holidays under the Holidays Act 1983. As the minister responsible for the administration of that act, I can designate a substitute public holiday for any of the public holidays listed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002509"></A>
In accordance with those provisions, I have decided--after considerable public consultation--that a substitute public holiday for Easter Monday will be observed on Tuesday, 26 April 2011. This means that Queenslanders will enjoy a rare five-day long weekend as a result of this once-in-a-generation clash of dates. This is the first time this has occurred in the three decades that we have had public holiday laws. These days represent two of the most significant religious and national events on our calendar, and the government firmly believes that the community should have the opportunity to celebrate both. However, this decision will not result in an extra public holiday. It is merely transferring a public holiday, which workers are entitled to, to the following day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002510"></A>
This decision is good news for workers, particularly those who are employed in occupations that tend to operate over holiday periods. Our decision means that employees working on either 25 or 26 April, or both, will get public holiday penalty rates according to their relevant award or agreement. This will not increase overall wages costs for employers because, as I have already said, the decision maintains the same number of public holidays as in 2010. This decision has been made after consultation and consideration of submissions from a range of stakeholders including unions, employer organisations, religious organisations and the RSL. It means that public holidays in Queensland for the 2011 Easter period will be: Good Friday on 22 April, Easter Saturday on 23 April, Anzac Day on 25 April, and a substitute public holiday for Easter Monday on Tuesday, 26 April.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002511"></A>
Workers deserve a consistent number of public holidays each year to allow for rest, relaxation and celebration of significant religious and cultural events. The decision also ensures consistency with most of the other states and territories. These changes mean that the Anzac Day public holiday will remain on 25 April. The limitations on business operations that occur on Anzac Day because of its special nature will continue to apply. </Hansard-Body>

As a Labor minister for industrial relations, I also want to express my condolences to the family of Aussie Vaughan, a stalwart of the Queensland union movement. Aussie was a humble, honest and honourable man, respected by workers, employers and governments alike. I salute his life’s work which was dedicated to improving the lives of Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

This edition expands on the previous 2008 report with more detailed information on the impacts of climate change in Queensland and on the implications for key sectors, together with suggestions on some of the adaptation options. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002519"></A>
It draws on more than 220 peer reviewed climate science reports released over the last four years to describe what climate change will mean for Queensland’s environment, industries and communities. There have been a number of climate change reports published recently by national and international bodies. Whilst these reports are useful to give an overview of the climate change impacts expected globally and across Australia, the report I am releasing today provides a uniquely Queensland perspective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002520"></A>
The report tells us that Queensland is getting hotter, sea levels are expected to continue to rise and the impact of extreme weather events will increase. Of particular concern is advice that our iconic Great Barrier Reef will be impacted by increasing acidification and warming of the ocean due to more carbon in the atmosphere. This means greater threats to the unique corals of the reef because, as the water gets more acid, coral growth is reduced and as it warms it encourages the kind of algae which blocks essential light to coral.</Hansard-Body>

Five members of the independent Climate Scientists Australia network, including Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg from the University of Queensland, will be here to answer MPs’ questions and to provide us, as decision makers and community representatives, with the facts about what climate change means for Queensland. The Bligh government is committed to providing current and accurate information to help all Queenslanders understand what climate change means for us and our communities. This informs our government’s commitment to investing in climate change programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002528"></A>
While action at an international and national level is vital to combat climate change, the Bligh government is already helping Queenslanders to make a difference. We are already taking action to help communities adapt to climate change through our $196 million ClimateQ climate change strategy--a nationally recognised package of programs to help all sectors of the community reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.06 am): We know Queensland’s population is set to double within 50 years. That is why we made liveable and affordable communities a fundamental part of our response to the Queensland Growth Management Summit. We have a plan to keep housing affordable for people on low and middle incomes and we are taking action now. The member for Sunnybank knows that seniors and families in her area want an affordable place to live. And I have great news. We are turning almost 10 hectares of state owned land in Coopers Plains into a master planned urban village with a mix of affordable and social housing, shops and green spaces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002534"></A>
It means affordable homes for around 800 seniors, students, families and singles just 12 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD. This innovative development has train stations and buses within walking distance that connect it to the nearby Sunnybank and Garden City shopping centres, as well as the nearby Griffith University and the QEII Hospital. A key feature of this development will be safe, accessible and affordable homes for seniors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002535"></A>
We are working with a specialist design inquiry group, including the Council of the Ageing and others, to design and build high-tech homes for seniors. We are building modern, six-star energy efficient homes that are fully accessible for people with mobility issues. We will investigate the use of assistive technologies to help seniors live independently in their homes. Seniors will be just metres from public transport and other important services, making independence more manageable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002536"></A>
We are in the early planning stages, but we are determined to see this rolled out quickly to keep housing affordable and keep generating jobs for builders and tradies. By early next year we will be ready for expressions of interest from developers and by mid-next year we will start building. We have a strong policy for housing affordability in Queensland. Where is the policy from those opposite? I ask the question again: would the Coopers Plains housing development be on the chopping block of the LNP? <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.08 am): These days people are constantly bombarded by all sorts of advertising, so to cut through all this you need to bring a product front and centre into people’s minds. You cannot rely simply on traditional media and that is why Tourism Queensland is pursuing innovations such as Facebook. Tourism Queensland’s Passport to Shine Facebook campaign--it has nothing to do with the member for Toowoomba North--which I launched in the UK earlier this month is making its mark around the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002540"></A>
Since we launched the campaign in London two weeks ago, the number of connections on the Queensland Facebook page has climbed from 34,000 to more than 134,000 from 118 countries--with the highest number of entries coming from Australia, Taiwan, the US, Malaysia and the UK. As part of this campaign, Facebook’s 500 million users worldwide have the opportunity to win a Queensland holiday worth up to $100,000 for themselves and up to nine friends simply by entering their experiences into a virtual passport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003775"></A>
Passport to Shine is innovative because it attracts people from all over the world to the Queensland Facebook page and exposes them to our state’s great holiday experiences. By entering their details, Facebook users allow Tourism Queensland to talk to them about our state’s holiday options in the future. Special bonus prize weeks are taking place in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia this week, where Facebook users who enter Passport to Shine will be in the running to win other Queensland holiday prizes as well.</Hansard-Body>

While I was in the UK, I launched Tourism Queensland’s new brand, ‘Queensland--Where Australia Shines’, to an enthusiastic response. I also saw firsthand Tourism Queensland’s ongoing marketing work in the UK, where nearly $1 million worth of campaign activity is taking place in October, November and December. Tourism is a competitive industry across the world but Queensland is well served by its creative and innovative agency, Tourism Queensland. By staying ahead of the pack, we will keep attracting tourists to Queensland and protect tourism jobs through the good times and the bad.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.11 am): The Bligh government values and encourages multiculturalism in Queensland. We recognise the huge benefits that people from culturally diverse backgrounds can bring to our state. There was no better evidence of this than on Tuesday night when over 600 members of the Indian community, as well as members of the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland and members of this parliament turned out to our own Speaker’s Green to celebrate the Festival of Light. The local Indian community makes a huge contribution to Queensland’s economic, cultural and social life, and only last month I presented the Indian community with a Queensland multicultural award at our annual multicultural ceremony. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003783"></A>
We also recognise that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds face challenges when arriving in a new region. As we move towards the warmer weather, I am pleased to report to the parliament on the tremendous success of the Bligh government’s On the Same Wave program. In January this year, the tourism minister, the Minister for Sport and I announced $100,000 in funding towards a multicultural surf safety program. This program, which is run by Surf Live Saving Queensland, has resulted in more than 8,760 individuals receiving beach safety education talks, with 20,000 people being exposed to key messages through Surf Live Saving Queensland’s participation at festivals and public forums. Surf Live Saving Queensland has distributed more than 20,000 multilingual resources at these events and a further 10,000 have been distributed to other areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003788"></A>
More than 100 classroom sessions have been conducted throughout South-East Queensland, Townsville and Cairns, but we are not stopping there. I am pleased to announce that Multicultural Affairs Queensland, in conjunction with Queensland Tourism and Surf Lifesaving Queensland, is planning a Multicultural Water Safety Forum on the Gold Coast on 7 December to increase the engagement of culturally and linguistically diverse communities in water safety messages. We want to ensure that there is a very clear message to all Queenslanders, especially those in our multicultural community, to ‘swim between the flags’. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.13 am): Today I am pleased to announce $2 million in grants to show societies. This is good news for these show societies. It will ensure that these important local country events--even though they may be modest in size--can continue across Queensland, in cities and towns, small communities, far and wide. These grants are going to 129 agricultural show societies and the Rockhampton Regional Council--the only council to run a show--for events planned in 2010-11. Grants also support the Queensland Chamber of Agricultural Societies, which I have to say is ably managed by chief executive officer, Mark Bryant.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003794"></A>
Each grant varies depending on the size and location of the event. The Isis Show Society, for example, will receive $5,000, the Hughenden Show Society will receive $8,130, the Herbert River Show Society will receive $21,372, and the Gold Coast Show Society will receive an injection of $69,844. Other grant beneficiaries include the Alpha Show Society, which is getting $6,213, and the Redcliffe Agricultural, Horticultural and Industrial Society, which will receive $29,726. I am today pleased to announce ahead of this weekend’s community cabinet that the Mount Isa Agricultural Show Society will receive $19,171. These grants may go towards running the show events or they may be applied to building and maintaining show related assets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003800"></A>
I am very pleased to report that the grants--however large or small--are recognised as important by organisers. Take, for example, the Sunshine Coast Show Society--last year’s grant helped it develop an agriculture education program. Then there is the Caves Progress and Agricultural Society just outside of Rockhampton, which used its grant to upgrade the cattle arena. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003803"></A>
Annual shows are drawcards for communities. They bring old friends together as well as inspire some friendly competition. They also showcase to visitors the very rich and diverse contribution that primary industries and the agricultural sector continue to make to today’s Queensland. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the many workers behind the scenes--the show volunteers who work hard throughout the year right across Queensland to make sure the show goes on. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.16 am): Queensland scientists recently began a $930,000 three-year project to investigate a bacterial infection that has killed more than 80 giant Queensland gropers. Gropers can grow to over three metres in length and weigh in at more than 600 kilograms. They are one of the largest reef-dwelling fish in the world. This protected species is a popular tourist attraction along the North Queensland coast. Over the past few years, the bodies of these marine giants--some weighing nearly 200 kilograms--have been washed up on beaches from Weipa in Far North Queensland to Yeppoon on the Central Coast. These fish can live for a very long time. It is a sad sight to see these magnificent creatures floundering or dead in shallow waters on some of Queensland’s most popular beaches. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003809"></A>
This research project aims to shed some light on the cause and spread of this bacterial infection which to date has been a mystery to scientists and marine biologists. Investigations into the deaths will focus on how gropers became infected with the bacteria and how it spreads between fish. Tests will be conducted to determine if the disease is spread by the gropers eating contaminated food, by fish-to-fish contact or by infected waters. This research will also benefit the Queensland aquaculture industry, as the tests will be used to help diagnose aquaculture fish kills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003812"></A>
The Queensland groper is an iconic species that holds a special place in the hearts of Queenslanders so it is important that we learn all we can about what is causing these deaths. Dr Rachel Bowater, a Biosecurity Queensland veterinarian, will lead a team of some of the best veterinarians, scientists and aquaculturists in Australia. She has carried out postmortems on some groper carcasses that have already been recovered. From the samples, she has determined that many are dying from bacterial septicaemia and meningitis. This emerging bacterial disease has also been found in marine fish and stingrays. The $930,000 in funding for this project is part of Fisheries Queensland’s commitment to protecting and preserving Queensland’s valuable fisheries resource. <Hansard-Speech-End>

It is a special day set aside each year to once again celebrate our great teachers and recognise their wonderful work. Today in the House on behalf of all members I would like to get in an early ‘thank you’ to every Queensland teacher for their hard work every day to give our kids a flying start in life. In Queensland we have more than 38,000 full-time teachers working in more than 1,230 state schools across the state, and we have many thousands of teachers in the quite considerable number of non-state schools in the Catholic and independent sectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005222"></A>
While a teacher’s job can be very rewarding, the job of educating kids is a challenging one, particularly here in Queensland as we live in the most decentralised state in the country. More than half of Queensland state schools are in rural and remote communities and about 25 per cent of all state school students are enrolled at these schools. I would like to highlight the great work and dedication of our teachers working in those areas. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh government continues to support two scholarship programs designed to ensure children in rural, remote and Indigenous communities have access to quality education. The Bid O’Sullivan and the Pearl Duncan Teaching Scholarships encourage dedicated, quality teachers from diverse cultural backgrounds to work in rural and remote areas. Bid O’Sullivan was a teacher in a little bush school before the Second World War and in 1959 she pioneered the School of the Air in Cloncurry. Pearl Duncan became the first tertiary trained Aboriginal schoolteacher in Australia in 1951. These scholarships, valued at up to $20,000 each over four years, are open to students undertaking an education degree at a Queensland university. Applications are currently open for both scholarships and will close on 19 November. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005229"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to ensuring all students, no matter where they live, have access to high quality education and training. Through these scholarship programs, aspiring teachers will be supported to obtain teaching qualifications and begin their rewarding careers in Queensland schools.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Part 2A of the <Hansard-Italic>
Parliament of Queensland Act 2001</Hansard-Italic>
 establishes a statutory requirement for a Register of Members’ Interest and a Register of Related Persons’ Interest. This schedule to Standing Orders provides for the administrative arrangements for the registers and the particulars of interests that must be disclosed.<A href="#id(pgfId-1010911)" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="footnote">1</A> </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Purpose</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010958"></A>
The purpose of the Register of Members’ Interests is to place on the public record any pecuniary or other relevant interests of a member which may give rise to a conflict of interest or a perception of a conflict of interest between a member’s private interests and the public interest. The register seeks to provide information which might be thought by others to affect a member’s public duties, or to influence their speeches or votes in the Legislative Assembly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Review of Auditor-General’s reports: remote council issues</Hansard-Italic>
. Councils in remote areas of Queensland face unique challenges due to their location and low population base. This inquiry has been initiated in response to reviews conducted by the Auditor-General into the local government sector, including Aboriginal and island councils over a number of years which have identified a number of concerns.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005254"></A>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005255"></A>
The committee is seeking to actively involve remote communities and, to this end, it is now seeking public submissions from all interested parties on any aspect of the committee’s inquiry relevant to them. We encourage all members to consider and disseminate the discussion paper throughout their electorates. I commend the paper to the House.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (10.25 am): I rise to support the motion to take note of the report moved by the member for Waterford. I take this opportunity to commend the member for Waterford as chair of that committee and also all of the members of the committee for producing that report. It is extremely important that the parliament keeps its focus on issues of road safety. A couple of the recommendations did catch my eye because they were issues that were raised at the Cairns Road Safety Summit, which I convened in November of last year in response to a dreadful period on the roads in Far North Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1253190"></A>
One of the issues that was raised and is reflected in one of the recommendations of the report is the idea of rewarding Queensland drivers for good behaviour. A constituent of mine, Mr Chris Wighton, raised that issue at the Road Safety Summit. It is interesting that it has been picked up in the report of the committee. I think that that is something that is certainly worthy of further consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1253191"></A>
One of the other issues that was raised at the Road Safety Summit that is picked up in part in the report is the use to which revenues from fixed speed camera detected offences can be put. It is important to note that in Queensland the revenue from speed cameras over and above administrative costs must be used for road safety education awareness programs, road accident and injury rehabilitation programs, and road funding to improve the safety of state controlled roads. I think it is fair to say that there is a perception in some quarters in Queensland that revenue from camera detected offences goes into general revenue. I think there are some important recommendations in the report that are worthy of consideration about the further use to which revenue can be put. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005279"></A>
Happily, as at 17 October this year, the Far North regional road toll is 15 fatalities fewer than it was at the same time last year. Whilst, of course, every road fatality is a tragedy, I am hopeful that this decrease represents a sustained turnaround from last year’s trend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005280"></A>
In conclusion, I wish to again commend all of the members of the committee for producing a thoughtful and interesting report containing recommendations that I think are worthy of further consideration. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to Labor Party bagman Brendan John McKennariey, who corruptly paid off a Labor minister right under the Premier’s nose. I ask: has the Premier sought assurances from her current Labor cabinet colleagues about any dealings they had with Mr McKennariey between 2001 and 2006? Will the Premier reveal what those assurances are? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006933"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I think everybody would join with me in saying that the revelations that we have seen in the recent court case have been, frankly, sickening and appalling. The revelations that a former member of this House has been involved in something as deeply corrupt as this conviction indicates is a poor reflection on the person concerned and, frankly, shocking to those who worked in this chamber with him. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006934"></A>
In response to the member’s question, I would refer him to the evidence brought forward in the court case on a number of occasions. One of the reasons the involvement of this gentleman with the former minister was entered into in such a secretive manner was that members of the Labor cabinet, predominantly the member for Rockhampton but others, had refused to deal with this gentleman and his company. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the Minister for Public Works. As I recall, both the Minister for Public Works and the government were criticised at the time for refusing to deal with this company. In terms of any suggestion that there is any involvement, if members go and have a look at the court transcripts and the evidence brought forward by the CMC what they will--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>

My second question without notice is also to the Premier. I refer the Premier to statements made in this House by her current education minister in 2005, at the height of when Gordon Nuttall was receiving corrupt payments from Brendan John McKennariey. The Premier’s cabinet colleague admitted that he had personally opened the office of Labor bagman Brendan John McKennariey and personally congratulated the bagman and wished him great success. What can the Premier tell us about this close relationship between her current education minister and Labor’s bagman? </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I refer to my previous answer on this issue. I make the point that, as I understand it, this business is in the electorate of the member that is referred to in the member’s question. As he would know, it is not unusual for members to be invited to open or be part of these sorts of businesses in their electorate. That does not mean, and nor does it provide any evidence, that there is any business between the member for Ferny Grove and this business in his electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006948"></A>
This government has been absolutely clear in its dealings on this issue. It is absolutely clear from the evidence produced not only in this trial but also in the previous trial. In fact, the charges on which Mr Nuttall was convicted in the previous instance were receiving secret commissions. One can only be convicted of that if the court is satisfied and the jury is satisfied on the evidence that they were secret. If the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that they were not secret then he should be demanding a retrial. The government will not be. </Hansard-Body>

Mount Isa-Cloncurry, Community Cabinet</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006957"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs KIERNAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Can the Premier please inform the House about the level of interest in this weekend’s community cabinet meeting in Mount Isa and Cloncurry in the mighty electorate of Mount Isa? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006959"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the mighty member for the mighty electorate of Mount Isa for the question. As anybody knows, Betty Kiernan is a very enthusiastic member for this extraordinary electorate. I thank her for her assistance in making sure that her constituents understand the opportunity they have to meet with ministers. In fact, the very first community cabinet that I chaired as Premier in 2007 was in Mount Isa. It is the last time that the whole cabinet was there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006960"></A>
At that time, ministers held 94 separate meetings with local groups and individuals. This weekend there will be 170 deputations. So the interest has almost doubled. I think it is a huge vote of confidence in this form of grassroots consultation. This number of deputations comes on a weekend when one of the biggest events of the year is being held in Mount Isa--the region’s most prestigious fishing competition, the Lake Moondarra Classic. There is $45,000 up for grabs to someone who can snag the specially tagged barra. I wish the competitors the best of luck. I am very pleased that, even with that sort of competition, we will still see people out for a very big community cabinet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006962"></A>
I think one of the questions we can ask ourselves this week is whether community cabinets are on the chopping block of the Leader of the Opposition. How would I know the answer to this question? On Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition revealed his cunning plan. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1006963"></A>
I tell you what you do: you give me something that you want to know if--if I’ll assure that it’ll stay there and I’ll give you the answer about whether it will or not.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006964"></A>
That had an awfully familiar ring to it. I went back and looked in the history books and what did I find? During the investigations of the Fitzgerald inquiry former Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen was asked--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1006965"></A>
What do you understand by the doctrine of the separation of powers? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1006966"></A>
He said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1006967"></A>
Well you tell me. And I’ll tell you whether you’re right or not. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006968"></A>
That is straight out of the National Party playbook. But there is one fundamental flaw in the cunning plan: he cannot answer these questions at a press conference unless he has a press conference. True to prediction, there was no press conference yesterday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006969"></A>
Like thousands around the world, I was saddened yesterday to hear of the death of Paul the psychic octopus. But we do not need Paul the psychic octopus to know that there will not be a press conference today, either. No, he will be back hiding under bed saying, ‘Don’t let them find me. I don’t want to answer any questions.’ He does not know what he would cut. In that environment, we know that he will cut everything. </Hansard-Body>

 Thank you, Mr Speaker. I make the point again that probably one of the biggest defenders of Mr McKennariey and his company is in fact the member for Southern Downs and the team that he led during the time that the member for Rockhampton was terminating the contract with them. The member for Rockhampton endured weeks and months of criticism from those opposite for what? Terminating a contract with Brendan McKennariey. Who were the great defenders?</Hansard-Body>

 When a minister like the Minister for Public Works sought to terminate a contract with this company, unsatisfied with the quality of the work and having deep concerns about them, what happened? Those opposite defended them, and they defended them week in and week out, month in and month out. I say this to all of those opposite: if you believe that there are matters that have not been investigated or there are matters which should come to the attention of the CMC, you have an obligation to refer it. Why is Gordon Nuttall in the situation he is today? Because our government referred the complaints to the CMC.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1007067"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Can I just note that today an Access Economics report notes that Queensland has recorded the highest value of definite health infrastructure projects across Australia totalling $5.7 billion. This was well above other states, with the second highest value recorded by Western Australia at $3.2 billion and followed by New South Wales at $2.5 billion. Across our forward estimates period our government is building $7.33 billion worth of health infrastructure--the largest health capital program in the nation which is creating 40,000 jobs. We know with those opposite that each and every project and every job is under threat from the cape to the Gold Coast and west to Mount Isa. We know about their secret plan to cut the building program, cut jobs and cut health services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007071"></A>
We have seen a lot of discussion and decision and announcements across the other side of the chamber. On policy we saw the Leader of the Opposition on 9 July last year saying, ‘We’ll be rolling out our policies.’ Then of course on 18 September this year in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 he said, ‘We’ve got a number of initiatives. I don’t count them in terms of notating them off, but there are numerous ones.’ So a year later we have heard nothing in relation to policy. Then of course we heard about reshuffles. On 15 January this year we heard about a clean out of shadow cabinet in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
. On 23 September this year he was planning a reshuffle. We have still got members sitting on the front bench who do not occupy positions. They are still sitting there in the back still silent. Yesterday of course when asked about particular programs he would cut, the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘I’ll tell you what I will do. You give me something you want to know if I’ll assure that it will stay there and I will give the answer about whether it will or not.’ One day later there was silence--except that he had the member for Caloundra yesterday getting up there and talking about the Children’s Hospital. The first opportunity after the Leader of the Opposition was put on the map and he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1007079"></A>
The LNP will consider very closely its policy in relation to the Queensland Children’s Hospital but acknowledges the difficulty involved.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007081"></A>
So we see the member for Caloundra doing exactly what the Leader of the Opposition said they would not do. They cannot commit to it. I just say this: Douglas Adams said 42 was the secret to the universe. I say the number is 26, because everybody opposite knows that in a 26-day election campaign the Leader of the Opposition will blow up. They know it upstairs. You know it. He cannot last the 26 days. He will blow up as soon as he is put under scrutiny--and so will the member for Caloundra, as he did last time, and so will the member for Callide when he saw the member for Moggill do it as well.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Of course this parliament met and it considered the matter. What it did not do is exonerate the then member for Sandgate. In fact, the parliamentary record, as I recall, will show that this parliament resolved to admonish him for his behaviour in an estimates committee. Subsequently, when further matters were drawn to the attention of the government they were sent to the CMC for investigation. If this had happened under the National Party, which is so revered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, it would never have got to the CMC. It would have been actively covered up by the Premier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007097"></A>
Of course I recall the words that I said on that day. Do I regret them? Of course I do, because when I made them I had no idea of the sort of activities that this person was up to. As I outlined earlier, he is in jail because he has been convicted of receiving secret commissions. By definition--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 By definition Mr Nuttall could not be in jail if it had not been produced in evidence that he had secretly covered up his activities. It is the secrecy of his activities that brought him into the problem that he is in. The very matter that has been considered by the privileges committee of this parliament is that he failed to declare when he should have declared. The courts have heard evidence now over the last couple of weeks of further cover-ups. This entire saga has come to pass because this was secret, it was covert, it was covered up by everybody involved in it. So did I know about it? No, I did not and, as I said yesterday, I am sickened and appalled that as people sat around a cabinet table, believing that they were sitting with someone genuine, they were being so deceived. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mount Ommaney for her question and for her support for this government to continue to put jobs into the Queensland economy through its commitment to funding a $17 billion building program--a $17 billion building program that is supporting 100,000 jobs around this state, 100,000 jobs that would not be there if this government had taken the decision to stop the building program, to turn up on work sites and turn off the bulldozers, to withdraw our support and to do what those opposite would have done and that is to cut the capital program. The risk to the capital program, the risk to the Queensland economy, the risk to jobs in the Queensland economy sits on the other side of the chamber. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011413"></A>
Of course, what we have seen during this week is a number of recommendations on the economic recovery in this state. Today, we see in Access Economics’ <Hansard-Italic>
investment monitor</Hansard-Italic>
 that investment--public and private--in Queensland is up. It was $31 billion higher in the last quarter--up to 20 per cent. Where is that on a year ago? It is $51 billion higher than it was a year go. That is up 38 per cent. Of all private investment around the nation, Queensland has had the second highest increase, with $124 billion of known investment. That is $100 billion ahead of the next placed state, Victoria--$100 billion ahead of where Victoria is. That is because of the economic policies that this government is pursuing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011415"></A>
But, of course, what we are seeing opposite is a commitment to engage in a capital ‘Kill Bill’--they would take out the sword to the capital program. The Leader of the Opposition has invited the media to participate with him in some sort of evil bingo where you get to nominate the projects that get knocked off. We know, of course, from this week that a tory is a tory, because if you look across the waters to the UK you see that they have just abolished as part of their cuts the Infrastructure Planning Commission. That would be a pursuit that the Leader of the Opposition would love, because he has abolished the shadow infrastructure and planning minister. After so long has he had the time to replace him? Of course he has. So instead of sitting under a desk with the thumb in, cuddling the teddy bear, it is about time he got around to appointing a shadow minister for infrastructure and planning. We know that while he has been sulking a few others have been sulking as well. A few of them have that old sinking feeling. The old déjà vu is coming back. They think they just might be, once again, ‘Flegging’ a dead horse. While they are ‘Flegging’ the dead horse over there, they have seen it happen to the member for Southern Downs, who could not explain the cuts. They have seen the Leader of the Opposition do it. Finally we know. On this side: jobs--100,000 jobs in a building program, a jobs target of 100,000, more than halfway to it, and on the other side, cuts to jobs, cuts to the capital program, cuts to public services. The choice is now clear. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. I refer to seminars given by Queensland Health to various unions and staff on the contents of the latest Ernst and Young report into the payroll debacle. Is it correct that the report states that it may take up to three years to fix this diabolical payroll system? </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for taking an interest in the Health payroll into the third day of this sitting week. It speaks volumes about their interest in relation to these matters. I make this point and I make this point quite clearly: I have indicated to people that we will release this report, as we have released all other reports, when it has been considered and has been the subject of consultation.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have repeatedly made it clear that we want to have the system stabilised and working effectively. I have also made it clear that I see the process of payroll as one of continuous improvement. We know that the previous system was not perfect. We know that there were overpayments with the previous system. This is about making sure that the new system is as accurate as possible as soon as possible, that it retains the benefits of personal service which we have rolled out in terms of that model, and also making sure we can do that in the longer term. We will continue to consult with the unions. Like all other reports, we are more than happy to release it in due course and that it be the subject of debate. The honourable member can do that and make whatever assertions he wants. I see the question of payroll, like any software, as being something of long-term and continued improvement over an indefinite period of time. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. On 15 July 1996 BHF Australia Ltd, owned by Brendan McKennariey, submitted a proposal to the then director-general, Kevin Davies, to manage the backflow prevention program at a whole-of-government level. The rest, as they say, is history. Who is this Brendan McKennariey? Brendan McKennariey was then working for one Mick Veivers, who was the emergency services minister. That is who Brendan McKennariey is. </Hansard-Body>

How could this great Labor bloke have ended up on the staff of a cabinet minister in the National Party? I still do not know the answer to that. But guess what else happened? There was a bloke called Graham Doyle, also a member of the Labor Party, who was pushed into this backflow unit over at the Department of Public Works when the tories were in, when Borbidge was in--when you were a cabinet minister in that government </Hansard-Body>

The honourable member who just interjected, the member for Callide, was the one who got up and asked the question in defence of McKennariey over that incident. I remember it very well. So do not come in here with your mealy-mouthed, high posturing and this nonsense because you gave these people a job, and when they were plundering over in the public works department on your watch I put an end to it.

If we had not won government in 1998 this rort would have continued. It was a rort that went by McKennariey.

When I shut it down, I put it before the honourable member who was then in charge of the public works committee to find out whether there was any evidence whatsoever to convince people--which he had done to those opposite; he had convinced all of you people over there and that grub Mike Munro--that backflow killed people.

 You can come in here and defame these people if you like. I do not even know who they are. They are obviously contractors who have some expertise and they get paid the going rate. The suggestion you are making is that you would leave the thing unfixed, that some divine intervention will prevail and as a result it will be fixed. Of course you have to get contractors in to fix it. If you do not know that much I do not know what sort of a government you will make. I could get a fair idea, given your defence this morning of Brendan McKennariey. I have a fair idea, having seen what you did in relation to backflow, of just how crooked you lot would be if you ever got back into government. Just a couple of weeks ago the honourable member said that you should always take the lowest price. I think that is how McKennariey got the job. </Hansard-Body>

They just worked out how to get free money out of workers in this state. As far as I am concerned, that is the lowest thing I can think of that any Labor minister or any Labor person could do. What he actually did was recycle money into the pockets of Nuttall and McKennariey out of workplace health and safety. In reality, we get an indication from those who sit opposite today when they talk about this payroll matter. What would they have us do? Leave the thing just sit there? Don’t fix it? </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for his question and for his support of the Queensland Police Service. Last Friday I had the pleasure of being at a police graduation, where 45 new recruits were inducted into the service. Four of those recruits are going into the member’s electorate in the Cairns area and others will be spread across the state. To list them, there will be four into Rockhampton, eight into Metro North, three into Oxley, four into South Brisbane, two into Wynnum, eight into the Sunshine Coast, six into the south-east, one into Roma and five into the Toowoomba district. This will take the Police Service strength to around 10,500 police officers. </Hansard-Body>

This government went to the election with a commitment to increase police numbers by around 600 over this term.

Yesterday or the day before we saw the Leader of the Opposition stand and tell the people of Queensland through the media that he was going to tell us what will stay and what will go. If he has any guts as a leader he will stand up now and tell us what will stay and what will go, particularly in the police and emergency services portfolio. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Health.

 It alleges no instances, Mr Speaker. What it said was that requiring him and his team, in his opinion, to adhere to what he was required to do could constitute that--not ‘This is what happened.’ But of course, having the letter, the honourable member would not actually want to say what the letter says. It does not allege one instance. In fact, if you are a senior manager in Queensland Health and you are party to that, it is incumbent upon you to act on it. That is why it does not allege it. We treat it very, very seriously. It is very easy for my director-general to dismiss that when there is no allegation of a specific instance made in that letter and, as far as I am aware, none that the manager in question ever referred for action. So I thank the member for Clayfield for being typically uninformed on these issues. </Hansard-Body>

Yesterday, when it came to the remarkable performance from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Callide was at high noon. </Hansard-Body>

We remember the Mundingburra MOU when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was around the cabinet table when they did a deal with the Police Union to scuttle the CMC. We remember Connolly-Ryan. We remember when former Liberal member of parliament Peter Connolly said, ‘We’ll see how their little experiment of the CJC goes,’ in the light of what he was doing and got struck off for ostensible bias in the Supreme Court. There is one side of politics that has the runs on the board. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew everything about Joh when he came in here and called him his mentor. He knew he had faced a perjury charge when he called him a mentor. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member very much for his question. Of course we all know that this government is investing record funding into disability services--$1.6 billion in disability services and home and community care services right across this state. Today I am also pleased to announce that we have allocated the $40 million for young people with a disability leaving school for the next financial year. As part of that, we allocated an additional $4 million to help approximately an extra 300 school leavers right across this state. This funding is benefiting young people with a disability who are leaving school to gain opportunities in employment, in education and in training. It is being utilised in every seat right across this state. So not only do members of this side benefit but members of that side benefit as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I am very concerned. I am very concerned about what could happen if the other side got into power. We have seen what has happened in other parts of Australia and also in other parts of the world. I was very disturbed to see that in the UK recently the first thing to get cut when the opposition gets into power is those services that protect the most vulnerable in our community. </Hansard-Body>

Cross River Rail</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011675"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Transport. Can the minister outline to the House how Cross River Rail will benefit Queenslanders? Are there any risks to its continuation? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011677"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will. I thank the honourable member for the question. Cross River Rail is an enormously significant public transport project for all of South-East Queensland. It will very significantly expand the capacity of the rail network, particularly on the Gold Coast line and across the Merivale Street bridge and through the middle of Brisbane, where capacity constraints are emerging. It will give Brisbane for the first time an underground rail network, like the metros of the world cities that Brisbane aspires to be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011679"></A>
It is an enormous project which is 100 per cent supported by this government, which is doing the planning work in partnership with the federal government. I would have thought that all political leaders would support such a critical project for our public transport future. Indeed, I thought we were getting that support. Just a few weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition indicated that it was his view that it was the highest priority project for South-East Queensland--albeit, when he said it, he was ‘backdooring’ the member for Maroochydore on the way through because he was comparing it to the Redcliffe rail project which she has put on a slightly higher platform. Unfortunately, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane seems to hold a different view. On Saturday, in what Channel 9 described as ‘a savage attack’, the Lord Mayor launched into Cross River Rail, describing the project as too expensive and as destroying character housing on the south side of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011681"></A>
So I think the question for this House is: what is the real LNP position on this project? The member for Maroochydore seems to think it lies somewhere behind Redcliffe rail. Her leader, the Leader of the Opposition, has described it quite unequivocally as the highest priority project for the south-east. But down at City Hall, the Lord Mayor has described it as too expensive in ‘a savage attack’ and as destroying character housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011683"></A>
The question for us is: will the Leader of the Opposition stand up to the Lord Mayor on this one? Does he really think this is so critical that he should in fact assume a leadership position within his party? Or will his leadership be wavering and unpredictable, as has so often been the case? The Leader of the Opposition has an obligation to the people of South-East Queensland to seek to bring the Lord Mayor into line over this one and to stand up for what is best for all of South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Bruce Highway, Cooroy-Curra Upgrade</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011689"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Main Roads. The Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway remains a constant frustration with the speed being limited to 90 kilometres an hour. I asked a question in parliament on 25 November 2009 as to whether there have been any demonstrable decreases in statistics; it is my understanding there has not. Will the minister, in light of those statistics, consider reinstating it to 100 kilometres an hour?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011691"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Maryborough for the question, and the short answer is, yes, we will look at that suggestion. I want to thank him for constantly keeping me informed about what is happening on that section of road. As he and other members of the House would know--the member for Gympie would certainly know--that section of road was rated as the most dangerous section of the Bruce Highway in Queensland, indeed one of the most dangerous sections of road in Australia. That is why I welcomed that funding commitment from the Labor government in Canberra, which we have joined--over $600 million on that first section of road to do Cooroy to Curra. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011692"></A>
I do not make the decisions in terms of safety and the speed limits. That is a decision made by engineers in my department, the department of transport, and we work very, very closely with the Queensland Police Service. There have been a number of serious accidents on that section of road, and that is why the decision was made to reduce speed limits by 10 kilometres in late 2008 but we will certainly take that suggestion on board. The other thing we have done on that section of road--and the member for Maryborough would certainly be aware of this--is that we have installed six VMS signs to help motorists through that section of road if there is congestion or an accident. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011694"></A>
How did the Bruce Highway get to this state? It was caused by chronic underfunding of the Bruce Highway by the Howard government for over a decade. Let us look at the record of the Howard government. It provided $825 million for the Bruce Highway in its last five years--compare that to Labor’s $2.6 billion for the Bruce Highway. That is why I was so gobsmacked last week when I was told by my department that a Queensland Liberal senator--Senator Ian Macdonald--phoned a Main Roads staffer not once but twice to complain about roadworks on the Bruce Highway rolling out around Townsville. He told the staffer he was having a bad day and he wanted her to have one too. Shame on him! As the Treasurer has said and as we say: a tory is a tory, they don’t change their spots. They will attack roadworkers across the state. They will attack roadworkers trying to fix up the Bruce Highway after a decade of neglect by the Howard government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011697"></A>
I will come into this place and I will defend roadworkers day after day. I say to Senator Ian Macdonald: you are lower than a snake’s belly for attacking my roadworkers. These are good men and women who are trying to fix up the mess on the roads--just like at Cooroy to Curra and just like those sections south of Townsville. I make no apologies for what we are doing on the roads across Queensland. We will work with Labor in Canberra to fix up Cooroy to Curra and we will work with Labor in Canberra to fix up the roads across this state.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. The state government allocated $7 million to upgrade and refurbish the Whitsunday Airport.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HINCHLIFFE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank the member for Whitsunday for a question. She has been an avid campaigner for this. This was an election commitment made by the Bligh government during the election campaign and this is evidence of us delivering--delivering on jobs, not cuts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011708"></A>
I am pleased to advise the whole of the House that not only has the successful tenderer for the refurbishment and extension been selected, that is TF Woollam and Son Pty Ltd, but also the contractor’s works have begun. They are underway. This is yet another great example of the Bligh government standing up for jobs, not cuts, in our regions. Our priority has always been to protect jobs to build a stronger Queensland economy, and here we are delivering for the Whitsunday region, delivering for the tourism industry, delivering for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011712"></A>
As I said, the contract for the upgrade works has been awarded to TF Woollam and Son. They bring 20 construction jobs and abundant opportunities to local businesses. I encourage local businesses in the region to get on board and look to what they can do to be part of the story about delivering this $7 million renovation. It is obviously a great investment in the region and we will see flow-on benefits for the whole of the tourism industry for decades to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011713"></A>
This is clearly evidence of our commitment to delivering what we committed to--to delivering jobs, not cuts. There is $17.1 billion in our infrastructure program this year alone on top of $18 billion last year and $16 billion the year before. This shows that we have an economic plan that is about delivering for Queensland--delivering jobs, delivering to our regions--and ensuring that we take the response that was required to the global financial circumstances in which we found ourselves. What is the alternative? We could go through a pick-a-box process with the Leader of the Opposition to find out whether this or that is going to be cut. </Hansard-Body>

 As I say, I can now expose the fraudulent nature of the question. The suggestion in the question was that while nurses were not getting paid these people were. The reality is that the documents explain the need to continue an arrangement--a contract--for two individuals who were involved in the implementation of the program. Why? The answer is that the program did not go live in December 2009; it went live in March 2010, which is a well-known fact. Why did it not go live in 2009? Because it was not ready to go live. That was the advice to the state. </Hansard-Body>

 These people were employed to continue the contract when the go-live date was moved from December to March. For them not to be employed would have meant that whatever changes had to be made to the system could not be made. So the Associate Director-General, Natalie MacDonald, signed off on 8 December on the contract being re-extended. That is all the matter relates to. It is simply a matter of identifying that the project was going to go on longer. Therefore, the costs were going to be more and, as a result, these people would have to be paid. I do not set the rates at which these people get paid. That is a matter for the market. There is nothing untoward whatsoever in that matter. <Hansard-Speech-End>

This amendment deletes clause 6 and replaces it with a proposed new section to add grandparent carers to section 9, ‘Obligation of public authorities to consider carers charter’. It adds a new subclause, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1016050"></A>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016052"></A>
This amendment seeks to include the Grandparent Carers Charter in addition to the Carers Charter. The addition is to ensure that both charters have a role in policy making. It is intended to give them a greater priority than a simple tool of recognition. It is a follow-through of the intended process relating to all the amendments that the grandparents charter is acknowledged alongside the Carers Charter in all of these particularly significant parts. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government will be opposing the opposition’s amendments. The amendments proposed to this clause as suggested by the member for Burdekin would reflect the separate recognition of the grandparent carers charter that would, in addition to the Queensland Carers Charter, have to be taken into consideration by public authorities and human resource policies and reflect the separate recognition of grandparent carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016057"></A>
In response to that, I say that currently under the existing act public authorities must ensure they consult with representative bodies when making strategic policy or planning decisions relevant to carers and the people they care for. The government bill adds an additional obligation providing that public authorities must ensure that human resource policies are developed taking into consideration the Queensland Carers Charter. </Hansard-Body>

Amendment 6 deletes clause 7 and replaces it. With this amendment, section 10, ‘Reporting obligations’, will have an additional provision, that is, that a report under this section must be accompanied by a report detailing all consultation for each strategic policy or planning decision in compliance with section 9(3). This provision is intended to ensure transparent compliance with the need to consult representatives of carers and grandparent carers. This is a replacement for the original clause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016097"></A>
It is very important that significant information is obtained from the actual stakeholders. The major concern is that the process is transparent and that the stakeholders--that is, the grandparent carers and the carers--have input into all policy making, strategic planning and decisions that are made that will affect them or their charges, the people that they may be caring for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016098"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government will be opposing the amendment because we believe that at the moment the reporting requirements that we have under the Carers (Recognition) Act are quite detailed. I would like to advise the House that currently all public authorities must include in their annual report certain information about how they have complied with the obligations in the act to consult with representative bodies when making policy and planning decisions relevant to carers. This requirement would mean detailing who they have consulted with on each occasion in their annual report. The reporting requirements under the Carers (Recognition) Act 2008 are already very comprehensive. I see that there is no reason to add an extra reporting requirement. </Hansard-Body>

 In relation to the opposition’s amendment, we have already voted on the proposed amendment to include an additional charter, the Grandparents Carers Charter. These consequential amendments cannot be supported. The government bill extends the role of the Carers Advisory Council to grandparent carers by virtue of the amendment of the definition of carer to include grandparent carers. As discussed previously, two new principles have been added to the charter to specifically recognise grandparent carers. I have spoken with the Queensland carers council, as has my parliamentary secretary, the member for Mount Ommaney, about these amendments.</Hansard-Body>

Amendment No. 8 deletes part of clause 8 to state that under section 14 of the act the new membership of the Carers Advisory Council should be 11. I move on to amendments Nos 9 and 10. The existing arrangement under the original bill is that the membership shall be 10 members--four public servants, three carers and three carer representatives. The government’s amendment has made this four public servants, three carers, three carers representatives but only two grandparent carer representatives. That is a little bit disappointing for the grandparent carers. Their representation is not as high as the carers’ representation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016116"></A>
The amendments that I am proposing here will actually bring the council numbers down to 11. We are proposing that the council comprise two public servants, three carers, three grandparent carers--as are currently there--and three grandparent carer representatives. This will ensure that grandparents have similar representation to the carers. I believe that is totally fair. It is reducing the number of public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016117"></A>
This is the area where the government should be looking for input from the sector--from the stakeholders, from the people who really matter, from the people who are on the ground and have the understanding. That is why we propose that the need for public servants is not as great. Having four public servants we believe is an imbalance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016118"></A>
What we are looking for is much greater representation for the people who really understand. The council is about carers and grandparent carers; it is not about the Public Service. It is important, I believe, that we have equal representation for grandparent carers and carers. Under our amendments the carers and the grandparent carers will have parallel charters with equal strength and therefore their representation on the council should be equal. They are two distinct groups and neither should assume priority over the other, just as their concerns in the charters need to be separate and distinct. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1016119"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I want to make some comments so the House is very aware of what is happening here. When I sat down after doing my reply last night the opposition sought to circulate a large number of amendments in the House. These amendments had not been seen by members of the government. I do not know whether they were seen by the Independents. These are substantially different amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016120"></A>
What I say to the opposition is that it would have been appreciated if we could have had some discussion about these or if it could have tabled them beforehand so members on both sides of the House could have had the opportunity to examine the amendments in detail and make comments in detail. I do not think that is being respectful to the members of this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016121"></A>
What is now being proposed is making substantial changes to the membership of the council. What we on this side of the House have done is we have actually gone out and consulted extensively. The stakeholders are happy with the composition of the council. What I would like to do is go through these amendments in detail for the benefit of the House now that I have had time overnight to examine these amendments, so we are very clear what we are voting on here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016122"></A>
The member for Burdekin’s amendment No. 8 relating to membership seeks to amend the total number of members of the Carers Advisory Council. The government bill increases the council from 10 to 12 members as it adds a grandparent carer and a grandparent carer representative to the three carer representatives and the four public servants. The opposition’s amendment seeks to have 11 members in total. This would include two public servants and three grandparent carers in addition to three carers and three carer representatives. With the addition of a grandparent carer and a representative of grandparent carers, I believe the composition of the Carers Advisory Council is indeed appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016160"></A>
Currently the Carers Council consists of 10 members in total. This is made up of three carer members, three members who are representative of carers associations and four public servant employees. With the addition of the grandparent carer and a representative of grandparent carers, there will be 12 in total. I think that this is an adequate mix of carers, members of associations representative of carers’ interests and public servants. There is an incredible wealth of knowledge and experience between the members of the council, and the addition of the grandparent carer and a representative of grandparent carers will result in a well-balanced council that will be perfectly placed to understand the challenges faced by carers on a daily basis. As I said at the beginning, we believe that the composition is adequate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016164"></A>
With regard to the public servants, it is very important that public servants continue on this council because they have to implement the charter and make sure that their agencies are complying, and this is an issue that the Independents raised. The member for Nicklin and the member for Maryborough raised this issue. It is very important for them that public servants are acting in relation to this charter to ensure that these grandparent carers will now get the information that they require. The current representatives represent the key portfolios that play a significant and positive role in the provision of carer services in Queensland, and they are Education, Health, Justice and Attorney-General, and Communities. All members here would agree with me that it is very important to have the most senior representatives of these agencies represented on the council.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016166"></A>
When we spoke to the Carers Council about this issue it was very clear that it did not want a very large council and that it wanted to keep the composition to a minimum increase. I think the government has struck the right balance here. We have consulted. The Independents would agree with me that it is very important to have the public servants on the council to carry out the implementation. Therefore, the government will not accept the opposition amendments that were tabled for the first time last night when I sat down after giving my reply to the comprehensive debate that we had in this chamber.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for those comments, but there are a couple of things that I want to draw to her attention. First of all, the suggestion we are making is for a smaller council and not a larger council, and the minister spoke about a larger council. The reason the amendments were tabled late is that, as the minister would realise, the majority of these amendments were part of my original private member’s bill. The majority of them were from that bill and, because that bill was still alive, it was impossible for me to actually move--</Hansard-Body>

 Yes, most of them, and it was impossible to put those amendments in the public arena by that stage. That is why these amendments were not released, but there again under the circumstances it was the government’s decision to make this a cognate bill. That is why it became very difficult and that is what created the difficulties.</Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (12.01 pm): My question to the minister in relation to clause 9 of the bill is that proposed point 11 of the charter provides access to information for grandparents. I understand from the clarification provided by the minister to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee that the information that will be made available to grandparent carers will be of a general nature that is already publicly available. So in effect the bill gives grandparent carers access to general information that they already have access to. Can the minister please advise the House what this bill will achieve additionally for grandparents in terms of access to information when they become grandparent carers? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016203"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank the shadow minister for his interest in this very important issue. I think he might recall that in my summing-up I addressed this question quite comprehensively. One of the main ways in which these newly recognised grandparent carers will be able to access more information is through Carers Queensland. Carers Queensland has a great lot of resources. I have visited their premises. They will be able to provide these grandparent carers with information about services that are available locally in their communities and also information in relation to counselling. Carers Queensland has said to us that they will try to keep a list of how many of these grandparent carers are contacting them for information. I have said quite publicly that if they need some extra funding to cater for this new group that is being added to our carers recognition charter the government is prepared to give them that extra funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016206"></A>
This funding comes on top of the extra funding that I announced last week as part of Queensland Carers Week, which was very well attended right across the state. The member for Albert ran a fantastic Carers Recognition Awards ceremony in her local community and I spoke to many grandparent carers there. They explained to me the issues that they have to deal with on an ongoing basis. Some of the extra $2.5 million that we will provide over three years will also be used right across Queensland to connect different carers groups together to share their experiences and to give them the extra resources that they need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016209"></A>
The one issue that carers across-the-board raise with me as I travel around the state is respite. I think all members would agree with me that respite is very important. Through my portfolio we have large contributions of respite, not just through the disability component of my portfolio but also through Home and Community Care. My aim is to increase respite services right across this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016211"></A>
The other avenue through which we can provide assistance is my own department, which has the Office for Carers, which is there to assist people. We would be more than happy to point people in the right direction in relation to information that they need in fulfilling their caring role for their grandchildren. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016213"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for her response. Once again in terms of point 11 of the charter which provides access to information for grandparents, I ask the minister to clarify, in relation to the response that was forwarded to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, that information provided to grandparent carers when they become a carer for their grandchild would be of a general nature that is already publicly available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016214"></A>
I note that the minister outlined that grandparent carers would be eligible to access information, either through Carers Queensland or through the Office for Carers within Disability and Care Services, relating to the delivery of support services provided in local communities and the delivery of counselling services provided in local communities. But my specific question--the question that I asked very clearly previously--is: what information would be additionally available to grandparent carers that is not already publicly available to them at this point in time? What additional information would be available to grandparent carers as a result of them becoming the carers for their grandchild? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016216"></A>
Information about support services locally and information about counselling services locally is available publicly at this point in time. So from what I can see in the bill, the provisions of clause 9 that we are talking about now do not provide any additional information whatsoever to a grandparent carer when they become a carer for their grandchild. They will simply have continuing access to information that is currently available to them publicly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016217"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will be very brief. The one issue that grandparent carers who look after their grandchildren full time and who are the day-to-day decision makers often raise with members of parliament and with members of the community is that they do not know where to go for information. So we have responded by saying, ‘Now you can go to Carers Queensland to get the information that you need.’ So it is about providing that extra assistance to help them in their caring role.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016218"></A>
Consistent with principle 11, the government already provides information, in conjunction with Lifeline, to assist grandparents raising grandchildren by way of the grandparents information line. This includes general information about carer support issues, access to legal advice, accommodation issues and financial matters. So now, under this new recognition, grandparents who are coming into members’ electorate offices or going into Centrelink to ask for advice for Commonwealth assistance will be able to be referred to Carers Queensland so that they can get the information and advice that they need. I think it is very important that we provide that information to them to support them in their caring role. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016251"></A>
This amendment deletes the whole of the amended clause 9 included in the government amendment bill. The government amendment bill amends the schedule, the Queensland Carers Charter, and inserts the two principles relating to grandparent carers to the original carers charter. Clause 9 is the government’s contribution to the grandparents, shall we say, and clause 11 actually deletes that and inserts the charter that I will talk about when I get to the next amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016252"></A>
Firstly, though, I would like to agree with the member for Hinchinbrook about access to information. I spoke about this at length last night. It is referring to information that is already available. I certainly commend the minister for the efforts that the government has put into acknowledging the grandparents and the carers. It is excellent that these now do exist. Certainly some years ago they did not. It is very good that there is recognition of our carers. Hopefully we will be getting more recognition for our grandparent carers. I think we have been playing with words in this area because this is information that is available and they are able to access it. The processes are there, the government departments are there, the carers organisations are there. I have no doubt that the people in need of the information are able to access it. We are still a little bit intrigued about this extra information that would be available only to them but not available to somebody else, which is what this tends to imply. This particular amendment is just deleting clause 9. </Hansard-Body>

Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think we are going over the same ground. The government will oppose the opposition’s amendment. I think I have fully covered that under the new charter principle that access to information is very important. What this gives grandparent carers who look after their grandchildren full time and who are the primary decision makers is, for the first time, basically a one-stop shop. They will be able to go to Carers Queensland to get that information. I take on board the member for Burdekin’s comments that there is information out there. Yes, I do agree. But these grandparent carers have said they do not know where to go to get the information and this will make it easier for them. Sometimes government can be a bit of a maze for people to navigate their way through. The Office of Carers and Carers Queensland will now make it easier for these grandparent carers to get the information that they need. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016260"></A>
Amendment 12 actually inserts the most important part of the amendments that I have circulated. That is, of course, inserting a separate charter for Queensland grandparent carers. This is the same as existed in my original private member’s bill which, of course, was debated cognately and has been transferred across as an amendment to this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016261"></A>
I am disappointed that the government is not supporting this amendment. The LNP wants to see grandparent carers being given the same status as other carers. We do not believe that two extra points put on the end of the carers charter really gives these people the recognition they deserve. Their needs are vastly different--we have talked about that at length during the debate--but they do deserve the same amount of recognition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016262"></A>
To that extent, I will outline the 10 points contained in the charter for the benefit of the House. The charter states that the parliament recognises that grandparents who are providing full-time care for their grandchildren make a significant contribution to the lives of their grandchildren and that they deserve respect and support for their roles. The 10 points of the charter are: the state recognises the effort and dedication of grandparents in our community and the vital community service they perform; the state recognises that grandparents who provide full-time care to their grandchildren are primary caregivers and deserve the same rights as other primary caregivers; the relationship between grandparent and grandchild should be honoured and respected; grandparents providing full-time care to their grandchildren should be respected by our community and supported by all levels of government, institutions and organisations; the views and needs of grandparents providing full-time care to their grandchildren should be taken into account, together with the views, needs and best interests of their grandchildren, when making decisions that may affect either the grandchild or the ability of the grandparent to provide full-time care; grandparents should be recognised for the unique knowledge, love and experience they contribute to their grandchildren’s growth through formative years; the state recognises that a lone grandparent who single-handedly provides full-time care to a grandchild faces additional difficulties and deserves specific recognition; ageing and senior grandparents should be recognised for both the specific sacrifices they make and the additional difficulties they face in providing support and stability in the lives of their grandchildren; younger grandparents who assume responsibility for the primary care of their grandchildren deserve recognition for their vital service to the community and the nurture and love they provide to their grandchildren; other non-parent family members who assume responsibility for the primary care of a child should be recognised for the dedication they show and the effort they make to care for the best interests of the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016263"></A>
I want to qualify a couple of points. In the original grandparents charter that came under the seniors recognition bill, it was pointed out that perhaps younger grandparents were being disadvantaged. This is why an extra point is put in here about the younger grandparents. We have also brought in other non-parent family members who assume responsibility for primary care. In many cases they can be an aunt or a great-aunt. In fact, I am currently trying to assist a poor lady in a very sad situation.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to the member for Burdekin’s comments, as I have stated previously, the government bill does not include a separate grandparents charter. The existing carers charter in the Carers (Recognition) Act will also apply to grandparent carers. Many of the principles in the existing charter are also applicable to grandparent carers, which I think is very important to point out to the House. In addition, the government bill seeks to add two new principles specifically in relation to grandparent carers. I think they are important. I will read them out again for the benefit of the House: grandparents who are carers for their grandchildren after having raised their own children should be supported in their important and challenging role; secondly, grandparents who are carers for their grandchildren need easy access to information that is clear and relevant to their role as carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016266"></A>
Unfortunately, the shadow minister’s amendments are seeking to identify different types of grandparent carers. I think that is inevitably exclusive. To go back to a comment that the member made earlier that her amendment is exactly the same as what was originally circulated in the opposition’s bill, I point out to the House that I have gone through the bill and where there were six points, in her amendments now she is actually raising 10 points. It is a substantial addition that was only circulated last night at about nine o’clock. So the government will be opposing the opposition amendments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for being so patient through all of this. It is a very difficult bill. I have some serious issues that I would like to raise. I would like to endorse the comments made by the shadow minister. I have actually felt so strongly about this that I have come into this House to discuss this. I do not believe that the department understands the problem that has been consistently raised. This amendment is critical because it defines the grandparents’ role and it clearly establishes that which the department does not want to acknowledge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016297"></A>
I need to point out that grandparents are basically an intervention expert because they have been parents themselves. They have special skills. They are experienced. They are available. They are willing and they are related. We do need to clarify their special skills. I am having a lot of difficulty understanding why, on the one hand, the government would do anything for one parent group in a variety of other departments and then not for a group of grandparents who are only really one small step away from the same role. It does not follow. I think it is actually a flawed strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016298"></A>
The best aspect about having a charter is--and this is a point that I raised in the briefing with the minister. I said that I am a GP and I get the problem, and I can give a hundred examples. In these areas the minister needs to understand that there are a hundred examples. We have a whole lot of bills at the moment being discussed that talk about exceptional circumstances and we are defining what these exceptional circumstances are. The great beauty of what is being raised here is that it is defining all of those clear roles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016299"></A>
What the minister has just raised--and I do not want to criticise the minister--is the idea of using the generic classification. The generic classification under these circumstances is a flawed strategy. There is plenty of evidence in medical terms where you do not use generic terms. You specify because that is the way to do it. The great beauty here is that in 10 steps what we have is a clear step forward. I will not go through each one of them, but I will talk about some of them because I have a few points to raise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016300"></A>
I want to take the minister back to the issue where she said that you can just refer back to Carers Queensland and they will answer all of your questions. I would like to know what sort of budget the minister has provided them, what information these people are going to have with regard to grandparents, what changes are we going to see for Carers Queensland with regard to grandparents--</Hansard-Body>

 We can agree to disagree over certain points. I want to say that there are some good points in this amendment. The issue of the lone grandparent who single-handedly provides full-time care to a grandchild faces difficulty and deserves specific recognition. This is an important point. A lot of grandmothers are widows and divorcees and are providing these kinds of services to children. People need to recognise that. It is common. It is very, very common. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Brisbane Central obviously has some good points. Let us bring them up. The other thing is that we need to understand that grandparents are really only one step away from parents. They are interventional experts and we need to recognise that. By specifying it and not using the generic classification, we give this bill power, and that is what we should be doing. I think it is a great step that has been initiated here today, and I strongly urge the minister to endorse it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Gaven can have his own medical interpretations here, but I am actually using the legal definition. What the opposition bill does is seek to be very prescriptive. What tends to happen from a legal interpretation is that if you are very prescriptive there is every chance that you are going to exclude so many other relationships and so many particular groups of grandparents. </Hansard-Body>

I have gone extensively through how much funding we are giving to Carers Queensland. I have gone extensively through how much additional funding I have given in Carers Week last week. I do not want to go over ground that I have gone over many times before. The government will be opposing the opposition’s amendment because we believe that the Carers Charter is sufficient in that it covers a lot of aspects in relation to grandparent carers, but we are also adding two extra clauses which, through our consultations, have been supported. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (12.34 pm), continuing: In continuing my speech on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill, I would like to bring to the attention of this place the good work of Heather Steinberg. Heather Steinberg is a Gympie solicitor, former police prosecutor, community activist and passionate advocate for children, especially those children who have suffered child sex abuse. I believe that Heather is a possible candidate for membership of the Sentencing Advisory Council and would be a great choice. Heather has shared with me her thoughts and observations on this legislation which I will bring to the attention of the House. In his speech, the minister said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021108"></A>
The bill provides that an offender convicted of an offence of a sexual nature committed in relation to a child must serve an actual term of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances in the case.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1021109"></A>
In reply to that, Heather commented--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021111"></A>
When a person commits an offence against a child there should be no exceptional circumstances warranting a term of no imprisonment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021112"></A>
Offences involving boyfriend/girlfriend of similar ages should be a separate offence to avoid coming under this provision thereby allowing for all sex offenders against a child receiving an actual term of imprisonment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021113"></A>
I think that is an eminently sensible suggestion on Heather’s behalf. By splitting those offences and creating a separate offence involving a boyfriend and girlfriend of similar ages, we could make sure there is no offence whatsoever for which there would be no imprisonment. In the minister’s speech he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021115"></A>
Judicial discretion is retained, but it will only be where it can be demonstrated that the most extraordinary circumstances exist that an offender may be sentenced to anything other than an actual term of imprisonment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1021116"></A>
Mrs Steinberg commented--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021118"></A>
The problem with judicial discretion being retained is what is currently seen now--the offenders are not given actual terms of imprisonment, more attention is paid to the defence solicitor then the victim and the prosecutor. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021119"></A>
The discretion should be taken out of their hands and the decision be made mandatory.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021120"></A>
Defence solicitors will always come up with a way to claim the matter is “extraordinary circumstance” to prevent his/her client from getting an actual jail term.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1021121"></A>
The minister also said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021123"></A>
The result of this amendment is that the court will increase the penalty to be given to the offender within the established common law sentencing range for that conduct. The penalty must, however, still be proportionate to the gravity of the current offence.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1021124"></A>
Heather commented--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021126"></A>
This is what is supposed to happen now with the judicial system--the penalty is increased each time the offender comes before the court. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021127"></A>
However, as has been seen on many many occasions it does not always happen. How does this provision change the current status and how does it make the court give a greater penalty?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021128"></A>
I think that particular question has been asked by a number of members on this side of the chamber and also by those on the crossbenches. The minister said in relation to the Penalties and Sentences Act--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021130"></A>
Currently, an offender convicted of a serious violent offence must serve 80 per cent of their sentence before being eligible to apply for parole release. The bill provides that, in the case of an offender convicted of an offence of violence committed against a young child or an offence that caused the death of a young child, the court must treat the age of the child as an aggravating factor when determining whether a serious violent offender declaration should be made.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1021132"></A>
Mrs Steinberg said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021134"></A>
The age of the child should not be the aggravating factor when determining if a serious violent offender declaration should be made.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021135"></A>
If the offence is against any child the declaration should be made and the offender made to serve out his full penalty not 80% here and 100% there--everyone serves their full penalty.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021136"></A>
Age of the victim should not be the deciding factor. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021137"></A>
As a way of explaining that, I raise this issue. If the child is under 12, the offender is required to serve the full term but if the child has turned 13 and the offences are more horrific the offender may still only have to serve 80 per cent. Page 9 of the legislation deals with 15AF, ‘Right of appearance in a guideline proceeding’. The legislation states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021139"></A>
The following persons may appear in a guideline proceeding--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1021140"></A>
(a)	the Attorney-General;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1021141"></A>
(b)	the director of public prosecutions;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1021142"></A>
(c)	the chief executive officer of Legal Aid Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021143"></A>
They are the principal people who may appear in a guideline proceeding. Heather’s comment, which I wholeheartedly agree with, states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021145"></A>
Why doesn’t the victim have a right to appear. The AG, DPP, Legal Aid and the offender can appear BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIM. Why can’t the victim appear or have a legal rep appear on their behalf. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021147"></A>
The one comment from Mrs Steinberg that strikes me here is that everyone forgets the victim. This is a comment coming from a practising solicitor who sees what happens day in, day out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021148"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Hoolihan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Nobody forgets the victim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021177"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Everyone forgets the victim. That is the reality of legal matters in Queensland in 2010. We see the same mistake again on page 11 of this legislation at 15AI, ‘Procedural requirements if court decides to give or review guideline judgment’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021181"></A>
There is a category of sex offender in Queensland officially known as a dangerous sex offender. I believe that they will be affected by clause 7 of this legislation, the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. Clause 7 amends 161B, ‘Declaration of conviction of serious violent offence.’ Dangerous sex offenders are the worst of the worst of sex offenders because they have committed heinous crimes against mainly children and women. A judge has to officially designate them as a dangerous sex offender under that particular legislation. It is much harder for these people to be released from prison but, ultimately, as we have seen, they are released. Right now I believe there are about 90 dangerous sex offenders living in secret in communities all over Queensland. I will just repeat that. They are living in secret in communities all over Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021184"></A>
In a recent parliamentary question on notice I tried to find out the number--not the names and the locations, but the number--of officially declared dangerous sex offenders living in the Burnett-Bundaberg region but the minister refused to even supply that basic information. The fact is that, after this bill passes through this place, dangerous sex offenders will still have their right to privacy, they will still have their civil liberties intact. It is these dangerous sex offenders who will be targeted by a private member’s bill which I believe will be Australia’s first sex offender laws, likened to the American law called Megan’s law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021186"></A>
I have just received from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel a first draft of the bill that I intend to introduce. I will be consulting with my independent colleagues, the people of the Burnett community, legal experts, child protection stakeholders and parents and grandparents. In the coming months I will introduce a private member’s bill which will name and locate dangerous sex offenders throughout Queensland so they will not be able to live in secret. I remind this place once again that it is only the most predatory, vile and heinous sex offender who would be forced to reveal their location. Should that bill be debated and should that bill be passed, ordinary Queensland mums and dads will then have the right to know if the government decides to release a dangerous sex offender or repeat child rapist into their street. Combined with this legislation, my private member’s bill will offer a chance for parents and grandparents to have what they do not have now, and that is their right to say to their children, ‘Stay away from that man. He is a bad man.’ When this bill is debated, as happened with this bill, the Penalties and Sentences Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010, both sides of this chamber will have an opportunity to vote and show how tough they are on sex offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021190"></A>
If I remained a member of the LNP, I would not have been allowed to introduce a Megan’s law. In the meetings I attended there was overwhelming opposition, mainly from the former Liberal members of the LNP, against a Megan’s law. They talk the talk, but they lack the courage to walk the walk. This was one of the reasons that I decided to become an independent member of this House: so I had the freedom to introduce a bill that, as the minister has said in his second reading speech, strengthens the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, those who commit sexual offences against children and offenders who are violent to young children or who cause the death of a young child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021191"></A>
In closing, I would like to quote one of my independent colleagues, the member for Nicklin, who said that magistrates and judges can do better. We all can. I commend this bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (12.45 pm): I rise to make a short contribution to the bill before the House. I will limit my comments to those parts of the bill that deal with the Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021195"></A>
If one goes to the second reading of the Attorney-General, one finds these three sentences. They state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021197"></A>
The Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council will seek to further promote consistency in sentencing; to stimulate balanced public debate on sentencing issues; and to incorporate informed community opinion into the sentencing process, thereby enhancing confidence in Queensland’s sentencing regime. The Sentencing Advisory Council will achieve these objectives through its functions of advising, informing, researching and educating on sentencing issues. In performing its functions, it is anticipated that the Queensland council will consult widely, including with the judiciary, the legal profession, government agencies and the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1021198"></A>
They are certainly words that are well worthwhile echoing. Without a doubt the bill, if it is passed today--and it certainly will be--will provide an avenue for the people of Queensland to have a more direct say on the sentencing regime under which they live. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021200"></A>
Of course, those words refer to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. Those exact same words could, of course, apply with equal force and effect to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2005. The words are interchangeable between the two because the bills, when they are compared--and I will do that in a few moments time--actually mirror each other if not in direct language, then certainly in intent, format, desire and proposed outcome. In fact, the body that the bills attempt to put into place are indeed identical. The Sentencing Advisory Council is the term used in both the 2005 bill and the 2010 bill. The 2005 bill was a creature of the LNP which was voted down by the government, some of whose members are still in the House today and I will refer to the comments they made both back then and, indeed, today as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021203"></A>
This government is so bereft of ideas and so unable to establish anything of difference and style or outcome that it could not even muster the energy to change the terminology to distinguish the Sentencing Advisory Council in 2005 from the Sentencing Advisory Council in 2010. So meagre was its intellectual capacity that it could not even gather the evidence to put a new name to the body that it intends to incorporate into our justice system. It is worthwhile going through both bills because they do deal with very similar matters, as I said earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021206"></A>
Of course, I mentioned the council now shares the common name. Let us look at the functions of the council under the bill in 2005 and under the bill in 2010. One of the criticisms--and I will come back to it later--was that there was a claim that the 2005 bill would direct the Court of Appeal as to what it could or could not do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025775"></A>
The 2005 bill stated, in relation to the functions of the council--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025778"></A>
‘The functions of the council are--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1025779"></A>
(a) 	to state in writing to the Court of Appeal its views in relation to the application by courts of the sentencing guidelines and principles in section 9; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025780"></A>
The 2010 bill uses different terminology, different phraseology, but it says this--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025782"></A>
The council has the function of stating in writing to the Court of Appeal its views on the giving, or review, of a guideline judgment within the meaning of part 2A. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1025783"></A>
That is the new provision in the bill.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025784"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Springborg:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 That’s the same thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025785"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the Deputy Leader of the Opposition’s interjection. They are exactly the same thing. In both bills the council has the capacity to the write to the Court of Appeal and present its views on sentencing and other matters. There is absolutely no distinction between the clauses in the 2005 bill and the 2010 bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025786"></A>
The 2005 bill empowered the council--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1025788"></A>

(b) 	to provide information to the community to enhance knowledge and understanding of matters relating to

(e) 	to obtain the community’s views on sentencing ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025799"></A>
The terminology and phraseology is different but the outcome is exactly the same. There is no distinction between the 2005 bill and the 2010 bill with regard to the functions to be performed. What it then does say in the 2005 bill is--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025801"></A>
‘In performing its functions, the council may obtain expert help from anyone whom the council considers to be appropriately qualified to help. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025802"></A>
The 2010 bill states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1025804"></A>
‘(2) 	To assist in performing its functions under subsection (1), the council may consult with the judiciary, government departments, any person or class of person and any other entity or class of entity. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025805"></A>
It is different terminology, different phraseology, but exactly the same outcome. The outcome and the intent of the two bills is mirrored. Then we go on to the composition of the membership of the council. The 2005 bill stated that it should comprise nine members but no more than 12. It then identified in the bill the type of persons or in fact the persons who would be appointed to the council. The 2010 bill says that it will comprise 12 members. It is certainly slightly more. But when one reads the proposed composition of the council and who may sit on the council, one finds that the terminology is different, the phraseology is different, but at the end of the day it is exactly the same body, it is exactly the same composition. This government, with a $40 billion budget this year alone, can do nothing more than cut and paste a 2005 bill, change the words, whack it into the parliament and then say, ‘We’re the heroes.’ </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Attorney should be charged with plagiarism. Five years has passed and the intellectual rigour of the government is such that it has said that the bill proposed by the LNP in 2005 was right. It has said, ‘We will rejig the language to make it look as though we have done something different.’ It has not done anything different. The bill remains exactly the same. But one group of people has lost out. The people of Queensland have for the past five years lost out when it comes to having a direct say in the sentencing regime under which they reside--a sentencing regime that we identified five years ago required, called for, begged for community consultation and input. This government turned its back on those people until suddenly it realised that it needed to be doing something to bolster its coffers and its polling in the lead-up to the next election campaign. That is what this is all about: make no mistake about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025808"></A>
So what is different? Let us have a look at some of the comments that were made when the debate ensued in 2005 and see what arguments the government used in 2005 to say that that bill, which is a mirror image of the 2010 bill, should not be put in place or does not achieve its goals. I refer to the library brief in relation to this bill, No. 19 of 2010. It deals with the issue of sentencing councils and an overview of models from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. At page 4 of that document there is a synopsis of some comments made by ministers and the government, some of whom are in the House today and some of whom have left the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025809"></A>
The Attorney-General at that time was the Hon. Linda Lavarch. She said the bill was ‘unworkable in the context of current sentencing practices’. If the bill in 2005 was unworkable on that basis and it mirrors the 2010 bill, is the government now saying that there has been some metamorphosis in relation to the sentencing practices in 2005 that allows this bill to go ahead today? The then Attorney-General made this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025812"></A>
It failed to recognise that is the role of the elected parliament to determine the appropriate sentencing framework for our courts to work within. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025813"></A>
That is what the then Attorney-General said five years ago. Here we have a bill put forward by this government that is purportedly doing exactly what the Attorney-General said back in 2005 it should not do. We now have the government saying that that is okay. The bills mirror each other. </Hansard-Body>

 My apologies. The honourable member for Murrumba made this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025820"></A>
This parliament actually determines the sentences that are to be imposed for different categories of offences. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025821"></A>
The 2005 bill mirrors the 2010 bill. What has happened to cause this change? In this House yesterday the member for Toowoomba North made this comment when referring to the 2005 bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025823"></A>
That model sought to remove the discretion of the court by allowing a sentencing advisory council to direct the Court of Appeal. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025824"></A>
What it means is that somehow the 2005 bill directed the Court of Appeal but the same powers in the 2010 bill do not direct the Court of Appeal. They are exactly the same powers, exactly the same rights and exactly the same entitlements, but they do not direct the Court of Appeal. A base political motive was the 2005 agenda in relation to this whole matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025825"></A>
The member for Toowoomba North is also a former Attorney-General. He knows very well that the 2005 bill would not have directed the Court of Appeal in any circumstances. His comment on the 2005 bill is absolutely incorrect, false and a complete and absolute fabrication. The member for Toowoomba North also makes this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025827"></A>
... the establishment of ‘a sentencing advisory council could seriously compromise the discretionary powers of the judiciary’ ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025828"></A>
The 2005 bill provided for a compromise situation to exist. The 2010 bill--that is, exactly the same bill--does not. This was done for base political motives. The member then goes on to make this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025830"></A>
The sentencing function is a judicial function and, as such, should be administered by judicial officers subject to the relevant law. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1025831"></A>
The 2005 bill is mirrored in the 2010 bill. There is no difference. The member knew at that time that the bill was correct. He knows that the 2010 bill is identical. It allows the people of Queensland to have a say in the sentencing regime. As a former Attorney-General, he well knows that. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025832"></A>
What we have quite clearly is this. We have before the House a bill that, as I have said many times--and I will keep saying--is exactly the same as the bill that was introduced in 2005. What is different is that the government is struggling to gain ascendency in the minds of the public of this state. It is grappling with how best to achieve that outcome. The outcome can only be achieved by stealing the ideas of the LNP and making them its own. But it did not take the time and the rigour to make it reflect its own intellectual capacity. What it has done is simply cut and paste a bill that existed in 2005 and was under the stamp of the LNP and then claim it as its own. It is shameful hypocrisy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1034549"></A>
The introduction of the Liquor and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 enables important liquor reforms for Queensland. One of the government’s Toward Q2 commitments is to support safe and caring communities. In 2008 the government undertook significant alcohol reform, including making harm minimisation the first object of the Liquor Act 1992. During 2009 and 2010 the government further amended the Liquor Act to ensure that the industry’s regulation is consistent with the public interest objective of minimising harm caused by alcohol abuse and misuse. This bill builds and expands on that approach. In developing this bill, the government has balanced the interests and expectations of industry and community whilst ensuring that the potential harm from liquor is minimised as much as possible. However, the reforms do not seek to remove the right of Queenslanders to enjoy themselves and partake of alcohol in a responsible manner, nor prevent liquor licensees from making a living and employing their fellow Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034554"></A>
On 4 August 2009 this parliament requested that the Law, Justice and Safety Committee conduct an inquiry into alcohol related violence in Queensland with a focus on community safety and preventative measures that might reduce levels of alcohol related violence. The final report of the parliamentary committee was tabled on 18 March 2010 with 68 recommendations to reduce the incidence and impacts, both social and economic, of alcohol related violence in Queensland. After comprehensive consultation with community and industry, the government’s response to the committee’s report was tabled in parliament on 30 August 2010. This bill implements part of the government’s response to the inquiry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034555"></A>
The central policy principle of the government’s response was a commitment to a place based management approach targeting key late-night entertainment areas where issues such as crowding, queuing, traffic and inadequate amenities impact upon safety. These entertainment precincts--to be known as drink safe precincts--will be managed similar to a major sporting event, with coordinated use of police and other state and local government resources. Drink safe precincts will be piloted in Fortitude Valley, Surfers Paradise and Townsville for two years from December 2010, with the government committing funding of $4.267 million for the first year. Existing trading hours and lockout times will remain to provide certainty to licensees and patrons and give the new approach a chance to work. If the pilots are successful, there is potential to implement them in other areas throughout Queensland as required. The bill allows for these drink safe precincts to be prescribed in a regulation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034558"></A>
The bill also provides for new powers to ban people from specified areas. It establishes a civil banning order regime under the Liquor Act which enables the court to issue a banning order upon adults who engage in prescribed behaviour within a drink safe precinct and where the order is necessary to ensure the safety, welfare and good order of licensed premises, and the surrounding public areas, within a drink safe precinct. They may be up to 12 months in duration. A civil ban applied to persons not charged with an offence may be perceived as harsh, but the government is determined to protect the public from individuals who perpetrate alcohol related violence in our community. It is intended that during the drink safe precinct pilots the civil banning regime will be monitored to ensure that it achieves its desired effect whilst minimising the impact on the rights and liberties of persons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034561"></A>
The bill also amends the Penalties and Sentences Act to create a banning order as a sentencing option in its own right. This option is not limited to offending within a drink safe precinct. It may be imposed if the offender is convicted of an offence that involved violence to a person or property which occurred in or around licensed premises and the court is satisfied that, unless the order is made, the offender poses an unacceptable risk to the safety, welfare and good order of licensed premises. The bill also amends the Bail Act 1980 to specify a ‘special condition’ to a grant of bail can include a banning order. It places a mandatory requirement on the bail granting authority to consider including a banning condition in certain circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034565"></A>
The bill includes amendments to the Liquor Act and the Gaming Machine Act to expand the responsibility of the Queensland Gaming Commission so that it becomes the Queensland Liquor and Gaming Commission and makes key liquor licensing decisions of significant community impact, including decisions on new hotel licences, nightclubs and extended trading hours. The expanded role of the commission will build on the significant expertise and success that has ensured an appropriate balance in the provision of gambling services. This is a streamlining process that was commenced with the government’s April 2000 policy direction for gambling in Queensland which called for synergies in liquor and gaming licensing processes to avoid duplication. The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burden for industry and the community to promote productivity, foster innovation and increase competitiveness.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034569"></A>
The bill also amends the Liquor Act to allow standard licence conditions to be prescribed in a regulation. This will allow for a more efficient method of regulating licensees, with common conditions--for example, safety initiatives--being applied in a standard manner rather than individually for each licence. The bill provides for a retitling of the ‘objectives’ of the Liquor Act to the ‘main purposes’ of the Liquor Act. It provides for a new main purpose of the act which is to regulate the liquor industry, and areas surrounding licensed premises, in a way compatible with three outcomes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039084"></A>
The first of these outcomes is the minimisation of harm, and the potential harm, from alcohol abuse, misuse and associated violence. The second is the minimisation of adverse impacts on the health or safety of members of the public. The third is one that minimises adverse impacts on the amenity of the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039086"></A>
Placing these matters as the main purposes of the Liquor Act is intended to strengthen the commission’s and chief executive’s ability to have regard to these primary policy objectives when making decisions. To ensure commission decisions take into account the concerns of the whole community, the bill provides an amendment to the Liquor Act that allows the responsible minister to make a direct objection to an application of significant community impact. The commission must have regard to any ministerial objection when it considers the application.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039087"></A>
The bill also provides the commission with the power to delegate its decision-making authority. It is intended this will allow the commission to delegate decisions of minimal impact or risk to allow the commission to focus on higher risk applications and to ensure the timeliness of decision making. For example, the commission may wish to delegate temporary, one-off applications to extend the licensed area, increase trading hours or vary the conditions of licence to allow amplified music for a special event or function, for example, on Australia Day or New Year’s Eve. The commission will specify which minor decisions will be delegated to the chief executive in an instrument of delegation made by the commission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039088"></A>
The bill extends the current moratorium on extended trading hours, currently due to expire at midnight on 15 December 2010, until 31 December 2013. This extension allows time for evidence from the evaluation of the drink safe precinct pilots to inform government policy regarding harm minimisation strategies. The bill also amends the Liquor Act to provide new trading hours for bottle shops and other takeaway liquor outlets. New applications relating to bottle shops and takeaway liquor outlets will be restricted to ordinary trading hours between 10 am and 10 pm, with the ability to apply for extended trading hours between 9 am and 10 am, and 10 pm and midnight, if there is demonstrated community need. It is intended that the threshold for the commission in deciding what constitutes demonstrated community need will be a balance of factors, including demand that may result from the premises being located in a tourist or dining area, but also community amenity and safety and the social impact of the extended trading hours on the local area. Also, the bill, consistent with the government response to the parliamentary inquiry, prescribes the definition of ‘amenity’ in the Liquor Act to provide further clarity in decision making by the commission or chief executive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039090"></A>
The bill also amends the Adult Proof of Age Card Act 2008 to allow a person who is at least 17 years and 11 months to apply for an adult proof of age card. The amendments provide that if an applicant is under 18 years the chief executive must not issue the adult proof of age card until the applicant is at least 18 years of age. The Queensland government is introducing a more reliable, secure and durable adult proof of age card to replace the existing Card 18+. In contrast to a Card 18+, an adult proof of age card will no longer be issued over the counter but will be mailed from a secure central location. These amendments provide a means by which a person can obtain an adult proof of age card on or immediately following their 18th birthday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039091"></A>
The amendments in the bill demonstrate this government’s ongoing and evident commitment to reducing harm, and the potential for harm, from alcohol in the community. It also provides another example of our commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on business and the community. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (2.43 pm): I rise to speak in support of this reforming legislation and I commend the Attorney-General for introducing this bill to the House. Public confidence in the criminal justice system is integral to the operation of this bill. That is what it is all about. It has been disappointing to listen to this debate in the chamber with member after member of the opposition seeking to decline public confidence through ridicule of our judges and magistrates for sentences that they have imposed. Prior to today’s debate, the recent debate on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 was similarly a disgrace. We heard members opposite constantly decrying sentences as a slap on the wrist or of weak judges and magistrates imposing pathetic sentences. Yet did the members opposite ever name the weak judges or tell us what the weak penalties were? No. They were deafening in their silence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039100"></A>
The fact is that everyone in this House supports tough penalties for violent offenders and sex offenders and for crimes against children. Indeed, participation in the Australian democracy requires acceptance of a criminal justice system that can imprison people for crimes against society and on both sides of this House there is no tolerance for criminal activity. On many occasions I have spoken in this place of my dismay at the preparedness of members opposite to engage in low-rent law and order fearmongering. This fearmongering, which effectively says to the community, ‘You are at great risk of being a victim--of being hurt, killed or raped--and the offender will get off lightly,’ is totally irresponsible. It is disgraceful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039101"></A>
Laws must be enforced and sentencing must be adequate. Indeed, sentencing must be very tough for serious crimes. But our responsibility as community leaders is not to foster fear of crime in the community. The tactic of fearmongering is a tool of both the dictator and the directionless and it is our responsibility as members of parliament to lead. But the great tragedy of fearmongering is often that those in our community with a lower risk of being a victim of crime develop the greatest fear of being a victim, and that is at the core of the irresponsibility of the rhetoric of those opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039102"></A>
Most of what we have heard from opposition members is in stark contrast to the reality of what is going on in Queensland. Crime rates are down, police clearance rates are up and more offenders are spending time in jail than ever before. But we do not hear that from members opposite, and that is because the facts belie their cheap political rhetoric. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039103"></A>
Let me put some of the facts in relation to crime, policing and sentencing on the record. Firstly, in relation to police resourcing, this government has continued to deliver on its commitment to increase police numbers and ensure that in Queensland the ratio of police to population remains above the national average. The facts show that. Before the current government came to power in 1998, the police-to-population ratio was one officer for every 501 Queenslanders. Since this government came to office, the police-to-population ratio has improved significantly and remains better than the national average. The ratio is currently around one officer for every 427 people in Queensland, with a national average of one officer for every 440 people. Additionally, police numbers have risen by almost 4,000--from 6,833 in 1998 to 10,400 officers in Queensland today--and in this year’s budget the Treasurer advised of provision for a further 203 police officers in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

When we look at capital expenditure, the facts show that spending by the Bligh government on policing infrastructure and capital works leads the nation. According to the 2009 <Hansard-Italic>
Report on government services</Hansard-Italic>
, in 2008-09 Queensland spent more than 40 per cent of all of the capital expenditure spent on policing across Australia and Queensland’s expenditure was $219.6 million--more than three times the national average of $67.3 million. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1039106"></A>
But what about crime rates and the perception of crime? Members opposite often raise the fear of rising crime rates, and I am concerned about a public perception that there is increasing violence and criminal activity in the community. These perceptions build on the rhetoric of the LNP and are not supported by statistics. In July 2010 the report of the Australian Institute of Criminology titled <Hansard-Italic>
(Mis)perceptions of crime in Australia</Hansard-Italic>
 revealed that more than 60 per cent of respondents held an incorrect perception that crime rates were increasing when, in fact, they are going down and that more than a third of respondents believed that violence was involved in more than 70 per cent of crimes when the reality is that violence is involved in less than 10 per cent of all crimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039146"></A>
When we look at crime rate statistics, we see that since this current government was first elected crime rates have fallen. The overall rate of crime has dropped by 21.5 per cent and, additionally, property offences are down 42.5 per cent and offences against the person are down 18.7 per cent. Important also are clearance rates, where the facts show that more crimes are now being solved. The clearance rate--that is, the rate of reported crimes that are solved for offences against the person--has increased from 62 per cent in 1997-98 to 72 per cent in 2007-08. For property offences the rate increased from 24 per cent in 1997-98 to 31 per cent in 2007-08. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039147"></A>
We also know that imprisonment rates in Queensland are high. I get no joy from imprisonment rates in Queensland being high, but it belies the rhetoric of the opposition. As the Attorney-General has pointed out, there are one million more people in Victoria than in Queensland and yet Queensland has more people in jail. Queensland courts are locking up criminals at a rate above the national and international average with only two jurisdictions, New South Wales and the Northern Territory, having a higher rate of imprisonment for serious criminal offending. In light of all of these facts, this government recognises that there remains a need for ensuring that sentencing outcomes continue to meet community expectations. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1039148"></A>
Before moving on to some of the specific amendments contained in this bill, I will comment on what we have heard from members opposite about this bill and their 2005 bill. I was here for the contribution by the ‘Dennis Denuto’ of Caloundra where he talked about how this bill was exactly the same. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He was a great Australian. The member tried to promulgate the argument that this bill is exactly the same as the 2005 bill that the opposition introduced. There was nothing in there about guideline judgements. What was in there was a sentencing council having the power to direct a court. It was fundamentally different. That was simply a stunt. The members opposite know that they regularly put up private members’ bills to run political rhetoric on a law and order, low rent auction. They did not come in here with a well-researched, factually based, considered bill. In fact, in the 6 years that I have been in this place I have seen plenty of private members’ bills. Has a member of the LNP ever sought me out to consult with me as a member of parliament about what their bill means? Has one of them ever come to me and said, ‘Hey, we would like to brief you on this bill’? No, not once--not interested. Does government brief opposition members on its bills? All the time. Does government go out to stakeholders in development of its legislation? All the time. It belies reality for the members opposite to come in here and say that this bill is a stunt when the record clearly shows that is their record, that is their activity. What they do is come in here with political rhetoric; what we do is come in with measured, balanced legislation to put through the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039152"></A>
In this bill we see a proposed Sentencing Advisory Council. What this council is about is enhancing community dialogue about sentencing and injecting community opinion into sentencing principles. The council of 12 members will have a broad based membership with representation spread across many community groups and it will be enabled to advise on sentencing matters. It will also advise the Court of Appeal on its views on giving or reviewing guideline judgements. The council will also have an educative role in the community through enhancing knowledge and understanding of sentencing as well as conducting research and publishing its findings on topics relating to sentencing. One of the important roles of the council will be to gather the community’s views on sentencing and particular matters relating to sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039153"></A>
The bill also makes amendments to section 9 of the Penalties and Sentences Act to add an additional provision that the court must consider when sentencing an offender for offences of a sexual nature against a child under 16 years of age. In these cases the offender must serve an actual term of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances. That is not a soft-on-crime position. The description of this by members opposite as a get-out-of-jail-free card and their hue and cry about the provision again belies the facts. Before a court chooses not to jail an offender it must be satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances. Exceptional has its ordinary meaning, not the somewhat watered down meaning that the opposition try to imply. The act provides that when determining whether extraordinary circumstances exist, the court can look at the closeness in age between the offender and the child. Such closeness does not automatically constitute exceptional circumstances; it is just a factor that the court may look at. This is not new. It is not a new principle of law. The government is enshrining this sentencing principle in legislation, ensuring that it remains law in Queensland. In a similar vein, repeat offenders will be subject to a new provision which ensures that the court, when determining the appropriate penalty for a person with a previous conviction, must treat each conviction as an aggravating factor. The court must of course consider previous convictions in relation to relevance to the current offence and time factors. Once again, it is not a soft-on-crime amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039154"></A>
The Queensland government is particularly committed to the protection of the vulnerable in our society, especially children. The last amendment contained in this bill relates to perpetrators who commit acts of violence against young children. Where an offence involves violence against a child under 12 years of age or causes the death of a child under 12, the sentencing court must treat the age of the child as an aggravating factor when considering whether to impose a serious violent offender order. Again, that is not a soft-on-crime provision. These are innovative provisions which strengthen the power of the courts to provide appropriate sentences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039155"></A>
The Labor government is tough on crime and the causes of crime and through this bill empowers the courts to determine tough and appropriate sentences. The government does this through reliance on proper policy responses informed by research and statistics. This is in stark contrast to the LNP opposition whose members simply pluck up an idea around which to build fear and hide their complete lack of policy direction behind the baseless rhetoric of the uninformed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039156"></A>
Members of the community expect safety and protection and a robust criminal justice system, but they also expect rationality and leadership from their lawmakers. Our job is to build confidence in the justice system and ensure that it meets the needs of society and the reasonable expectations of the community. That is what this bill is about and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(2.56 pm), in reply: I am pleased to be able to speak in response to a number of matters raised in this important debate on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. At the outset I thank all honourable members for their contribution, particularly those members of the government who spoke on the bill. A number of those speeches stood out: the member for Woodridge and her very thoughtful analysis of what actually happens in Queensland courts each and every day and the role that a whole range of individuals and groups play in that; and the address by the member for Chatsworth who, along with the member for Yeerongpilly, comprehensively demolished the falsehoods perpetrated by the Liberal National Party opposition in relation to crime and law and order in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The highlight of the debate for me overall was that it illustrated that the opposition is a long-term, lazy, fundamentally ignorant opposition in this state. We know they are lazy. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I served in Tuvalu very proudly for three years as a volunteer under Australian Volunteers Abroad. When I came into this parliament I thought that there would be some things that would be above politics. I thought that there would be some things outside of the nature of political debate. When the pressure is put on the member for Southern Downs on various issues by me as the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations he resorts to this denigration not just of me as a volunteer--I do not care about his denigration of me personally--but of Australians who serve their country as a volunteer and he denigrates those people, the overwhelming majority of the world, who live in poverty and disadvantage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043979"></A>
I will not be criticised by the member for Southern Downs about my service as an international volunteer. I do not care about myself but he denigrates all Australians who have served overseas. I remind the member for Southern Downs to read some of the first speeches by the members of the Liberal National Party who were elected to this place in 2009. I ask him to read some of those speeches where they talk about their service as volunteers overseas. I look forward to him denigrating the member for Cleveland and others for being volunteers who have worked overseas. He belittles volunteers. He belittles international volunteering. But most of all he belittles himself. I will say more about the member for Southern Downs as we go through this debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043984"></A>
Both the member for Chatsworth and the member for Yeerongpilly demolished the criticisms of the LNP about law and order and crime in this state. One statistic that never crosses the lips of members of the Liberal National Party is that crime is down 20 per cent under Labor. That is all I ask them to acknowledge--that crime in Queensland has dropped 20 per cent since Labor was elected to power in 1998. It is one simple fact. If they are unable to acknowledge that, everything they say must be seen through the prism of falsehood and political populism. That is all. That is the only way you can demonstrate it. We do need to lift debate in this state about law and order, but it will never be lifted if the Liberal National Party fails to acknowledge facts about the safety of the Queensland community delivered by Labor governments successively over 12 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043987"></A>
Let us turn to some of the other issues. I want to talk about some of the fundamental principles in this bill and then I will talk about some of those matters that were raised by the opposition in the debate. Firstly, the bill amends the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 to create the state’s first Sentencing Advisory Council and to confer power upon the Queensland Court of Appeal to deliver and review guideline judgements. The bill also reflects the Bligh government’s tough-on-crime approach in its three discrete amendments relating to child sexual offenders, repeat offenders and those who commit violence upon or who cause the death of a young child. These are serious matters and are deserving of serious debate in this parliament but debate based on facts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043988"></A>
These amendments represent significant initiatives to strengthen our criminal justice system--a system that plays an important role in creating a safe community for all Queenslanders. Central to our criminal justice system must be a strong and fair sentencing regime. The amendments are best understood in two parts but parts that form a continuum of reforms aimed at improving the clarity and transparency of our sentencing processes and providing a robust foundation upon which our courts can undertake the complex task of sentencing criminal offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043989"></A>
The first part of the amendments create a Sentencing Advisory Council for Queensland that will help bridge any gap between community expectations, the courts and the government on the issue of sentencing. Through its education role, the Sentencing Advisory Council will foster greater public understanding of the sentencing processes and competing issues, thereby enhancing public support for sentencing decisions and reforms. Through its community engagement role, the Sentencing Advisory Council will provide an opportunity for the community to have a voice in the development of sentencing policy. Through its research, advice and consultation, the Sentencing Advisory Council will promote sentencing reforms that are well grounded and reflect best practice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043990"></A>
The structure of the Sentencing Advisory Council will ensure a broad range of membership, including community representation. It will recognise the impact of sentencing options on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Queensland and vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system. The bill ensures flexibility in the selection of members and provides considerable detail as to the depth of experience or expertise members will possess. This will ensure a fair and representative balance of members. The function of the Sentencing Advisory Council in providing its views to the Court of Appeal on the issue of guideline judgements offers an important new mechanism by which properly gauged and informed public opinion can be injected into the sentencing system. The conferral of jurisdiction on the Queensland Court of Appeal to give or review guideline judgements provides a means by which the Court of Appeal can give guidance to sentencing courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043991"></A>
The second part of the reforms aims to strengthen the penalties imposed upon child sexual offenders, repeat offenders and offenders who commit violence upon a young child or who cause the death of a young child. Two judicial sentencing principles currently applied by the Queensland courts will be inserted into the Penalties and Sentences Act to make crystal clear to the courts and the community that these sentencing principles are to be followed. Enshrining these principles in statute gives permanency to the principles and clearly signals parliament’s intention with regard to offenders who sexually abuse children and offenders who continue to disregard the law. It will give the community greater certainty and confidence as to the principles that the courts must apply when passing sentence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043992"></A>
The first principle, which relates to child sexual offenders, complements the existing legislative measures aimed at protecting our must vulnerable members of the community. The bill provides that offenders convicted of an offence of a sexual nature in relation to a child under 16 years must serve an actual period of imprisonment, unless there are exceptional circumstances. I want to talk to that issue of exceptional circumstances and about the need to maintain discretion in Queensland courts. There is a line that is now forming between the position consistently held by Labor governments and that of the opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043993"></A>
Mandatory sentencing, which removes all aspects of discretion from a court, as the opposition well knows, does not work in reducing crime or delivering just outcomes for Queenslanders. What in fact happens--and the opposition knows it well--is that the criminal justice system is distorted by mandatory sentencing. Firstly, it leads to unjust results. Why? Because all offenders are treated the same. Whether it be a first-time juvenile offender or someone who is a serious criminal with a history of offending, all are treated the same under mandatory sentencing principles. It takes proportionality out of it, and I do not think it represents community values or Queensland values to treat them all the same when there are clearly different types of criminal offending that the court must admit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043994"></A>
Judicial discretion is a fundamental part of our criminal justice system and is retained in this amendment through the inclusion of the ‘exceptional circumstances’ proviso. The most disturbing part of this debate--and there was much to be disturbed by from the comments of members of the Liberal National Party--was their untrammelled desire to remove the exceptional circumstances provision from the amendment. As my second reading speech clearly demonstrates, there are cases where the court must take into account--and should quite properly take into account--matters relating to exceptional circumstances. It is worth repeating the comments that I made during my second reading address to the parliament. I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043998"></A>
While it is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage circumstances in which a violent sexual offender might satisfy such a provision and, in doing so, not be sentenced to an actual term of imprisonment, there may be some offences that will be caught by this provision which involve circumstances that warrant further careful consideration. For example, where a 17-year-old and 15-year-old were in a consensual relationship, it might seem unjust that one of them be imprisoned for conduct in the course of the relationship that raised no other inference of criminality but for the fact of their respective ages. These are not easy cases, and nor are they cases in which the appropriate sentence in each case will be non-custodial. As such, the law must be capable of providing a just and appropriate sentence based upon all the facts in a case, most notably where those facts are unusual and differ from more straightforward examples. As a general principle, the strength of our legal system must be measured not only by its capacity to imprison those who transgress the law but also by whether it is sufficiently robust and fair so as to guard against injustice that might be visited upon the few. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043999"></A>
It is perhaps in the nature of the Liberal National Party that they never seek to defend the few--those who are vulnerable, those without a voice, those who are marginalised. They are swept away in the mad desire by the Liberal National Party to impose mandatory sentencing in Queensland. All I would say to all honourable members opposite, as I say to members on this side of the chamber, is that we have sons and daughters. We have young people who may go into the criminal justice system. How could it possibly be just for one person to be imprisoned--sent to a prison in Queensland to serve actual jail time--in circumstances where the only fundamental factor about their criminal transgression may be their age when all other aspects of their relationship may be consensual? That may not excuse them from a breach of the criminal law. It may not excuse them from punishment. But it is cruel and profoundly wrong for the Liberal National Party to continue to say that young people must go to jail for entering into consensual relationships with each other as young people. It is profoundly wrong and cruel for that to continue to be perpetrated by the Liberal National Party in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044003"></A>
It is easy to come into this place and to sloganeer and seek to run public policy on the basis of slogans without substance. We see that every day in this parliament by the Liberal National Party seeking to obtain political advantage, but we must take this debate to a higher place. Labor will always stand for discretion in the criminal justice system and discretion in our courts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048632"></A>
The second principle I mentioned reinforces the government’s and the community’s denunciation of recidivists who continue to disobey the law. The bill ensures that, when sentencing a repeat offender, the court must treat previous relevant convictions as an aggravating factor in determining the appropriate sentence. The result of this is that the court will increase the penalty to be given to the offender within the established common law sentencing range for that conduct. So we leave it to the courts. It is another factor that must be taken into account when determining a sentence. As a safeguard, the bill expressly provides that the penalty imposed must not be disproportionate to the gravity of the current offence--another safeguard that we respect within the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048633"></A>
Lastly, the bill makes an important amendment to the serious violent offence provisions of the Penalties and Sentences Act. The effect of a serious violent offence declaration is that the offender must serve 80 per cent of their sentence before being eligible to apply for parole release. The amendment targets the small cohort of prisoners who commit the most serious offences--namely, those who commit violence upon a young child or who cause the death of a young child. The amendment recognises the special vulnerability of very young children and the need to legislatively protect them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048634"></A>
The bill provides that, in the case of an offender convicted of an offence of violence committed against a young child or an offence that caused the death of a young child, where the court has the discretion to declare the offender to be convicted of a serious violent offence, the court must treat the age of the child as an aggravating factor in making that determination. We leave it to the courts to determine those categories of individuals who should be declared serious violent offenders--when all of the facts in the case are considered and determined by the court. We leave it to the courts to make that decision. If you remove discretion, if you say that courts must sentence on a mandatory basis--which the opposition suggests--then we may as well bring offenders in Queensland to the bar of this parliament and judge them here ourselves and impose the penalty. </Hansard-Body>

 We might as well move away from a judicial based justice system. I do not understand the concern when the courts in Queensland have served our state in an overwhelmingly positive way for 150 years. I do not think we should be seeking to attack and denigrate them, as the Liberal National Party does. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048637"></A>
I make the point again: under successive Labor governments since 1998, the rate of crime in Queensland has dropped 20 per cent. People are safer in their homes under Labor. They are safer than they have ever been. We have these falsehoods perpetrated by the Liberal National Party. The rate of crime is down 20 per cent. All I ask for is a genuine and good faith acknowledgement of that by those members opposite. When Liberal National Party members talk about crime the way they do, all it does is inflame community concern and anxiety.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It makes people frightened unnecessarily, I take the interjection by the member for Chatsworth. It unnecessarily concerns people in the community. We want to be tough on crime, and we have demonstrated that over 12 years and we will demonstrate it again by introducing standard non-parole periods in Queensland courts. But the difference between mandatory sentencing and standard non-parole periods is this: we will admit discretion in the process. We will say that a court can determine that the sentence can be increased or decreased, but if there is a deviation the court must explain that in accordance with set criteria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048641"></A>
There may be a case where a non-custodial sentence may be imposed, but the court will need to explain that in its judgement. Why? Because every case is different. We cannot move away from a system of individualised justice in Queensland. I say to the member for Southern Downs, as I say to all families, one day it might be your son, your daughter or a relative of yours who goes before a Queensland court and, if you go down the path of mandatory sentencing, all you will do is send more people to jail on an unjust basis and you will not make Queensland safer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048643"></A>
I want to talk to a number of those matters raised by the opposition in this debate. The member for Southern Downs asserted that the presentation of this bill before the House was a recognition that the current sentencing regime had failed. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a government that listens and responds to the community. We have always done that and we will continue to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048644"></A>
Most notably, the member for Southern Downs expressed great dissatisfaction with the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. It is worth noting that, despite all of the honourable member’s complaints and crocodile tears, he cannot escape the fact that under the Liberal and National governments in this state, recidivist sex offenders were released free and clear into the community, without any measure of control. Members of his political organisation were unwilling or unable to keep them in custody. They were unable to bring the appropriate legislation into this place, and that is what Labor did. The most dangerous people in the Queensland community either continue in custody or are released into the community under very strict supervision. For some of those offenders, that means that those provisions prohibit where they can live, who they can associate with, where they can go at what times during the day or night, whether they can consume alcohol--all of those prohibitions are on their lives. Some have up to 40 or 50 different prohibitions. Why? Because we put community safety first. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048645"></A>
The member for Southern Downs then went on an extraordinary attack against the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the hardworking prosecutors in this state. He claimed that prosecutors were ‘forced into plea bargains’, that they were forced to ‘settle quick and settle easy’. This is a disgraceful slur on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is a cowardly attack. The member for Southern Downs is happy to attack them here but he will not attack them in the community, he will not attack them outside of this chamber where he is protected by parliamentary privilege. It is a craven attack on the Director of Public Prosecutions and his hardworking staff to suggest that they make decisions on any basis other than the publicly available and published guidelines.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right; I take the interjection from the member for Toowoomba North. What does that do for the morale of Queensland prosecutors who work at the hard edge of the criminal justice system every day? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048650"></A>
The legal community should be on notice once again that it is clear that Liberal National Party members have no respect for the independence of the DPP and would be only too willing to interfere and direct the DPP about what they should prosecute and what they should not. Again, we leave the prosecutorial direction in Queensland to the independent DPP, and I for one as the Attorney-General will never seek to interfere in that. More than that, the member for Southern Downs then went on to complain that the police had too much discretion in charging individuals. So the police are also on notice by the Liberal National Party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048651"></A>
The member for Southern Downs also indulged himself in a complaint about the use of suspended sentences and that they were somehow evidence of improper discretion. What the honourable member ignores, and what LNP members have always ignored--either because they do not understand them or they are too scared to repeat them--is that the statistics tell a very different story. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released at the start of this year demonstrate that, for serious offences, Queensland courts are using fully suspended sentences at the second lowest rate in the nation. In the Magistrates Court, Queensland has the lowest rate of suspended sentences in the nation.</Hansard-Body>

The LNP member for Buderim was also interested in the ABS figures but could not quite bring himself to develop a clear understanding of the document. Despite the issues primarily in question in this bill concerning serious sexual and violent offending, the member for Buderim seemed intent on discussing Magistrates Courts figures. Why? Because it fitted their argument to continue to cause concern and distress in the Queensland community about the rate of crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048653"></A>
The member for Buderim seemed intent on discussing Magistrates Courts figures, where, yes, the Queensland magistrates do not sentence a high proportion of offenders to imprisonment. Why is that? Is it because they have too much discretion? Is it because they love to let criminals walk free in Queensland? No, it is because the vast majority of offences sentenced in the Magistrates Courts are minor offences--things like public nuisance and traffic offences. I would say that the majority of Queenslanders would not expect people who commit public nuisance offences or traffic offences to be going to jail. Should those people go to prison, the question might be asked? According to the member for Buderim, everyone should go to prison because that is all he knows and that is all he wishes to push to cause concern in the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048654"></A>
The day before the member for Buderim spoke we had a debate in this House about moving those offences out of the Magistrates Court. We talked about an overwhelming number of cases, particularly public nuisance offences, being moved out of the Magistrates Court so they could be ticketable offences--so we could free up courts to deal with the most serious offending and have individuals ticketed by police. That was a debate we had the day before the member for Buderim spoke on the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053360"></A>
Finally on this issue, it seemed to me that the member for Buderim sought to deliberately misread chapter 2 of the ABS report containing his figures, which relates to the higher courts. In his address to the parliament he kept mentioning the ‘High Court’. It was not, in fact, the High Court of Australia; it referred to ‘higher courts’. The member seemed to flagrantly ignore the distinction drawn by the ABS between a custodial order, which includes custody in the community and suspended sentences, and custody in a correctional institution, which means exactly what it is: time in prison. To make it clear for the honourable member: when I talk about imprisonment rates in the higher courts, I have used the time in prison figure as the most appropriate and accurate indicator. In order to measure how regularly courts send people to prison it seems sensible to look at a direct measure of how regularly courts send people to jail. </Hansard-Body>

As would be predicted, the member for Southern Downs, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was at his most shrill when complaining that the Sentencing Advisory Council--as he sought to do--was his own idea. On 11 May 2005 the opposition introduced a private member’s bill to create a Sentencing Advisory Council modelled on the approach in Victoria but with a number of key differences. Quite properly, the private member’s bill was defeated in the House on 29 September 2005. The Sentencing Advisory Council proposed in this bill differs from the opposition’s model in a number of critical and important respects. Unlike the opposition’s model, the bill confers jurisdiction on the Queensland Court of Appeal to give or review guideline judgements and inserts a new part 2A into the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. One of the statutory functions of the Sentencing Advisory Council will be to provide advice to the Court of Appeal on guideline judgements. This offers an important new mechanism by which properly gauged and informed public opinion can be injected into the sentencing system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053371"></A>
Unlike the opposition’s model, this bill provides a legitimate interface between the council and the Court of Appeal. The council would not be able to give unsolicited advice to the Court of Appeal directly, and that is precisely what the opposition sought to do in its bill in 2005. What did proposed new section 198 of its 2005 bill say? It states--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1053377"></A>
This is of the Penalties and Sentences Act. We had the opposition setting up a body appointed by the executive to state its views in writing anywhere, any time, on any basis to the Court of Appeal. We would have had a body created by the executive providing its views and directing the Court of Appeal on what it says the applicability of sentencing principles should be. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053380"></A>
I said earlier in this debate that this is a lazy, fundamentally ignorant, long-term opposition and its members demonstrate it again by their complete failure to understand the doctrine of the separation of powers, that the executive and the legislature are separate from an independent judiciary. They seem to play with these ideas. As one of the opposition members said in the debate two weeks ago, ‘Don’t lecture to us’--meaning the opposition--‘about the doctrine of the separation of powers.’ Why would we want to do that? It is only fundamental to the way in which Queensland democracy works. They seemed to conflate these ideas in their shrill attack during the law and order debate. It is completely improper for a body of the executive to give unsolicited advice to a court--that is, the executive seeking to monster, seeking to direct, seeking to put pressure on the judiciary. We say that the judiciary needs to be separate and independent to make its decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053381"></A>
Under the model put forward by the government that is before the House today, the council can only provide advice where the Court of Appeal is considering whether to give or review a guideline judgement. The advice is to be given upon notification by the court of its intention in that regard. The approach maintains the integrity and independence of the court. We put that first. We have this shrill argument put forward, including by a qualified lawyer, the member for Caloundra, that there was no difference between these bills. I can excuse the member for Southern Downs for his ignorance about the matter, but it was stunning to hear the member for Caloundra saying that the bills were ‘exactly the same’. They are far from being exactly the same. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053383"></A>
There was an attack on the last resort principle, as we see by the LNP all the time. Its members want to remove that. Of course, for the LNP, justice equals jail. It is their only response. If they looked at the statistics, if they had seen crime drop 20 per cent, they would know there is an interaction between a whole range of sentencing principles and outcomes including, much to the horror of the LNP, non-custodial orders made by courts and non-custodial measures so that people can go back into the community. Why? So they can become productive and functioning members of society where they do not re-offend and do not go back into the justice system--that is what we want to see--resulting in a reduction in crime by 20 per cent under Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053384"></A>
There were a number of other stunning contributions in the debate by members opposite. The member for Kawana, joining in the rancid tradition of what is a lazy, ignorant, long-term opposition, said that it was time to ‘listen to the LNP on law and order’. Let us take that invitation and think about the depth of the LNP law and order plan. I will take the advice of the member for Gaven and say it like it is, as he said. The LNP wants to publicly name persons who may be part of the witness protection program. The LNP wants to force the DPP to report to parliament if they do not like his independent decisions. This is what they have done in the last 18 months. The LNP wants to discipline wayward judges for political reasons. That is what they said in the debate two weeks ago. The LNP wants to treat first-time offenders in the same way as career criminals. For the LNP, the member for Gaven and all those members opposite, that is how it is. It would be a sad day, indeed, if the LNP ever got their hands on a justice system because it would not be a justice system; it would be an injustice system. With those concluding remarks, I commend this bill to the parliament. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 Explanatory notes to Mr Springborg’s amendments to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill [<HypertextLink>

<A ID="pgfId-1053394"></A>
As I indicated in my contribution to the second reading speech, whilst being generally supportive of the principle of the bill, the LNP has some very serious reservations with regard to the way that the bill will be used and the way that it will be interpreted. Chief amongst those is the fact that the government promises to get really tough and really consistent when it comes to the application of the criminal law in Queensland with regard to violent sexual offences or sexual offences against children. However, if we read the provisions of the legislation, nothing could be further from the truth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062992"></A>
The first amendment that I am moving here today deals very much with the issue of the sentencing of that offender and making sure that the person is subjected to a period of incarceration which will ensure that they undertake a process of compulsory rehabilitation. We know that under this government there is not a formal, proper, consistent process of people undertaking sex offenders rehabilitation courses in Queensland. It is just not happening. Indeed, some 80 to 90 per cent of sexual offenders in our prison system go through the prison system--and that is a statistic that we cannot argue about--without, firstly, being offered a sexual offenders rehabilitation course or, secondly, successfully completing that particular course. That is of real concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062999"></A>
If the government is serious about breaking the cycle of sex offending by these people who often have predatory behaviour and if the government is serious about ensuring a rehabilitative environment then the least it can do is support this amendment, which is about ensuring that the period of incarceration considered by the sentencing court is commensurate with the amount of time it would take a person to undertake a sex offenders rehabilitation course. I think the community at large is absolutely dumbfounded by the notion that we have people graduating from the jail system who have been charged, convicted and then ordered to complete a sex offenders rehabilitation course who are not completing that sex offender rehabilitation course in our jails. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058233"></A>
This ties in with the other amendment that I intend to move in relation to prescribing the circumstances under which a person can be considered for what the Attorney-General says are exceptional circumstances. I will say some more on that when I move that amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058234"></A>
I will turn to the fallacy, the fabrication--deliberate or otherwise--and the almost deliberate verballing by the Attorney-General about what I have actually indicated in this place. I have no problem with the courts actually handing down their sentence--as they do and as they should appropriately do--but this parliament is the one that is responsible for laying down the guidelines that will guide our courts. If we completely trusted the courts to meet community expectations, if we had absolute faith and confidence in them, we would not have codified criminal law. We would have a common law environment in Queensland where it is up to the courts to decide how to deal with and sentence offenders, as used to exist before the codification of the criminal law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058235"></A>
Every time this government comes into this place and seeks to move an amendment to the Criminal Code, seeks to move an amendment to the Penalties and Sentences Act or seeks to move an amendment to what are now going to be minimum standard non-parole periods--which is all but minimum sentences dressed up in a form of sentencing drag--it is simply restricting and watering down the discretion of the courts. It takes away the courts’ discretion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058236"></A>
The reason for that is that the government is now having to react to the community at large who are seeing some sentences--not the majority but some--which are inconsistently being handed down or have endangered the community as a consequence of the release of a particular person. That is why the government has belatedly been forced to react in this particular way. The reason the Premier had to say in a very grandiose way on Monday that we are going to now have minimum standard non-parole periods is that the community has concerns and community expectation is not being properly met by the courts. As the honourable member for Hinchinbrook said in another debate yesterday, we have had this conversion on the road to Damascus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058237"></A>
The other thing the Attorney did not and could not answer and needs to answer as part of any response is what happened in Victoria when that government tried to address community concerns with regard to what was a worry about the overuse of suspended sentences for repeat and violent offenders. They actually said, ‘We are going to change the laws so you can suspend sentences, but they can only be granted in exceptional circumstances.’ What has all the academic research actually shown since that time? What has all the data actually shown since that time? It has shown--and this comes from people who are experienced in this area--that the courts are now interpreting exceptional circumstances in the most broad way and finding a whole range of ways to get around that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058238"></A>
The rate of release on suspended sentences has not tightened up. If anything, it is the same or getting worse. When the courts have a broad extrapolation of the term ‘exceptional circumstances’, they will always find a way to address what they--and justifiably for them--see as their province--that is, complete judicial discretion. We have to understand that the courts and the judges who sit in courts have rightly been appointed for what is basically a lifetime. Regardless of our political arguments in this place, they do not have to feel the pressure of being re-elected and being directly accountable to the community. They find it quite reprehensible that the actions we take in here--in Victoria in that circumstance--absolutely impugn, mitigate and water down their judicial discretion--that which they see as a birthright of a judicial officer. They find a way of doing it. That is the basis on which they start, and that is fair enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058239"></A>
However, we are the judge of community opinion. We are the people who are out there in our communities hearing their concerns. It is our responsibility to legislate. People will be extremely cynical if a government passes a law which seems to give the community more support and greater security by saying that people can only be released under exceptional circumstances and then nothing really changes--that is, that the courts find a way to interpret exceptional circumstances, as they do. This parliament will have done nothing other than breed justifiable community cynicism. That has been the experience with regard to this particular exceptional circumstance provision. It is a get-out-of-jail-free clause in many ways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058240"></A>
This first amendment relates to the criteria that a judge must consider when actually deciding whether to incarcerate a person. It requires that the judge has to take into consideration the availability of a sex offender rehabilitation program. I think that should be a primary concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058241"></A>
This government talks first and foremost about the issue of rehabilitation. That is fair enough from their viewpoint. I actually also support the notion of rehabilitation but not at the exclusion of community protection, which should be one of the other major considerations. Mixed in amongst that, there has to be an amount of accountability for the person’s actions--that is, punishment for what they have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058242"></A>
Jail should very much be about community protection. It should be about making someone fully accountable and punishing them for their actions and appropriately rehabilitating them. This amendment is about making sure that that rehabilitative environment is front and centre in the judges’ minds when they decide the sentences of offenders. I do not know how anyone would not be prepared to actually support that particular principle. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Wendt): Order! Before calling the Attorney, I would like to acknowledge in the gallery members of the Mount Tamborine Probus Club. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058245"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK: </Hansard-Member-Up>
I also welcome those Queenslanders to their House. Can I just go to the clause first before I respond to the whirling dervish of an address by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition covering a whole range of issues. I might actually deal with the clause first. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058246"></A>
In relation to the amending clause, the inclusion of the exceptional circumstances provision is important. I addressed that in the second reading debate. In the vast majority of these types of cases, it is indeed inconceivable that circumstances exist that may justify an offender not serving time in prison. But the provision in this bill about circumstances is about exceptional circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058247"></A>
The phrase is one with which the courts are familiar. I am of the view that the circumstances that amount to exceptional are better able to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. I do not want to take individualised justice out of our system of justice in Queensland because every case is different, every offender is different, the effect on offenders is different, the nature of offending is different in every case and the circumstances and the antecedents of offenders is different in every case. If we move away from individualised justice, we might as well get rid of the courts and bring offenders here and put them at the bar of the House and tell them what every sentence is going to be by setting a penalty of imprisonment, which is what the LNP wishes to do by introducing mandatory sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058248"></A>
The phrase in the context of this sentencing principle has previously been interpreted by the Court of Appeal. The Chief Justice observed that synonyms for ‘exceptional’ are ‘unusual’ and ‘extraordinary’. Justice Chesterman stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1063243"></A>
To qualify as exceptional, the circumstances of the offender or the offence must be properly identifiable as truly out of the ordinary or extraordinary.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063246"></A>
The Chief Justice and a justice of the Court of Appeal have both said words to that effect. The bill also provides that, in deciding whether there are exceptional circumstances, a court must have regard to the closeness in age between the offender and the child. This will be particularly relevant when sentencing, for example, a young offender for conduct that occurred in the context of a consensual relationship with a partner aged just less than 16 years, and I do not think we should be excluding that from our justice system. The law must be capable of providing a just and appropriate sentence based on all of the facts in a case, most notably where those facts are unusual and extraordinary. As a general principle, the strength of our legal system must be measured not only by its capacity to imprison those who transgress the law but also by whether it is sufficiently robust and fair so as to guard against injustices that might be visited upon the few.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063247"></A>
During the course of the debate the member for Southern Downs, as is his wont, as he often does, completely changed his position from the second reading debate to the clauses. During the debate he made reference to and quoted positively I think, if I am not mistaken, from an article by Bravehearts--a very fine group in the community working with victims of child sexual abuse. He said that that article--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1063251"></A>
... concluded that all sex offenders constitute a real risk to children and that this risk is lifelong.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063252"></A>
The member for Southern Downs quoted that with approval during the debate. If that is his view--if he genuinely believes that all sex offenders constitute a real risk to children and that this risk is lifelong--what possible purpose would rehabilitation form if he genuinely believes that? But maybe he changed his view from the second reading debate to today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063255"></A>
In relation to rehabilitation--and I have asked this in the House before and I am yet to receive a response from the LNP--what is the LNP’s legal advice that says you can detain people in custody until they have very satisfactorily--and it is undetermined what ‘satisfactorily’ means--completed a rehabilitation course? What is the legal authority that says you can detain prisoners indefinitely in Queensland? I am very happy for you to table the advice. I am very happy for you to table the advice of the Senior Counsel or Queen’s Counsel that you have, the constitutional advice. I ask the member for Southern Downs: does he have that advice? Has he ever sought legal advice? That is the policy of the LNP--that sex offenders must be kept in custody until they satisfactorily complete a sexual offenders course. Have you got the advice?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I ask him to table the advice. We fell back on the old get-out-of-jail-free card. We had that. Another slogan that was thrown out there was that individuals who are released on parole--that is, not finished their sentence--are sent out into the community but under strict supervision. That is a get-out-of-jail-free card--suspended sentences, get out of jail, notwithstanding the fact that an individual may be convicted of an offence. That may go on their record. It may damage their prospects of employment for the rest of their life, branding them a criminal. It seems those things do not matter to the LNP--unless, of course, it is jail. I have not been persuaded by the arguments of the Liberal National Party in relation to that matter. I have not been persuaded that excluding exceptional circumstances will lead to more justice in Queensland. In fact, I think it will lead to injustice in our state, and I ask him again to table the advice that says that individuals can be detained in custody indefinitely--contrary to the decision of the High Court and Kable, Fardon and a whole range of other cases. I ask him--</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order, members! The member for Southern Downs has the call.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063288"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Paraphaser, as the honourable member for Kawana said. Nowhere have I ever said that a person can successfully be held ad infinitum beyond the time for which they have been given a finite sentence. Indeed, if the Attorney goes back to the debate that we had in this place a couple of weeks ago on legislation that was supposedly about ensuring that an offender could be kept or monitored for a particular period of time, I said then that I felt that the legislation which the government put in place with regard to serious dangerous sex offenders a number of years ago was probably pushing the envelope as much as one possibly could.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063289"></A>
However, there is another way of doing it, and that is ensuring that all repeat violent sex offenders receive an indefinite sentence at the time of sentencing and then you are able to keep them virtually at Her Majesty’s pleasure. That is how you do it--that is, have the infinite sentence up here and then start to work back from there. That is how you deal with that. I make no excuses for quoting Bravehearts in this place because it was only indicating its concerns about these people not being able to be rehabilitated. I am not sure that it is impossible to rehabilitate all of these people, and I have never said that all of them could never be rehabilitated. However, I have said that there is a track record and history, research and data shows that many of these offenders--a higher rate than any other category of offender--go on to reoffend, so therefore if they are to be released we need to be very concerned about ensuring there are ultimate protection regimes in place for the community at large. That is what I have indicated all the way along completely and absolutely consistently, and if members read what I have said in this place I think they will find verification of that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063291"></A>
I want to explain these two amendments for honourable members. The first amendment relates to adult offenders. It basically says that an adult offender cannot be released by the court until that offender has been sentenced to a period of detention which ensures that they have adequate time to access and complete a rehabilitation program. The Attorney might want to argue about that, but one would actually hope that within a few months in prison there should be available such a program for that person. The amendment does not even prescribe the successful completion of that program, but one would hope that that particular program should be made available to that offender and that that offender should undertake that program. That is what it says. Nowhere does this amendment say that that person is to be kept in prison forever. Nowhere does this amendment say that. I have previously said that I have no problems with the Bravehearts proposition that subsequent serious violent sex offenders--that is, people who have offended, been to prison and do it again--should be locked up indefinitely. I have no problem with that whatsoever. I support that absolutely, but that is not what this amendment is about because this deals with the sentencing of potentially first-time offenders. The amendment does not prescribe that particular period, so therefore the issue of legal advice is an absolute erroneous argument.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063292"></A>
The subsequent amendment relates to the issue of how we deal with juvenile offenders. I understand that there may be this circumstance, even though the Attorney has not provided statistics, where somebody young might be maintaining what has otherwise been a consensual relationship with some childhood sweetheart and they come into the age where they can be held criminally responsible. Therefore, this amendment seeks to limit that particular judicial discretion which the government says is exceptional circumstances in the case of juveniles only. That is the next amendment which I intend to move.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063329"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I want to make just a short contribution. I understand where the member for Southern Downs is coming from in terms of the amendment to clause 5, which removes ‘unless there are exceptional circumstances’ to ensure that an offender who is serving a custodial sentence should have and should be made to have adequate time to access and complete a rehabilitation program. It is a difficult job to get perpetrators incarcerated for sex crimes, especially against children. But it is difficult for the victims of those crimes to see a perpetrator perhaps get a custodial sentence but during that time never once admit their guilt. So they do not do a sex crimes rehabilitation program. They come out and still claim their innocence, and that is devastating for victims of those types of crimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063331"></A>
However, I am concerned about removing ‘unless there are exceptional circumstances’. It is important to go to clause 5A to see what the Attorney-General means by ‘exceptional circumstances’. I am not a lawyer--there are plenty of those in here--but I am assuming that the example in clause 5A would be used by the courts to interpret the intent of this legislation. The clause states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1063334"></A>
... a court may have regard to the closeness in age between the offender and the child. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063335"></A>
So if the child is a 14- or 15-year-old person and they have an active sexual relationship with another person who may be 17 or 18, the courts would have regard to exceptional circumstances--and I believe that the Attorney-General has already confirmed that and I value that confirmation. I understand from talking with the shadow minister, the member for Southern Downs, that his exemption would be only in those circumstances where both offenders were below the age of majority that is recognised in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063336"></A>
I am using the term ‘exceptional circumstances’, and I hope that is what the minister means and intends in his bill, but I am concerned that there could be people who are over the age of 17 or 18 and who should be dealt with as juveniles simply because of their state of mind--not because they are diagnosed as having any kind of impairment but because of their state of mind. I would like to think that judges would have some discretion to be able to take into account the circumstances and the state of mind of all of the participants in the incident. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063337"></A>
I am not in any way, shape or form condoning or agreeing with or saying that it is in any way acceptable for harm to be done to children, but I do not support mandatory sentencing for the reason--and I have already said this in a previous debate--that there are at times circumstances of mitigation or provocation that the courts need to be able to consider. I am very concerned that if ‘exceptional circumstances’ is removed altogether it could mean that somebody will have their life impacted--or both parties--when perhaps the matter should have been considered differently.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063338"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Gladstone for her thoughtful contribution to the debate on this clause. I think she has really summarised the argument very well in the sense that we need to retain the ability of the court on a discretionary basis to consider who falls outside this sort of principle. It is a significant principle to say that anyone who commits a sex offence against an individual under the age of 16 years must serve an actual term of imprisonment. An ‘actual term of imprisonment’ is defined in the legislation to require somebody to serve time in a custodial facility. So it is a very important matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063340"></A>
 I acknowledge the point that the member for Gladstone made about someone with perhaps an impairment of mind which might mean that their adult age may be a certain age but their functioning age may be less. Those individuals may not necessarily go into the formal criminal justice system--they may go into the mental health system--but I think the argument that the member makes is a very important one. I have said, probably in different ways during the debate, that we must always admit discretion into the system. If we do not, we go down a very rocky and dark path towards mandatory sentencing, which will have unjust results for individuals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063341"></A>
On the issue of what is ‘exceptional circumstances’, I do not know whether the honourable member was here earlier to hear the debate on the clause, but I made reference earlier to how I do not think it is possible to define in legislation what exceptional circumstances are. I think you need to look at it on a case-by-case basis, but by saying ‘exceptional circumstances’ it already narrows the field.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063342"></A>
In short compass I point out to the member for Gladstone that the Chief Justice has observed previously that synonyms for ‘exceptional’ are ‘unusual’ and ‘extraordinary’ and that encompasses the cases that we have been talking about earlier about someone who may not function at the same level as other individuals because of an impairment of some description. Justice Chesterman, who is a justice of the Court of Appeal, has stated that to qualify as ‘exceptional’ the circumstances of the offender or the offence must be properly identifiable as truly out of the ordinary or extraordinary. So we have ‘unusual’, ‘extraordinary’ and ‘out of the ordinary’ and you have to identify that criteria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063344"></A>
So this is a very significant thing. Effectively, we are enshrining that sentencing principle that the Court of Appeal has adopted for the best part of a decade and a half in Queensland. But it makes it crystal clear in legislation that those who offend against children in a sexual nature should spend an actual period of time in imprisonment. I hope that clarifies the issue for the honourable member. I agree with the honourable member when it comes to the enormous frustration that victims of crime in particular but also members of the general community feel about individuals--not just individuals who commit sex offences but anyone who offends and who is convicted of a crime--who forever proclaim their innocence. In fact, that happens in Queensland courts all the time. I am sure that as recently as yesterday in a court in Queensland there were individuals who were proclaiming their innocence notwithstanding a conviction. That is deeply frustrating for people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063345"></A>
The balance there, of course, is that individuals are autonomous, free people and, no matter what the offending, some people will never admit to their guilt. In fact, there is a saying that is often heard in the Queensland legal profession that there are many prisoners who believe they are innocent and they constantly proclaim their innocence, notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that may have convicted them. That is very frustrating. I do not know how you can change that. I do not know how you can change people. We have a very significant number of programs that are offered in prisons. Often the best way to change people is by people making the decision to change their own lives, as I am sure the honourable member would accept and would have experience of. But how you get people to make that decision is the great challenge, I think, sometimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063346"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
In response to the member for Gladstone’s concerns--and I acknowledge that they are consistent and heartfelt--I just want to explain these two amendments again. This first amendment would indicate that a person is not eligible for exceptional circumstances if they are an adult offender and they would have to be sentenced to a period of incarceration which would see them have adequate time in which to complete a rehabilitation program. I could have put in ‘compulsorily’ complete a rehabilitation program, but I have not done that. So it is ‘complete a rehabilitation program’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063347"></A>
The next amendment, which I intend to move, will make it clear that that particular provision does not apply to those who are juvenile offenders. The honourable member may feel that that amendment still restricts the discretion of the court too much and may feel that there may be circumstances in which those people who are outside the category of juvenile offender--that is, those people who are aged 17 years and over--should also be subject to that circumstance of exception, which I am seeking to clarify in regard to this particular legislation. However, that debate about the age at which somebody is a juvenile and the age at which somebody is no longer a juvenile is a debate that we have not really had in this parliament. Certainly, that debate has been held in other jurisdictions around Australia from time to time. Occasionally, the issue raises its head in a bit of byplay in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063348"></A>
I keep reading the clause over and over again. The government’s clause 5, which is the next one that I am hoping to have amended--and obviously on the numbers I would imagine that is not going to happen with the government refusing to support it--says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1063350"></A>
For subsection (5)(b), in deciding whether there are exceptional circumstances, a court may have regard to the closeness in age between the offender and the child. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063384"></A>
It does not say ‘must only have regard’, it says ‘may have regard’. My subsequent amendment will seek to ensure that that is the circumstance, by classifying that it could only apply to a juvenile offender. If the government does not like it maybe it should move another amendment in this place and say that it is the age criteria that should be the consideration for exceptional circumstances. That has been the only argument that the government has been able to use here and in the community: you have to consider the issue of statutory rape and the age difference of the offender. That is what it keeps talking about. There does not seem to be any other extrapolation of exceptional circumstance. If that is the issue then the government should move an amendment to ensure that it only relates to an age criteria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063385"></A>
I suggest that the honourable member for Gladstone and other honourable members here--and this point has not been able to be undermined in any way by the Attorney--look at what the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council, a very similar body to this one that the Attorney is establishing today, has said about what happened in that state when they put an exceptional circumstances clause into the application of suspended sentencing. They reviewed it and said that the judiciary found all sorts of ways to define and utilise the terminology ‘exceptional circumstances’, so it did not really change anything. There was no significant reduction in the number of suspended sentences that were being applied to offenders in the circumstances that they were hoping to avoid. Judges found a way to extrapolate and define exceptional circumstances to go about doing the things that they were always doing and wanted to do, as is their wont and as is their right as historically judges have been able to do because of their judicial discretion. That is the concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063386"></A>
I say to the honourable member for Gladstone that I suspect--and I hope I am wrong--that at some time in the future we will be having a debate in this place after a review by the Sentencing Advisory Council, or someone else who collects this data, finds that exceptional circumstances are applied in very broad circumstances well outside of what the government has been seeking to talk about as its only safe haven to justify this, and that is the relative closeness of age when it comes to the offender and the victim. This is much broader than what one would think and we should at least be defining that in a way so that it is not open to abuse. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank the member for Southern Downs for introducing his amendments. My understanding is that by introducing those amendments it has put on the parliamentary record, not only for the records of parliament but also for the judiciary should it come to pass that the judiciary need some clarification, what the Attorney-General is intending. There will be an opportunity for clarification by reference specifically to the amendments the member for Southern Downs has moved, the questions he has asked, the comments made by my colleague the member for Gladstone, and the comments made by the Attorney-General and other members during this consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063388"></A>
During my contribution earlier I made the comment that I was looking forward to this stage of the debate so that we could better flesh out what was intended both by the opposition in the opposition’s amendment and also better clarification of the wording of the bill that the Attorney-General has proposed. I am comfortable with proceeding and supporting the Attorney-General in his proposal. I believe that the concerns that the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Southern Downs, has raised will certainly send a very clear message to the judiciary. The way that the Attorney-General has responded should also send a very clear message to the judiciary. If they need any clarification as to what is intended, simply refer to the debate on this bill and the debate on the clauses. There should be no doubt what is intended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063389"></A>
I am flagging that I am intending to support my colleague, the member for Gladstone, and the Attorney-General in his proposal and not support the member for Southern Downs. If the shadow Attorney-General’s concerns are realised, I am more than happy, if I happen to be returned at the next election, to stand in this chamber and support further refinement and amendments. If it comes to pass that the judiciary ignores the very clear direction that this parliament is making, we have a responsibility to review and further refine the legislation and the directions that we provide to the judiciary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063390"></A>
I will be supporting my colleague, the member for Gladstone. I thank her for her contribution. Can I say that boys of 17 years of age may be at different stages of maturity. Some may well be beyond their years and others may be far below it. I personally believe that we need to ensure that the judiciary does have the capacity to exercise its discretion. I believe the Attorney-General has clarified very clearly what we are intending to achieve. Again, I thank the shadow Attorney-General for introducing these clauses and I look forward to the debate on the further amendments that he intends to move to provide clarification and, can I say, very clear direction to the judiciary on the way this parliament wants these amendments to be interpreted. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Nicklin for his contribution. There is one matter I would seek to clarify. Earlier in the debate I had said that my understanding was that the Liberal National Party had stated publicly previously that sexual offenders should not be released unless they had completed a sexual offender’s rehabilitation course. I asked the member for Southern Downs on what basis did they hold the view that Queensland courts would be committed to do that and I asked him to table advice. Of course, he resorted to seeking to criticise me by saying I was verballing him. For the benefit of the parliament and all Queenslanders, on 16 July this year in a quote in a media release issued by the member for Southern Downs--and these words are in a quote, they are not paraphrased, they are attributed to him--the member for Southern Downs stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1063393"></A>
Repeat sex offenders who commit further offences should be jailed and made to complete rehabilitation programs and prove they are no longer a risk before they are released back into the community. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063394"></A>
The reality is that the policy position of the Liberal National Party is that repeat sexual offenders must be made--it is a mandatory process--to complete a rehabilitation program and prove they are no longer a risk before they are released. So it is continuing detention unless the convicted offender can do that. He should not be saying that that is not the policy of the LNP when clearly it is. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (4.14 pm), by leave: I would like to respond to issues raised in the Bundaberg<Hansard-Italic>
 NewsMail</Hansard-Italic>
 today, supported by the member for Burnett, by a number of consumers affected by the collapse of Coral Coast Homes and/or Steel Smart Homes. At the outset let me say that, after Coral Coast Homes collapsed, the BSA paid out $1.3 million in insurance claims in 28 claims. So the suggestion that nothing was done for those people is simply incorrect and can be proven to be incorrect, and it ought to be recanted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068771"></A>
I wish to firstly advise the House that, as a company conducting construction work, Coral Coast Homes held a BSA licence while Steel Smart Homes, as a supplier of kit homes, did not require one. This is why the Building Services Authority took action for homeowners affected by the collapse of Coral Coast Homes and the Office of Fair Trading took action against Steel Smart Homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068776"></A>
It is disappointing to see successful claimants of the BSA’s Home Warranty Insurance Scheme criticising the BSA. As they have decided to complain to the media, I feel it only right that I explain what has been done to assist them. Senior BSA staff personally met with many claimants and guided them through the process to secure payments under the scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068778"></A>
These critics include Mr Denis Seth, who contracted Steel Smart Homes to supply a kit home and Coral Coast Homes to construct it. I am informed that Mr Seth was offered the chance to have his home completed at no cost to him by another licensed builder selected through a tender process. So he was offered to have his home completed by a licensed builder at no cost to him, and what did Mr Seth do? He declined to do so. He declined this offer and chose to complete the home as an owner-builder. As such, he chose to provide his own labour, thereby excluding him from claiming it as an expense under the scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068780"></A>
Mr Seth agreed to these terms prior to restarting work on his house, knowing he could not be reimbursed for his personal expenses. The BSA assisted Mr Seth to the full extent of the agreement but, despite this and after receiving almost $46,000 under the scheme, he has complained he is out of pocket after completing his home. No-one forced him to become an owner-builder. He chose to do that himself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068782"></A>
The article also quotes Nola Binder, who built with Coral Coast Homes, as saying the BSA payment ‘eventually covered her cost but she went in circles trying to get help’. Let us look at the facts. Ms Binder claims that the BSA was not interested in her claim until political pressure occurred. This is plainly incorrect, given that she lodged a non-completion claim on 19 June 2009 and an inspection of her property by BSA inspectors occurred four days later--just four days later. She received approval of--wait for it--$71,833 within two months, allowing for work to recommence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068784"></A>
I just recently made an insurance claim myself and I had to wait about five months. It was a personal item that was lost--an iPad as a matter of fact. I claimed insurance on that and I had to wait four or five months to get all of the evidence correct and all the rest of it. It is not unusual for people to have to wait a period of time. I would suggest that two months is not that long. I do appreciate that it is difficult circumstances for people but to suggest that there was no help available is simply incorrect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068786"></A>
Another customer of Coral Coast Homes, David Kapp, also made a number of allegations in the article. I am advised Kapp entered into a contract with Coral Coast Homes for the supply and construction of a kit home for $134,607 on 13 February 2008. On 19 January 2009, Kapp terminated the contract before the house was completed, and took up occupancy. The amount paid by Kapp under the contract before termination was $121,434, leaving $13,173 in his own pocket unpaid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068788"></A>
Mr Kapp later lodged a defect claim in relation to plumbing and drainage work. On top of the defects claim, Mr Kapp claimed liquidated damages, personal costs to remove trees, loss due to damage to a fence and legal costs. In relation to the defective plumbing work, Mr Kapp has been advised that, as he still retains $13,173 of the contract price, the insurance scheme will only pay any cost overrun beyond the $13,173. You cannot double dip. However, Kapp has not provided any further information and the BSA is of the belief that Kapp cannot substantiate expenses in excess of the $13,173. All Mr Kapp has to do is to provide the evidence. The BSA, like every other insurer, requires evidence before it pays out. Kapp has never provided that evidence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068790"></A>
Today’s Bundaberg <Hansard-Italic>
NewsMail</Hansard-Italic>
 also mentions Chris Dalby, an owner-builder. Let me advise the House that owner-builders are not provided with cover under the Home Warranty Insurance Scheme, and this is made very clear to them on the owner-builder application form. Dalby purchased a kit home in 2008 from materials supplier Steel Smart Homes, who are not required to hold a BSA licence. He did not have a contract with construction company Coral Coast Homes, and as an owner-builder was well aware of the risks and his responsibility when he applied for the permit. In other words, Dalby is trying to claim an insurance payout for a policy he has not purchased. Even the most basic understanding of insurance tells us that you cannot claim insurance if you do not have a policy and have not paid a premium. I wonder who needs a reality check on that issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073816"></A>
If the Bundaberg<Hansard-Italic>
 NewsMail</Hansard-Italic>
 editor believes that people who do not pay for a policy are entitled to insurance cover, all I can say is that that is a novel idea. The fact is that kit homes are not covered by the BSA and nor will they be, and anyone who owner-builds one knows this. Owner-builders are not covered, and they again know that. Yet Mr Seth, with the support of the <Hansard-Italic>
NewsMail</Hansard-Italic>
 editor, continues to try to claim for something that he is not entitled to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073821"></A>
Ms Binder got $71,833 from the Home Warranty Insurance Scheme within two months of claiming, yet the editor of the <Hansard-Italic>
NewsMail</Hansard-Italic>
 claims that the BSA gave not one iota of help. The Bundaberg<Hansard-Italic>
 NewsMail</Hansard-Italic>
 wants the BSA insurance to pay Mr Kapp, who refuses to provide evidence of his claims. One wonders if this is the official position of APN. Is it really their view that insurance should be paid when there is no supporting evidence given by people about it? I do not think most sensible people would believe that. I certainly do not believe that APN would have a policy that says that if you do not have any evidence you should be paid.</Hansard-Body>

 today say in the story that they got a payment from the BSA. One said they were very happy with it. The other people have had extensive dealings with the BSA. The editor’s claim that not one iota of help came from the state government is contradicted by her own paper, and one wonders if she reads her own front page. The facts speak for themselves. <Hansard-Speech-End>

‘(5A)	However, if the offender is convicted as a child under the <Hansard-Italic>
Youth Justice Act 1992</Hansard-Italic>
, subsection (5) does not apply if the court is satisfied exceptional circumstances exist.’.’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073833"></A>
As I indicated when I spoke previously, there has been a significant assertion from the government, the Attorney and other people during this debate that this particular exceptional circumstance clause should generally only apply when there is a not insignificant age difference between the offender and the victim--that is, if they have been involved in some sort of sweetheart juvenile relationship and it would be unjust to actually punish them in such a way. This amendment seeks to ensure that the circumstances under which a person can be considered for exceptional circumstances only relate to the case of juvenile offenders and I believe prescribes those circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073834"></A>
 It is important to establish these facts. If indeed the Attorney is concerned that this is such a problem, I would like the Attorney to provide this parliament with some figures on how many of these people are actually charged each year in Queensland and how many of these people are successfully prosecuted each year in Queensland. An existing amount of discretion is being used by both the Queensland Police Service in choosing whether to investigate and charge these cases--that is beyond doubt--and the Director of Public Prosecutions in choosing whether to actually prosecute those cases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073837"></A>
If members think what I am saying is wrong, I draw their attention to the 2008-09 annual report of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. With regard to the decision to prosecute, page 40 talks about public interest criteria. It states that they consider ‘the youth, age, physical or mental health or special infirmity of the alleged offender or a necessary witness’. So ‘youth’ would indicate that they already consider anyone who is classified as a youth, and I would imagine that does not necessarily even prescribe it to where I am trying to prescribe it, which is ‘juvenile’. I think anyone up to the age of 18 or 19 in Queensland is considered to be a youth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073839"></A>
It is quite conceivable, under those prosecutorial guidelines which are now being used by the Director of Public Prosecutions to look at the prosecution of offenders, that we could have a situation in Queensland where somebody who is 18 years of age and who is maintaining a consensual relationship with somebody who falls in the category of somebody who can be offended against may not be prosecuted because of those particular exceptional circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073842"></A>
Further, page 43 at section 5(v)(b) states that anyone who is a child should not necessarily be prosecuted in a range of circumstances, and one of them is ‘for sexual experimentation involving children of similar ages in consensual activity’. If the Attorney is going to continue to proffer this argument that there is such a problem with regard to people being charged and pursued through the prosecutorial process and indeed sentenced in our courts because they have maintained a consensual relationship and they are very close in age and they are young people, then I think it behoves the Attorney to indicate to this parliament how many of these circumstances he is aware of.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073843"></A>
Over the last few days of this argument we have seen something we could all be concerned about--that is, the undue and unjust prosecution of one young person when two young people have been in a relationship where one of them is not at the age of consent and the other is at the age of consent but they have their own version of juvenile love. If that is the case, the Attorney needs to explain to the parliament. Otherwise, it is a very cynical argument to couch what is a very, very broad get-out-of-jail-free card in very emotional terms and use the emotional excuse which is being used in this parliament to try to make members balk at refining or even doing away with exceptional circumstances criteria altogether.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073844"></A>
I think the Attorney needs to give this parliament some idea of how many times we have seen these sorts of relationships. I am not talking about a violent circumstance, where somebody at the age of 17 has actually set out and had unlawful carnal knowledge of somebody under the age of consent, or indeed even somebody who is 15 years of age who has sexually abused somebody of a similar age. We are talking here about consensual sexual relationships between youth where there are these so-called unjust circumstances. I think it is very necessary for the Attorney to clarify it to this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073846"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The reality is that there are two choices in the criminal justice system and in the courts: either you have discretion or you do not. In the amendment put forward--and I will go to the heart of this amendment shortly--the opposition does not want discretion in sentencing courts. During the debate we had this denigration of the DPP by the member opposite, including on plea bargaining and how people were getting out of jail free. He was criticising the exercise of discretion by prosecutors in the debate, and now he says that discretion is fine: ‘There’s nothing wrong with that. That’s what the guidelines provide.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073847"></A>
The reality is that opposition members wish to take discretion out of the system altogether by the amendments put forward by the member for Southern Downs. By doing so, they will distort the justice system. His own argument proves the case because what will happen is that police prosecutors and staff in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will use the guidelines to find a way around prosecuting offences where this is a mandatory sentence. That has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions where mandatory sentencing has been imposed. By his own argument he proves the case.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073849"></A>
Let us go to the heart of what the opposition wants to do with this amendment. The reality is that the Penalties and Sentences Act does not apply to juveniles. Members only have to read section 6 of the act to know that this very act does not apply to juveniles. The Youth Justice Act applies to juveniles. What the member is trying to do is exclude the operation of the Youth Justice Act by this second amendment when it does not apply in the first place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079069"></A>
I was criticised during the debate for being embarrassing in amendments brought into this House. This is a spectacular example of the laziness and the ignorance of this long-term opposition. Why? Because the member for Southern Downs is the shadow attorney-general and the shadow minister responsible for the youth justice system. He knows that he is responsible for both acts, the Penalties and Sentences Act and the Youth Justice Act, and he does not even know how they operate. He comes in here and presumes to lecture the government about what is embarrassing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079074"></A>
The reality is that this amendment is a complete nonsense when regard is had to the provisions of the Penalties and Sentences Act. Section 6 of the Penalties and Sentences Act expressly provides that the act does not apply to a child. It is not hard to read. It is about the 16th or 17th page or, if you take out the index at the front, it is about page 4 or 5 of the act. Section 6 of the Penalties and Sentences Act expressly provides that the act does not apply to a child within the meaning of the Youth Justice Act. It is the Youth Justice Act that governs the sentencing of juveniles in Queensland. We have used one example of what a court might regard as exceptional circumstances, and it is a very important example. That is why it has been put in the legislation. It is important to make exclusions for young people coming into the criminal justice system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079080"></A>
Firstly, the act does not apply to juveniles and we have set an example of a 17-year-old who, I would hope the honourable member knows, would be sentenced as an adult in Queensland. So the Penalties and Sentences Act applies to people 17 years or older. The reality is that we need to carve out that exclusion. We cannot completely define exceptional circumstances, nor would the government. We let qualified judges do that. It is a spectacular failure by the member for Southern Downs to understand the operation of the Penalties and Sentences Act and its interaction with the Youth Justice Act. This is an embarrassing amendment that should not be before the parliament. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In amongst all of the Attorney’s puffery, which is probably more synonymous with the previous Attorney in this place, he has still failed to actually provide the statistics for which we have asked in this place. How many examples have we actually seen of these circumstances in Queensland? How many young people, supposedly in some form of consensual relationship, have been caught up in the application of statutory rape and, therefore, have been unfairly, improperly or unjustly prosecuted in Queensland? Listening to the Attorney over the last 24 to 48 hours we would think that we would see the floodgates open if the government does not put in an exceptional circumstances clause because there are all these young people in Queensland maintaining what are otherwise known as loving, consensual relationships, albeit a criminal one. He has not been able to point to this plethora of examples across the state of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079087"></A>
Nowhere have I ever said that we argue against the issue of the prosecution being able to consider the individual and special circumstances when deciding whether to prosecute somebody. The issue of prosecution is totally different from the issue of being forced to plea bargain because they do not necessarily have the resources. The prosecution is at a disadvantage because in many cases the defence is at an advantage over the prosecution in Queensland both in seniority and resources. So they try to cut a deal and get what they can. I think very few people would argue that that has not been the case with regard to the pursuit of Gabriel Watson in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079089"></A>
I simply asked the question and the Attorney has not touched on it. Currently, a prosecutorial guideline exists in Queensland that says that the prosecution can consider the youth, age, physical or mental health, or special infirmity of the alleged offender or a necessary witness. I would be arguing at the moment that, notwithstanding the discretion the police have in looking at these issues, if it then goes to the DPP, they would be considering those factors. As I indicated in this debate yesterday, I am personally aware--and I am sure many other members are also aware--of a teenage girl in our community becoming pregnant and we know that her partner is much older, not under the age of 16, but 17 or 18, and would not have been pursued because of the nature of that particular relationship. What we have here is the government trying to couch some sort of emotional excuse which tugs at the heartstrings of everyone here as a justification as to why it is prepared to leave a ‘get out of jail free’ clause in this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079091"></A>
The other issue that the Attorney has not addressed here today, despite being asked over and over again, relates to the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council. When it looked at the exceptional circumstances clause which existed for the use of suspended sentences in that state, it concluded that the judiciary was interpreting exceptional circumstances very broadly. Indeed, there had been little change in the number of people who had been given suspended sentences in Victoria before they made the change of exceptional circumstances compared with after. That is what happens in reality.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079093"></A>
If the Attorney does not like a particular clause and if the Attorney tends to want to fret about the relative closeness in age of the so-called offender and the victim, then the Attorney should prescribe. If he does not like our amendment, if he says it is an embarrassment then he should go and prescribe it because it is all he has been talking about. He has not been able to give one other practical example of exceptional circumstances other than the close ages of the alleged offender and the person who is the alleged victim. He should tighten it up so that the court must only consider circumstances of the closeness of age between the victim and the offender. That is not there. This is an excuse for having a ‘get out of jail free’ clause from a government that wants to be seen to be acting tough but knowing, in effect, that after it passes this legislation today nothing is going to change the application of this law by the courts in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (4.46 pm): The LNP will be supporting the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill 2010. When I adjourned the second reading debate some two weeks ago, I remarked on the bill being a riveting piece of legislation. But, on reflection, that was perhaps not the best description of the bill and somewhat unfair to all those who work on the sometimes thankless task of regulatory reform. To those people I do want to say thank you, because I do appreciate the hard work involved. I also thank Cathy and Eleanor, who provided some information and assistance, and the Treasurer’s office for providing some answers to questions we raised in the briefing. I record my thanks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084317"></A>
I want to touch on the issue of regulatory reform before moving on to the discussion of the provisions of this legislation which, at its heart, is about the seamless national economy. Since the 1980s Australia has undergone a period of sustained and sweeping structural reforms. These have in the main been supported by both sides of politics--not always, perhaps unfortunately, but in the main. It has often been described as the reform consensus. Massive change has occurred in the way our economy works. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084319"></A>
Until that change, what Paul Kelly from the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 described as the ‘Australian settlement’ ruled. That regime was a highly regulated, anticompetitive and redistributive regime that probably, as Gary Banks from the Productivity Commission described it, is best summed up as protection all round. Manufacturers were protected, unions were protected, consumers were supposedly protected and we lived in this happy state of affairs quite comfortably up until the 1970s. Then there was a need for change when the oil shock came through and we found that we were not quite as competitive as we thought we might have been. We found that Australia was not the lucky country that it had been. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084322"></A>
What often seems like common-sense change to an economist or to a financial commentator is often more complex for the legislators charged with delivering an acceptable policy outcome for the community. Unfortunately, that does lead to occasional forays into populism, mainly from extremes on the politic wings--mainly, might I say, from the old Socialist Left, who like the idea of feather-bedding and vested interest, where patronage and power reside as happy bedfellows. Of course, the full cost of protectionism and excessive and bad regulation is borne by the whole community in the form of higher prices, lack of innovation, barriers to entry by new business, loss of new jobs from new industries and, most importantly for us in Australia and Queensland, a decline in real income. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084324"></A>
Nevertheless, over the last two decades Australia has transformed from a small, protected, inwardly focused economy benefiting from entrenched interests and loud minorities to a diversified, outward-looking trading economy that has boosted productivity and incomes and, importantly, has increased its resilience--its ability to stand shocks throughout the global economy. Productivity has also changed markedly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084325"></A>
According to the Productivity Commission, Australia was ranked fifth in the world in 1950 in terms of GDP per person and had fallen to ninth by 1973 and as low as 15th by the late 1980s. We have to ask how Australia and how Queensland would have been able to compete with those sorts of productivity numbers--15th in the world--especially against emerging economies like China, India and other near Asia tigers. How would we have been able to make our way in the world if our productivity was continuing to decline while those closest to us were growing and growing rapidly? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089579"></A>
So after structural reforms our labour productivity growth came to exceed even that of the benchmark of the United States and this led to income growth of around 2 per cent during the decade of the 1990s, well above the OECD average of 1.7 per cent for the decade, and Australia’s per capita GDP--that is, our productivity--rose from 15th back up to eighth. There is certainly a very strong case for micro-economic reform and there is a strong case that micro-economic reform has been the real driver of Australia’s recent productivity growth--that productivity growth through the nineties supported, I might say, by both sides of politics in the main--and regulatory reform is a substantial component of that micro-economic reform. It is one component of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089584"></A>
What we find out and what we know through careful analysis and investigation is that regulation is not free. It is an activity, particularly an activity of government, that comes with a price. At the federal level, the Productivity Commission estimated that government agencies with explicit regulatory functions employed more than 30,000 staff and spent some $4 billion in 2001-02 administering those regulations. There is also of course the role of state and territory regulation, which is not included in those numbers that have been prepared by the Productivity Commission, and it is possibly the case that state and territory regulation is more intrusive on a day-to-day basis and covers more activities. So truly the hand of government intrudes everywhere. From home to work to holidays, there will be a regulation and it costs a lot of money. Getting a sense of the full cost of regulation is extremely difficult over and above the $4 billion and the 30,000 people directly attributed to it by the Productivity Commission at the federal level. The commission assessed regulatory compliance costs for businesses of around $11 billion in 1994-95, with small and medium sized enterprises bearing 85 per cent of the cost. Those numbers give us a sense of just how big an effect bad regulations have on our economy and the free working of our economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089586"></A>
The current state government pays lip-service to the idea of regulatory efficiency and indeed Budget Paper No. 2 on page 55 sets out the government’s statement on regulatory efficiency, and it is there that we find reference to the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy--this document that I have here--and it is that agreement that has led to the bill that we are debating here today. As we talk about regulatory reform and as we debate a bill that is in fact dealing with regulatory reform, perhaps it is also opportune to look at the most recent report of the Queensland Office for Regulatory Efficiency, QORE. According to its website, the office is meant to lead a program of regulatory reform designed to increase the productivity and competitiveness of Queensland and to enhance the attractiveness of Queensland to individuals and business investment. When we look at that statement, I think it is important that we test it and we ask the question: does the Queensland Office for Regulatory Efficiency actually do those things that it says on its website it wants to do--increase productivity and competitiveness and enhance the attractiveness of business investment?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089592"></A>
In its latest nine-page report--the first page is a nice big picture of a building and there is a foreword by the Treasurer, so we are down to seven pages of effective report--the Treasurer claims $67 million in savings for the 2008-09 year as part of the outcomes, if you like, of the regulatory reform process. But of that $67 million that has been quantified, $60 million of it did not actually come from regulatory reform; it came from the early abolition of mortgage duty and revised land tax thresholds. So it was not about making the regulation process any easier. It was not about reducing the regulatory complexity. It was not about removing regulations. It was about the announcements that had already been made about land tax and mortgage duty. That is $60 million of the $67 million taken out of the equation as this government attempts to achieve a $150 million saving to government and business through regulatory reform.</Hansard-Body>

The next largest saving of $3.3 million comes from a new plan to get the best from procurement spending--not actually getting the best from procurement spending but to have a plan about doing it.

Agency reform initiatives to reduce the regulatory burdens on business, community and government are to be set out in agency regulatory simplification plans and focused on opportunities to reduce unnecessary and excessive legislative requirements, and streamline administrative and procurement processes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1089606"></A>
So all we have here at this stage of proceedings is a plan to have a plan to have phase 1 of the plan prepared, and then we have phase 2 agencies that are meant to commence their simplification plan in 2010.</Hansard-Body-Continued>

This report is a report on a lack of achievement. This is a report that fudges the numbers. This is a report that shows that this government has quite clearly squibbed its responsibilities and is failing to obtain the full benefits of regulatory reform. While it may not be easy, it seems no comprehensive report of the number of regulations in Queensland has been compiled, nor has any assessment of the number of regulations removed from the statutes--removed from operation--ever been reported. The number of regulations may not necessarily be the best measure of whether there is regulatory burden on business and on Queenslanders, but surely it would do to start off with us having a reported number that tells us how many regulations affect business and Queenslanders in their daily lives.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089609"></A>
It is time for more and better regulatory reform in Queensland to lighten the burden on business and make our economy as competitive and free flowing as it can be while providing the necessary protection to community and environment. That is why I constantly advocate the need for a new round of regulation review in Queensland, one that is championed by a government that is not enthralled to its union paymasters--the promoters of the closed shop--but a government dedicated to more private endeavour, more innovation and more employment, sustainable long-term employment, and the government that can deliver on those reforms is an LNP government. No-one should, and I certainly do not, underestimate the difficulty of regulatory reform, both in terms of vested interests and sheer complexity. It is incumbent on elected representatives to understand what it involves, what the regulatory reforms require and to explain the benefits as well as the changes the community should expect.</Hansard-Body>

For those interested in knowing a little more on the subject, I can recommend two books. The first is a collection of public speeches--and I know people will be enthralled to know that there are books written on regulatory reform and how to enhance our competitive basis--by Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, titled <Hansard-Italic>
An economy-wide view: Speeches on structural reform.</Hansard-Italic>
 Members can get that book out at the library. I have it in my desk here. It was sent to me and it actually sits beside my bed at night-time now. The Premier obviously wants some more light reading, so I will send her a complimentary copy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094977"></A>
The other book that might help is a little older and it is called <Hansard-Italic>
One More Nail</Hansard-Italic>
 by a former Liberal politician from South Australia called Bert Kelly, who was a longstanding Liberal member for the seat of Wakefield in South Australia and who pushed for tariff reform. As a farmer, he knew firsthand just how debilitating protectionism and regulatory burden was for Australia and Australians. Both of these books cover the subject in their own way and both of them make clear the benefits of economic reform, particularly micro-economic reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094980"></A>
That is the sort of framework within which the current bill that we are debating is set--the framework of micro-economic reform, regulatory reform and economic reform--and which is designed to achieve productivity growth not for its own sake but for the benefit that it provides for all of us who are living in Australia, which is a small trading country that is trade exposed to the rest of the world. We cannot be an inward-looking economy. We cannot rely on our own production; we have to trade with the rest of the world. We have to get the best terms that we possibly can.</Hansard-Body>

 That includes reform across-the-board. We know that the Labor Party opposed economic reform in the late 1990s as it sought to get some popular gain. Whether it was a free trade agreement, whether it was labour market reform or whether it was tax reform, at that time it chose the cheap, shallow popular path in order to achieve its own aims. </Hansard-Body>

This bill gives effect to the COAG intergovernmental agreement that was signed in April 2009 for the establishment of a national licensing system as part of the agreement to deliver a seamless national economy. The national licensing system will initially be applied to seven broad occupational areas: air conditioning and refrigeration; electrical; plumbing and gasfitting; property related occupations; building and building related occupations; land transport, including passenger vehicle drivers, taxidrivers and bus drivers--those types of operations--and dangerous goods; and maritime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094994"></A>
The air conditioning and refrigeration, electrical, plumbing and gasfitting and property related occupations will be the first four groups of occupations that will be covered by the national licensing scheme, beginning on 1 July 2012. The remaining three groups of occupations--building and building related occupations, land transport and maritime--are currently contemplated to be added to the national licensing scheme sometime after July 2013. But I should point out that there is no guarantee that that will be the case. That is currently the contemplation. As I understand it, there is a lot more work yet to be done and I suspect that some of that work may well be affected by the make-up and composition of the new federal parliament and what the federal government is able to achieve.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094995"></A>
The occupations chosen to be included in the system are ones that were identified as being important to the economy in terms of the level of demand for those jobs, the intrinsic mobility of the people who are in those occupations, the number of licensees and where existing mutual recognition agreements between the states and territories were simply not working. The mobility of workers and the ability of Queensland businesses to attract skilled workers are important for a well-functioning labour market and for productivity growth. Perhaps the experience is none more so than in Queensland and Western Australia, where the demand for trades and skilled workers is as high as we have experienced in a long time. We know what happened in 2007 as we completed, if you like, the run-up to the mining boom. We had capacity constraints in terms of skilled labour and we had capacity constraints in terms of fixed capital and that impacted on our productivity; that is, we had the demand but we just did not have the people and the input to be able to make materials into a product that we could sell and market. So we need to have a highly mobile, agile and well-trained workforce in order to be able to meet that need and to grow markets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094996"></A>
It is the case that the existence of up to eight different occupational licensing regimes for some professions across Australia undermines the goal of mobility and adds to red tape and costs. In his report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Rethinking regulation: report of the taskforce on reducing regulatory burdens on business,</Hansard-Italic>
 the task force chairman, Gary Banks, who himself is obviously a fairly productive fellow, made the following observation--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1094999"></A>
Not only do different jurisdictions require different levels and types of competency and related training to be undertaken to obtain a specific occupational licence, but coverage of the licences may also differ across jurisdictions. There may also be different entry requirements in terms of individual experience, character tests and background checks. The real estate sector is an example, with eight different eligibility regimes for obtaining a real estate agent licence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095000"></A>
That regulation task force estimated that red tape could be adding up to $8 billion per annum to the costs of doing business and the removal of those regulations could add up to $12 billion to gross domestic product. That 2006 report, along with a number of other reports and reviews over a number of years, prompted COAG into pursuing wide-ranging regulatory reform to achieve a seamless national economy. That then led to the national partnership agreement, which I have referred to, which was signed as part of COAG’s reform agenda to deliver more consistent regulation across jurisdictions to address unnecessary or poorly designed regulation, to reduce excessive compliance costs on business, restrictions on competition and distortions in the allocation of resources in the economy. By being a signatory to the seamless national economy agreement Queensland committed to continuing to reduce the level of unnecessary regulation and inconsistent regulation across jurisdictions, delivering agreed COAG deregulation and competition priorities--and there are 27 of those--and improving processes for regulation making and review. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095001"></A>
Following on from the seamless national economy agreement was the 2009 intergovernmental agreement for a licensing system for specified occupations, to which Queensland also signed up. That agreement is to set up a national licensing scheme for selected occupations as one of 27 separate reforms identified to improve productivity in the national economy. As I said earlier, it is a complex and time-consuming process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095002"></A>
I turn to the details of the bill and the national law. The bill adopts the occupational licensing national law, which is set out in the schedule to the Occupational Licensing National Law Act 2010 of Victoria, and it adopts that law as the law of Queensland. So rather than having our own legislation that incorporates it all--effectively mirror legislation--we are setting out a skeleton, or a framework, or the architecture of the legislation and we are importing as a schedule and applying it as a law the legislation that applies in Victoria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100396"></A>
The law gives effect to the governmental agreement for a national licensing system as signed in that COAG agreement in 2009. The COAG agreement sets out the framework for the national licensing scheme. It is important to note that this is cooperative national legislation and not a referral of powers to the Commonwealth. It is not the federal government that is setting the agenda here; the federal government and the states together are driving an agenda and using a cooperative scheme that is, I guess, a method of creating uniformity that has been around for a long time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100397"></A>
Occupational licensing has been done by the states on an historic basis resulting in, as I have said, a whole range of different processes, standards and policy settings across jurisdictions. While some attempts have been made to address those issues through mutual recognition agreements--that is, one state recognising the qualifications of another--those mutual recognition agreements still contain problems for licensees who want to move among the states. My colleague the member for Currumbin will detail some of the issues that particularly face people and businesses in her part of the state where she sits on the border and where there is a great deal of interaction between New South Wales and Queensland, although it does affect us all these days. If one goes to the Brisbane Airport one can catch a plane straight out of Brisbane to Karratha to work on the gas projects in Western Australia and, equally, people can come here or move interstate. People fly out from all over the country to work on the big resource projects. Mutual recognition did not solve those problems and provides increased cost burdens on individuals and increased cost burdens on the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100398"></A>
People are still required to apply for a state based licence. They may be required to meet different non-skills requirements and may have to pay multiple licence fees. Ultimately, those are paid for by the consumer. The policy objectives of this bill are to improve business efficiency, reduce red tape, improve mobility and enhance productivity by removing overlapping and inconsistent regulation between Queensland and other jurisdictions. It will achieve national consistency in licensing policy and the approach to disciplinary arrangements so that if someone does do the wrong thing everyone is satisfied that they will be disciplined in the appropriate fashion. It will promote consumer confidence and protection for consumers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100399"></A>
The law that this bill adopts sets out the framework for the national licensing system. The fairly large document that is appended as a schedule to the act contains the framework for the system including licensing eligibility requirements, disciplinary arrangements, monitoring and licence policy enforcement powers, financial and disciplinary arrangements and appeal rights and other governing arrangements. We did ask about this in the briefing and I am pleased to see that the penalties and disciplinary arrangements for people doing the wrong thing are, for the most part, as tough as those that presently exist in Queensland for the occupations that are being regulated under this scheme from 1 July 2012. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100400"></A>
The bill adopts a regulatory framework and a set of comprehensive general licensing requirements and it will also set up a national register to enable verification. There will be one central register to deal with the registration of these professions. It establishes a National Occupational Licensing Authority and occupational licensing advisory committees as well as a board. The ministerial council comprises Commonwealth, state and territory ministers and will be responsible for the implementation and operation of the national licensing system. The National Occupational Licensing Authority--no doubt it will be called NOLA before too much longer--will be established on 1 January 2011 and will be governed by a board appointed by the ministerial council. So the authority is set up, the people to run the authority are a board and they have to appoint a CEO. The National Occupational Licensing Authority will be responsible for administering the licensing system and developing policy for approval by the ministerial council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100401"></A>
For each occupation covered by the scheme, an occupational licensing advisory committee can be created to provide advice on licensing policy to the authority. Members of the occupational licensing advisory committees are to be appointed by the licensing authority board after inviting nominations from national peak bodies, but if there are no national peak bodies then other peak bodies, which would obviously be state peak bodies. The board of the National Occupational Licensing Authority will comprise 10 members or less and the board must have a chair who is not a licensee or involved in a licensed occupation. There must also be two jurisdictional regulator members who are appointed across from the jurisdictions involved and they are appointed for two-year terms. The national law does not specify who the other seven members of the board must be except to say that they must be persons with skills or experience in unions, employer representation, consumer advocacy or training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100402"></A>
The scheme will operate under a delegated agency model. This model involves the body responsible for policy for each occupational area, whilst overseeing its consistent application remains the responsibility of existing jurisdictional regulators. In Queensland electrical workers are licensed by the Department of Justice and Attorney-General, builders by the Building Services Authority and plumbers and gasfitters by the Building Services Authority as well as the Department of Mines and Energy and the Plumbing Industry Council. Property related professions in Queensland have their licenses issued and managed by the Office of Fair Trading, maritime occupations by Maritime Safety Queensland and transport related occupations by the Department of Transport and Main Roads. Are members not glad we are getting some simplification? Under this bill, these Queensland regulators will continue to perform their function but under the guidance of the national licensing system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100403"></A>
Stakeholders I have spoken to are strongly supportive of the concept of uniform national occupational licensing that will, for the first time, allow licensees to move across Australia under one consistent set of rules without the burden of applying for multiple licences. The benefits of uniformity are obvious as it is very easy to identify the additional costs and red tape that businesses and licensees who operate in and outside of Queensland face--that is, if a person wants to work in Victoria they will not have to apply and go through the time delays. For these reasons, and I have outlined our support for micro-economic reform, the LNP will support the bill. However, we will be watching very closely how the scheme operates in practice and particularly as so much of the scheme as it will operate will be left to regulations that are still to come and that we have not yet seen. Although I do note that according to the time frame set out in the intergovernmental agreement for the national licensing system those regulations should be complete by November 2010, the RIS should be approved by the ministerial council and provided to the Office of Best Practice Regulation and we should commence public consultation. For those people still involved in drafting those regulations, their time frame is rapidly approaching in order to comply with the time frame set out in the agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100404"></A>
A concern that the LNP has is with how the National Occupational Licensing Authority will operate in practice. It is quite telling that the Treasurer devoted three paragraphs in his second reading speech to the importance of union representation on the board of the licensing authority but did not once mention the importance of having business representation. The LNP believes there needs to be a balance on the board and that it must not be stacked with union members or Labor Party hacks. Another concern the LNP has is that because the benefits of uniformity are quite immediate and identifiable they can easily be overstated relative to the cost of poor and/or excessive regulation. So just because they are uniform regulations and they apply across the board does not necessarily mean that they are good regulations. They still have a plethora of other tests to go through in order to make sure that they do achieve the aim of making regulations less of a burden on business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100405"></A>
There is a risk that the regulations that eventually get drawn up under this scheme will turn out to be so excessive or poor in their design that they could impose costs on Queensland businesses in excess of the benefits that are hoped to be delivered through uniformity. As one goes through some of the material in relation to regulatory reform what one does find, and what the Productivity Commission found time and time and time again, is a failure on the part of governments to assess the regulations, to actually look at them and ask, ‘Are they achieving what they are put in place for?’ whether that be consumer safety, environmental safety or occupational health and safety, and whether that was being done in the most cost-effective way possible. A constant theme was the failure to actually measure the effect of the regulatory regime in all sorts of areas. Just because it is uniform does not mean it is good. We need to make sure that we monitor those regulations to make sure that they do achieve their aim. While we support the bill and will be voting for the bill, we will be watching very closely the development of the regulations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111083"></A>
Another concern that we have is that there does not appear to have been a thorough assessment by COAG or others of both the benefits and the costs of pursuing uniformity in occupational licensing. The benefits are, as I said, easy to identify. Pursuing uniformity does remove the potential benefits of competitive federalism. When each state and territory has its own occupational licensing scheme for those that do move to innovate or want to innovate, it may be more likely to happen when they have the capacity to do it. When each state and territory has its own licensing system, it is potentially able to act more quickly to implement good regulations and remove bad ones. This last point is very important: without jurisdictional competition, governments are able to maintain bad regulations indefinitely with weak or little pressure for change. I am not saying that the benefits of competitive federalism outweigh the benefits of uniformity but simply expressing some disappointment that this issue appears to not have been given due consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111086"></A>
There are also issues arising from the intergovernmental agreement that I would like to put to the Treasurer. As these are not detailed in the bill--the bill is only a framework--this is really the only opportunity I have to raise those issues, and I would like to point them out to him. They go to the Intergovernmental Agreement for a National Licensing System for Specified Occupations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111088"></A>
Clause 3.7 of the IGA, as I will call it, provides that the national licensing system will not compromise Queensland’s existing Home Warranty Insurance Scheme. That is the scheme operated under the auspices of the Building Services Authority. The bill itself does not address this issue, and I have not been able to see an exclusion in the law itself--that is, the schedule. I ask the Treasurer to confirm that this aspect has been covered and that the operation of the BSA legislation will still be there in terms of the Home Warranty Insurance Scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111089"></A>
I also raise the issue of whether the operation of the Building Services Authority legislation in effect will still have a restrictive effect on the mobility of licensees. That is, people who move here to Queensland to work will still have to have the necessary registration and consumer protections under the BSA. So they still have to comply with the BSA. Does that really free up the mobility of people wanting to operate in Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111090"></A>
Clause 4.3 deals with training and skills. This is an issue that we want to deal with. It refers to input into training packages. The clause says that, for the purposes of the agreement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111091"></A>
... the national licensing system will facilitate a consistent skill base for licensed occupational areas by:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1111092"></A>
a.	Providing input into Training Package development and review processes on the skill and education eligibility requirements of occupational licences; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1111093"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1111094"></A>
c.	In cases where there are both VET and higher education pathways, using the Training Package qualifications/skill sets that meet the skill and education eligibility requirements of occupational licences as the benchmark for the skill standards to be achieved by other learning pathways ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111095"></A>
My question in relation to that clause is: what action is being taken to ensure training and skills are being developed to meet these licensing requirements of the national scheme? Does Queensland have in place the requisite training regimes? Are our current training regimes adequate to meet those training and skills requirements?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111096"></A>
Clause 5.5 deals with changes to the scheme occupations and refers to ‘consensus’. ‘Consensus’ is defined as 100 per cent agreement. A number of other areas of the agreement refer to consensus. If we refer to section 103 of the law itself, the members of the Occupational Licensing Board are appointed by the ministerial council. So the law that is going to be the law of Queensland says that the appointees to the board are to be appointed by the ministerial council. But the rules for the ministerial council do not refer to how the council is to appoint the board members. Is it to be a majority? Is it to be a consensus? What are the rules? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111097"></A>
One of the issues that is raised consistently with uniform legislation like this is the ceding of this parliament’s power to an agreement entered into by executive government because it is not anywhere in the statute books that anyone would be able to look at. If you went to the Queensland statutes you would find the bill. You might, if you are lucky, find the schedule to it that was tabled by the Treasurer. But you certainly would not find the intergovernmental agreement that was signed by all the parties of executive government back in 2009. So here we have a process designed to set in place a board on a very important body to deal with occupational licences, the details of which are not available to anyone who might want to look at them or find them in any sensible or short fashion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111098"></A>
So is it the case that the intergovernmental agreement then operates to provide for consensus to appoint people to the board? The question to the Treasurer is: how much control is ceded as a result of this consensus requirement? Is it the case that the Treasurer’s stated intention in his second reading speech not to support a board that does not include a union representative is, in effect, a veto? He can control who is on that board by not voting for it because of the requirement for consensus set out in the intergovernmental agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111100"></A>
I am concerned at the amount of power being delegated by this House under the law--in particular, section 160 dealing with the regulations to be promulgated under the law. Those regulations are of critical importance, as I have outlined. I draw the attention of the House to subsection (2) for the full scope of the regulations. I also refer to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report No. 13 of 2010 and its comments, particularly about the parliamentary scrutiny of delegated power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111101"></A>
Section 164 of the law purports to deal with disallowance of regulations but at subsection (4) says that, even if a regulation is disallowed, it does not cease to have effect unless the regulation is disallowed in a majority of jurisdictions. Subsection (3) says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111103"></A>
A regulation made under this Law may be disallowed in a participating jurisdiction by a House of the Parliament of that jurisdiction in the same way, and within the same period, that a regulation made under an Act of that jurisdiction may be disallowed. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1111104"></A>
So the normal processes for disallowance are to be followed. Subsection (4) then says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111105"></A>
A regulation disallowed under subsection (3)--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1111106"></A>
so we have gone through the process: we have come in here, we have had the debate, the parliament has agreed to disallow the regulation and hopefully there is a good reason for it to be disallowed--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111107"></A>
does not cease to have effect in the participating jurisdiction, or any other participating jurisdiction, unless the regulation is disallowed in a majority of the participating jurisdictions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111108"></A>
So it is a case of--not quite but almost--one in, all in. The effect of being able to have a disallowance motion in relation to the regulation under this bill seems to be illusory. It is, in effect, a Clayton’s process that is provided for. Although this type of clause may be supported by the rationale of national scheme legislation, it is yet another derogation of this House’s authority. I think it is interesting to note that in Western Australia they are not adopting this framework. They are in fact passing an entire bill rather than just a framework and the adoption of a schedule to a bill to incorporate the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111109"></A>
I think concerns have also been raised in the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report in relation to some of the powers that can be exercised without reference to this parliament. I think concerns have been raised in the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report in relation to the impact of some of the checks and charges. One I would like to identify is the criminal history check--the fact that someone who has been charged is to be included in the information to be provided when assessing whether someone is of a suitable character to be carrying out the occupation. I think it is a pretty long bow to draw for a charge against someone to be included in the consideration of whether they are a suitable person to carry out that occupation--a charge unproven and untested. Who knows whether it was true or false? For that information to be used in that way to assess whether someone ought to be given a licence to operate as an electrician or as a plumber or as an air-conditioning maintenance person seems to me to be a very extreme example of the lengths that the licensing authority will be going to in order to satisfy themselves that someone ought to be carrying out that job. </Hansard-Body>

Even after the national scheme is fully operational, there will still be work to be done in reducing red tape and costs when it comes to occupational licensing. It is still not clear at this stage how the scheme will treat contractor licensing. If contractor licensing is not covered by the national scheme, this means that--although, for example, a Queensland plumber who also operates in New South Wales may only be required to apply for and obtain one plumbing licence once the national licensing scheme is fully operational--they may still be required to apply for a contracting licence in both states. That is under the BSA type of scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111148"></A>
A second issue this scheme does not address is some of the hoops that businesses and individuals must jump through even when they operate solely within Queensland. Take the example of a Queensland plumber and gasfitter. Firstly, they must deal with the Plumbing Industry Council and the Department of Mines and Energy to obtain an occupational licence, but then they also need to go to the Building Services Authority to obtain their contractor licence. As the new licensing scheme will operate under a delegated agency model, it does not necessarily address any of the inefficiencies of having to deal with multiple regulatory agencies within the same jurisdiction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111150"></A>
A number of issues still need to be dealt with. This is the first step in addressing some of these issues. I note there is a time frame attached to the intergovernmental agreement, and compliance with that time frame is also necessary in order for us to be able to get incentive payments and facilitation payments totalling some $90 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111153"></A>
There will be some revenue implications. The Treasurer came into the House just after lunch to introduce a message from the Governor. I presume that is to do with the fact that the fees and charges that are to be dealt with, and which are covered for in the bill rather than in the act itself, will need to be remitted somewhere. I would ask for clarification on that as well. It is obvious that the appropriation of the fees collected will have to either go to a central authority or be used in a way that is different from that which is currently contemplated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111154"></A>
Micro-economic reform is vital. As I said, there has been a broad reform consensus for the best part of 30 years in relation to the need for it and the need to increase productivity. This is another step along the way. I have to say it is a very tortuous step. The complexity of it is well understood and we do hope this bill achieves the reforms it has set out to achieve. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (5.30 pm): I rise to speak in the debate on the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill 2010, which was introduced into the House on 6 October by the honourable the Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development. The purpose of this bill is to apply the occupational licensing national law set out in the schedule to the Occupational Licensing National Law Act 2010 of Victoria--known as the law--as a law of Queensland. The law is the legislative framework for a national occupational licensing system, the NLS. As honourable members have heard from my learned colleague the shadow Treasurer and honourable member for Clayfield in his well-researched speech, the LNP is supporting this bill but he highlighted our reservations about the future implementation and also the need for a regulation review. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111157"></A>
States and territories have historically been charged with developing their own licensing systems, with variations and irregularities causing frustration and duplication between jurisdictions. At present, mutual recognition allows licensees who wish to move between states to apply to be registered in a second jurisdiction without further assessment of their skills. Despite this, a number of impositions still exist, including meeting different non-skills requirements, additional fees and application processes. This is particularly onerous for workers in cross-border areas, such as my own electorate of Currumbin, which straddles the state boundary with New South Wales. Recognising these difficulties, the Council of Australian Governments--COAG--entered into the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy in July 2008 and as such developed the NLS to remove inconsistencies across jurisdictional borders and allow for a more mobile workforce.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111160"></A>
Essentially, the national licensing scheme will allow for current holders of state and territory licences to be automatically recognised under the new licence system and a public national register of licensees to be established. It was agreed that the Commonwealth has no legislative role in the establishment of the new system. Subsequently, in April 2009, COAG agreed to the intergovernmental agreement for a national licensing system for specified occupations--known as the COAG agreement--to establish a licensing body to develop policy and administer the NLS. Under this COAG agreement, the NLS will initially apply to seven occupational areas. These are air conditioning and refrigeration, electrical, plumbing and gasfitting, property related occupations, building and building related occupations, land transport, and maritime.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111161"></A>
The law has been designed to allow for additional occupations to be added over time. This would require amendments to legislation as this transpires. Phase 1 is expected to commence from 1 July 2012 and will cover the first occupations I just listed. Prior to implementation, each state will be required to enact amendments to its jurisdictional legislation applying to the relevant occupational areas to allow the facilitation of the national law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111162"></A>
Living in and representing the southern most coastal cross-border electorate in Queensland, I can attest to the fact that the provisions of this bill are very pertinent to the constituents of Currumbin. Indeed, the topic of licensing is also particularly relevant to my role as shadow minister for public works and ICT, a portfolio with responsibility for a range of licensing concerns for various industries across this great state. Currently, differences in licensing requirements between states--including classification, eligibility, duration and fee structures--can cause prohibitive costs to individuals and businesses, wasting both time and money. A nationally consistent framework is welcomed to iron out these inconsistencies and promote greater business activity among states, particularly in cross-border areas. Creation of a truly seamless community between Queensland and New South Wales becomes a step closer to reality with the passage of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111167"></A>
Tom Senti, from the Tweed Economic Development Corporation, informed me of the following statistics: the Tweed--my geographic neighbour--currently has one of the lowest work participation rates in Australia at 42 per cent; New South Wales, in which it sits, has a work population rate of 62 per cent; Queensland sits at 62.3 per cent; and Australia generally sits at 65 per cent. This equates to some 32,000 people in the Tweed--self-employed and employees as full-time equivalents--earning an income and living in the Tweed. However, the point here is that more than 12,000 of these 32,000 leave the Tweed on a daily basis to work in other places, mostly in South-East Queensland, which clearly demonstrates once again the interconnectivity of the two cross-border economies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111170"></A>
Other research by TEDC over the last 10 years--including the joint Gold Coast City Council and TEDC Seamless Borders Project and the Tweed and Gold Coast Aviation Transport Hub Project--confirms that the two economies of South-East Queensland and the Tweed are inextricably linked and to a very large extent are interdependent. The Tweed as a population-driven growth area and the occupational areas listed under the COAG agreement are all part of the services and trades sector which cross the border on a daily basis. As such, the issue of compliance is seen as a major impediment to the growth of both regional economies. Recognition of interstate licences can only assist employment, generating growth of both economies. I thank Tom Senti for this information and wish him a speedy recovery from his recent operation. It would, however, be remiss of me not to mention the impact of dual time zones, which places further imposts on the daily activities of a large number of people who live, work and play in our region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111174"></A>
Robert Wright, a local builder who works the border region, is favourable to reform but says it needs to go further. This builder is of the opinion that there is a need for uniform regulations across the nation: ‘After all,’ he says, ‘we are one country.’ Borders are not physical, touchable structures in our modern world and mean nothing to the people conducting business day to day, except for varying standards and regulations which impede and complicate business transactions. In terms of industry standards, Robert questioned whether there should be building to one standard throughout Australia. Different workplace health and safety standards exist between the states. Essentially they are the same but with small variations, and it is frustrating, not to mention time consuming, getting certificates for both Queensland and New South Wales.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111177"></A>
Robert said that news that a national standard for workplace health and safety is also going to be implemented in the next couple of years is welcome. However, reapplying for the national certificate will also be a time-consuming exercise. This is the kind of superfluous and repetitive red tape that hits small businesses the hardest. The shadow Treasurer made a comment about the form these qualifications will take, with concerns that as standards elsewhere vary it may open the door for standards to drop. Many tradespeople may qualify with lower standards and skills, and that would be to the detriment of the consumer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111180"></A>
I consulted with the Master Builders Association here in Queensland, which supports a comprehensive licensing system that is focused on the protection of consumers. It believes that protecting the interests of consumers is best achieved by, firstly, maintaining and improving building standards by ensuring that accredited training is a condition of licensing and, secondly, ensuring the financial viability of building contractors by requiring all contractors to meet regular and ongoing financial tests as a condition of licensing. These objectives, they say, will be achieved--or not--through the regulations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116838"></A>
The national licensing scheme is anticipated to function under a delegated agency model, meaning that the licensing authority created by this law will delegate its regulatory licensing functions to existing regulatory authorities. Notably, the law does not permit the delegation of the licensing authority’s function for policy development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116839"></A>
According to the Treasurer’s second reading speech, this legislation will not involve a referral of powers to the Commonwealth government. This bill, however, is designed as skeletal legislation, creating a legislative superstructure and leaving significant elements of the licensing system to be dealt with by regulations that are still to come. Honourable members have heard the concerns of the shadow Treasurer in relation to these coming regulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116840"></A>
As the regulations associated with the first phase of this bill will not be enacted until 2012, what we have before us will need to be the subject of further legislation before it is fully implemented. Interim advisory committees--IACs--are to be established for each first-phase occupation to provide advice on licensing policy for the development of national regulations. The IACs will consist of union, employer, regulator and consumer representatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116841"></A>
The cost to the Queensland government as a result of this legislation will be twofold. Direct funding to the tune of $1.4 million between 2009 and 2011 has been contributed to the establishment of the licensing authority. Additionally, there will be an indirect financial consequence to the state in the form of lost revenue from interstate licence fees as the requirement to obtain multiple licences across jurisdictions is being eradicated by the national scheme. It would be interesting to learn just how much revenue is estimated to be lost once this legislation is implemented. I would ask the Treasurer if he has those figures to share them with the House in his reply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116843"></A>
I would like to raise a couple of other issues arising from the provisions in the bill. Collection of criminal history information presents some privacy issues, and the collection and publication of personal information also raises concerns. In its submission to the Victorian government on the initial national law bill, the Office of the Victorian Privacy Commissioner highlighted the lack of voluntary participation in the scheme, cemented by the penalties relating to the offence of not being licensed and the mandatory disclosure of personal information of licensees raising significant privacy challenges. The Deputy Privacy Commissioner had this to say on the topic of national registers--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1116846"></A>
The proposed national registers will collectively contain thousands of records relating to licensees. All matters in relation to how information on the registers will be collected, recorded and kept and inspection, access and publication of public registers has been left to national regulation. This means it is currently not possible to analyse the privacy implications of the national register, and protection will be dependent on the Ministerial Council. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116847"></A>
Not surprisingly, the LNP also shares this sentiment. An absence of analysis of the benefits that this scheme may bring to national and state economies raises a certain degree of uncertainty as to whether this scheme really will achieve positive results in the long term. It is to be hoped that it will. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116848"></A>
Also of concern is the limited parliamentary oversight involved with this national scheme. National regulations, on which the majority of this scheme will be reliant, are to be made by the ministerial council, at this stage being the Ministerial Council for Federal Financial Relations. The process by which regulations are proposed to be made appears to bypass significant parliamentary scrutiny. To ensure legislative consistency, any disallowance of a regulation by a jurisdiction can only be approved if the majority of participating jurisdictions have disallowed the regulation. Further concerns about abrogating the rights of parliaments will undoubtedly arise once the system begins. I note at this point that Western Australia is the only state that has indicated that it will not enact the national legislation. However, WA has indicated that it will draft legislation that mirrors the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116850"></A>
Under the new national law, an individual carrying out work without a licence or relevant exemption will face a $50,000 fine for a first or second offence or $50,000, 12 months imprisonment or both for a third or subsequent offence. Advertising to perform work without a licence or exemption will incur the same penalty, as will the offence of holding out an unlicensed person as being licensed or a licensee allowing the use of their licence by another person. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116851"></A>
The provision of harsh penalties is particularly important when considering the nature of the specified occupations. For example, electrical and building work that is repeatedly carried out by an unlicensed individual can produce a serious and even deadly risk to public safety. Penalties for offences prescribed by this bill are harsher than some existing penalties. Under section 42 of the Queensland Building Services Authority Act 1991, unlicensed contracting currently attracts a maximum fine of $25,000, or 250 penalty units. Doubling of penalties is certainly an effective means of stamping out the frequency of illegal business practices. However, there are concerns as to how this new national law will be able to monitor industry to detect these offences when our state based agencies, which were supposedly designed to perform this function, are failing to do so. That is, of course, unless dishonest and unprincipled practices or bad press puts pressure on this government to take action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116853"></A>
A number of the occupations encapsulated in this bill fall under the jurisdiction of the QBSA. At present, this statutory body is undergoing a review being conducted for the government by KPMG. The LNP has put out a discussion paper that encourages industry stakeholders and consumers to have their say about aspects of the BSA that work well and also those that they think require improvement or change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116855"></A>
The shadow Treasurer highlighted the need for a regulation review. In some ways, it could be said that the QBSA is a good example. A recent CMC report identified a raft of serious flaws with organisational and governance structures and made seven recommendations. Inadequate policies and lack of guidance led to oversight of serious breaches of the law and eroded the confidence of affected consumers in the BSA’s ability to protect them. The CMC report into the Queensland BSA is largely an attempt to defend the current organisation by asserting that past problems have been fixed. Looking at the report in terms of governance, it is clear that the major problem was the failure of management to accept the responsibilities of their position. That situation is whitewashed in the report with its bureaucratic reference to all of the new practices that now are claimed to be in operation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116856"></A>
Management is required to manage and is expected to ensure that operational staff are trained, monitored and supervised on a continuous basis. The report confirms that management failed in all of these responsibilities. Neither they nor their staff were properly qualified in the accountancy skills required to deal with the analysis of builders’ financial status. The excuse given was that the salary classification for staff doing this work was too low to attract trained accountancy staff but that the GFC had made the position more attractive to accountants from the private sector. One would hope that any future regulations would not bow to this excuse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116857"></A>
We have been told that this is skeletal legislation and that the regulations are to follow. The episode under discussion relating to this CMC report reveals that the finance division was simply overloaded with unresolved cases and an inability to attract senior officers because it was not equipped to handle the job. So too many cases of financial uncertainty were allowed to go unresolved, leading to more and more complaints. Whether these recommendations have resolved the concerns remains a mystery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116858"></A>
Cases of licence lending in the building industry have left Queenslanders facing a significant financial burden. I was contacted recently by an individual who had seen the devastating effects that the inadequate policing of this practice has had on the public purse. Indeed, it is the QBSA that is left to foot the bill of outstanding payments to debtors when a building company goes into liquidation because of poor workmanship. It is the responsibility of the nominee of the company, being a licence holder, to ensure adequate supervision of work done under the name of the company. This individual put it down to a lack of monitoring controls by state and local governments that led to such practices occurring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116859"></A>
In closing, a national licensing system for specified occupations under the COAG agreement will enable the facilitation of workplace flexibility that has been denied to interstate workers until now. From stakeholder comments, there will undoubtedly be a lot of angst as the regulations are developed. This will involve industry, unions and regulators from across the country, each with a different view. Hopefully, the benefits from this uniformity will outweigh any anticipated problems. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Keppel--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.49 pm): In speaking to the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill, I think it is painfully evident to everyone that the only way that industry operations can be undertaken is under a national scheme. COAG has actually achieved that in a number of other areas. We have had a recent referral of our registers to a national scheme. We started out by having a mutual recognition act. Although it allowed people to be acknowledged in separate jurisdictions within the same area of law, it was quite apparent that it did not work properly. Each state still continued to operate its own system of laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116898"></A>
This national law agreed by COAG is designed to cover five key areas, those being: licensing, disciplinary proceedings and actions, monitoring and enforcement, reviews, and appeals. I have made the comment in this House before that it really pleases me that we are not giving away the powers of the state. This is a cooperative scheme. In actual fact, it is not a referral of powers. The states will still retain their power to deal with the regulation. In a lot of cases there are different aspects and different needs, albeit rather small. Each state has slight variations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116899"></A>
The method by which this was to be achieved was that Victoria would pass the first stage in the process which set out the national law. The second stage is that each participating jurisdiction would introduce legislation that applies that law. It is interesting that Western Australia has chosen to enact its own legislation. It says that it will achieve the same result. Western Australia did the same thing with the family law act and there were some substantial differences in approach in the Western Australian family court. Hopefully, it will achieve the same result, but only time will tell. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116900"></A>
I endorse some of the comments made by the shadow Treasurer in relation to this method of regulation, but I am afraid I cannot agree with him as to the outcome of deregulation or simplified regulation of our financial system. Perhaps he could have a look at the date 12 December 1983 when gentlemen named Paul Keating and Bob Hawke floated the Australian dollar. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1254060"></A>
The actual national licensing system was, as we have heard, to apply to seven broad occupational areas. There are four in the first phase. They are air conditioning, and refrigeration, plumbing and gasfitting, electrical, and property related occupations. The second phase is building and building related occupations, maritime and land transport--passenger vehicle drivers and dangerous goods only. That second phase is to look at regulation as soon as possible after 2013. Hopefully, that will not be affected by the current make-up of the federal government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116905"></A>
I was very pleased to see one thing in relation to the advisory committee and the appointments and that is that the Treasurer remains in strong support of union representation on that advisory committee. I think that blind Freddy could see that where we are dealing with the operation of trades it is very often the union representative or union perspective which really supports the way those trades operate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116906"></A>
The key objectives of this law were set out by the COAG agreement. The key objectives are: licensees would be able to operate in all jurisdictions, there would be consistent skill and knowledge for those occupations, there would be effective coordination between the licensing authority and jurisdictional regulators, and there would be national consistency in licensing structures and policy across comparable occupations. I do not think that anyone in this House--and I note that the LNP is supporting this bill--could argue that seamless business operation can occur throughout Australia even though each state and the territories retain their ability to regulate operations according to the needs of their own jurisdiction. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (5.55 pm): I rise to speak to the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill 2010. In doing so, I acknowledge that more and more of these kinds of professions are transportable and very mobile. In my electorate we currently are, and will be in the future, looking more and more for some of these tradespeople. The ability to recruit locally first and then within the state and interstate is very important in meeting skill demands. The nationalisation of these sorts of skills, the registration of these skills, the hearing of any breaches of these skills and the hearing of disciplinary matters will--theoretically at least--be effective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116909"></A>
I only have a couple of questions that I would like cleared up. In terms of the trades affected, will people be properly informed of the changes and not just their overarching bodies--that is, the plumbers association, air conditioners association or the gasfitting association? Will the government, which has records of all of the people with these licences, contact them and let them know what the changes are and how they will affect them in terms of process? Will the information get to those who hold these qualifications?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116911"></A>
Given that previous speakers have said that the state administrative structure will remain but there will be an overarching structure, will it incur greater costs to those holding these licences or will it be cost effective? I am sure many of those holding these transportable qualifications will be pleased to be able to move interstate where necessary to do work but they would have concerns if there were significant additional costs involved in getting their licences. They are the main things that I wanted to have clarified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116913"></A>
I have heard that this is a skeleton bill, an act that will be built on as time progresses given that the first rollout will not happen until 2012. I do think it is critically important that those affected know in detail how it will affect them and what the new process will be so that none are caught at the time of their renewal not knowing the process that is required. They also need to know upfront what costs are going to be incurred by them--because they will have to pay them--and whether that cost is going to be significantly greater or more acceptably less than what they are currently paying. I look forward to the response. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (6.00 pm): I am pleased to rise in support of the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill which will establish an important milestone in COAG’s determination to harmonise specified occupational licensing across the nation. The bill before the House has its genesis in COAG’s 2008 commitment to the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy. The COAG reform agenda outlined under this agreement intends to deliver a more consistent and better designed regulatory platform across jurisdictions in this nation. There is no doubt that a successfully implemented national partnership agreement will deliver a reduction in red tape and compliance costs and a less restrictive business environment. Not all of the agenda will be easy as the states and Commonwealth vie to retain long-held systems and reporting regimes. I do not expect that harmonising occupational licensing regulations will be any different, but that does not make it a worthy goal. In many ways the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy was a cornerstone of the Rudd government that will continue to reap benefits for many years to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122634"></A>
This bill has a specific purpose, and that is to apply the occupational licensing national law set out in the schedule to the Occupational Licensing National Law Act 2010 of Victoria as a law of Queensland. In other words, the Victorian government has enacted the template framework that other jurisdictions must adopt to allow the reform to move forward. It is important to note that the measures in the bill before us today are just the beginning of this particular reform agenda. There remains a large body of work yet to be done. This includes national regulations and amendments to jurisdictional legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122637"></A>
The COAG National Licensing Task Force is in the process of developing the national regulations. These regulations will include eligibility which will cover qualifications, skills and knowledge; scope of work for each category of licence; general regulations, which will include matters such as criminal history requirements; and transitional regulations. The national regulations will also be subjected to the Commonwealth regulation impact statement process, which will involve public consultation. In addition, the national regulations will need to be approved by the ministerial council and, importantly, unanimous agreement to the national regulations will be required.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122638"></A>
This process will undoubtedly take some time to complete. It will take considerable time to obtain agreement from all jurisdictions. Also, once the national regulations are developed, jurisdictions will need to pass consequential and transitional legislation to the relevant licensing statutes. This does not mean that we are at the very beginning of the process, however. In accordance with the COAG agreement, interim advisory committees comprising union, employer, regulator and consumer representatives have been established for each of the first phase occupational areas. The interim advisory committees are providing advice on licensing policy for specific occupational areas, and this will inform the regulations that will be made. Ultimately, an occupational licence advisory committee will be set up for each occupation in the national system. The members of these advisory committees will be appointed by the National Occupational Licensing Board and will include representatives from national peak bodies that represent that occupation. Meanwhile, Queensland has strong representation on the existing interim advisory committees which are to be replaced by the occupational licence advisory committees and there will be an opportunity for Queensland to maintain or increase this level of representation when nominations are sought.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122640"></A>
Once established, how will the national occupational licensing system benefit Queenslanders? At present each state or jurisdiction oversees its own set of regulations around occupational licensing and, just like the rail line gauges, each state has a unique set of eligibility criteria. That is fine if, say, as an electrician you only want to work in Queensland, but we know of course that these days many companies and individual tradespeople tender for work in multiple states and often on a national basis. I might say that the first phase of these reforms will focus on four specific occupational areas--air conditioning and refrigeration, electrical, plumbing and gasfitting, and property related occupations. It is not hard to think of instances where individuals or companies within these fields extend beyond state boundaries. Notwithstanding the existence of the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, which allows licence holders from one jurisdiction to apply to be registered in another, there remained disincentives for licensees to operate in a truly national context. With the assistance of the internet and other forms of ICT, it is not unusual for businesses and individuals to operate in multiple jurisdictions, so the end result of the reform that we will begin with this bill today will certainly provide a financial and operational boost for existing and future businesses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122646"></A>
Once the national licensing system is established, licence holders in relevant occupational areas will be licensed in all participating jurisdictions using the one licence for the occupation. It will no longer be necessary to hold a licence in each jurisdiction in which the licensee operates. Applicants and licensees will need to meet a nationally consistent set of licensing requirements. The only fees applicable will be those in the jurisdiction where the licence is granted. Therefore, there will be one application fee, one renewal fee et cetera for the one occupational licence. Licensees will be licensed in all participating jurisdictions without the burden of having to hold or apply for multiple licences. This will facilitate a much more mobile workforce, enabling licensees to move across Australia going where they are needed without the administrative burden of current structures.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122648"></A>
Licensees, businesses and consumers will also benefit from greater national consistency in licensing structures and policy, including standard qualification requirements. It is anticipated these changes will allow a business to become more efficient and competitive. There will also be benefits to consumers who will benefit through the establishment of a national register of all licensees. This will enable the public to verify that particular individuals or businesses are appropriately licensed for the work they are being asked to undertake. Given that this bill is an important step in the realisation of a national system for occupational licensing, I definitely commend it to this House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (6.06 pm): I rise to speak on the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill 2010. I would have taken that interjection from the member for Rockhampton, but I did not actually hear it so I cannot comment on it. It sort of bounced back. I say at the outset that I perhaps do not share the zeal of the member for Clayfield and indeed the member for Whitsunday for regulatory reform, but I thank the member for Clayfield for identifying a couple of books that I might read which I will look out for in the second-hand shops in Annerley so that I can perhaps embark on a new-found zeal for regulatory reform. But I do understand it is a very important matter before this House.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If you have a copy for me and if you would sign it for me, I would appreciate that. This bill forms part of a national scheme to implement new national occupational licensing. It is part of the national reform agenda and importantly does not involve referral of powers to the Commonwealth but is about a bill that will apply a national law as the law of Queensland. I want to make a few very brief comments on this bill. I recognise the efforts of COAG and the efforts of the states to develop a national licensing scheme that seeks to provide benefits across the country. Some of those benefits are business efficiencies, reductions in red tape and, importantly I think, skills mobility and the ability for workers who travel across the country to have a consistent licensing regime, and these are aspirational aspects of the national agenda that are worth supporting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122658"></A>
I do need to acknowledge that in my parliamentary secretary role I have had some involvement with the harmonisation and nationalisation process. Whilst there are good intentions with much of our harmonisation, we must all be working very hard in that process to ensure that we are delivering benefit for all. Harmonisation and nationalisation and schemes that deliver these things need to be providing benefit. Importantly, we have seen a bit of comment in the media about harmonisation and the often quoted phrase is that it needs to lift us up and not be a race to the bottom and that we need to be picking those things that provide the highest standards across the country and adopting them so that, whilst we get those efficiencies and we get those reductions of red tape, we do not get a reduction in standards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122697"></A>
In my experience of safety harmonisation, a lot of that challenge comes down to the states. You often experience a reluctance of some states to adopt a higher standard because of the costs or the issues involved for that state in adopting a new regime. The state that has the highest standard has concerns about losing some of the benefits of the standards that it has. So I think the challenge is for the states to ensure that, in the process of harmonisation and nationalisation, we come out with improved national laws to the benefit of all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122698"></A>
The main issue that I wanted to comment on was in relation to the make-up of the board that will advise the authority in relation to the national licensing scheme. There was a comment in the Treasurer’s speech about the representation on those boards. I have received a number of representations from members of trade unions, and in particular I acknowledge Allen Hicks and Keith McKenzie of the Electrical Trades Union who spoke to me about their issues in relation to this legislation. I have also met with departmental officers of the Electoral Safety Office in the portfolio that I work in who have been closely involved in this matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122703"></A>
The intent of national licensing and national regimes is to ensure boards have merit based appointments. There are some people who think there is a difference between a representative board and a merit based board. My view is that you can have representative boards and merit based boards. They should be the same thing. It is appropriate to find representation from industries and sectors that are relevant, and that should deliver merit as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122704"></A>
In the representations that I received from officials of the Electrical Trades Union, they talked to me about how licensing is their bread and butter, how licensing is intricately linked to safety in their workplace, how licensing is critical to skills development in their industry--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, just like plumbers as well. Licensing is fundamental to those aspects of their industry and it is important for them to have representation at board level. Similarly--and I note the comment of the member for Clayfield that boards should not be, I think his words were, full of unionists or ALP hacks--the advice that I received from the ETU was that they thought a representative board must include peak employer organisations in the industry as well, that there were benefits for the union in having those people on the board as well, and that they were not seeking for the board to be representative of a single sector of the industry. In any case, I was pleased to raise with the Treasurer the representative nature of the board. I welcome the Treasurer’s commitment, which is outlined clearly in his second reading speech, in terms of the position that he will take to COAG on this matter. Can I once again acknowledge the work of the departmental officers of the Electrical Safety Office for their role in the formulation of this legislation. I support the bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (6.12 pm): I rise to make a short contribution to the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill 2010. As outlined in the explanatory notes, the objective of this bill is to apply the occupational licensing national law set out in the schedule to the Occupational Licensing National Law Act 2010 of Victoria--the law--as a law of Queensland. The bill gives effect to a COAG agreement signed in April 2009 for the establishment of a national licensing system--the NLS--for specified occupations. The law is the legislative framework for a national occupational licensing system whose purpose is to remove overlapping and inconsistent regulation between jurisdictions for the licensing of the specified occupations and aims to improve business efficiency and the competitiveness of the national economy, reduce red tape, improve labour mobility and enhance productivity. It is hoped that the NLS will promote consumer confidence and protection without imposing unnecessary costs on consumers or substantially lessening competition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122710"></A>
As the licensing of occupational areas is predominately a state and territory function and is currently conducted by a range of regulatory bodies in each state and territory, in the past approaches to licensing have not been consistent. Currently, regulatory bodies have the responsibility for administering threshold licence entry criteria and ongoing conduct requirements for licensees. They monitor compliance and administer disciplinary procedures, maintain registers of licensees and oversee skills maintenance requirements, such as continuing professional development. Due to differing jurisdictional policies and practices, licences issued for the same occupational area by individual jurisdictions often have different parameters, eligibility requirements and permitted scopes of work. These include the costs of multiple licence fees and complying with multiple regulatory regimes. Both direct and indirect costs are particularly high for small to medium sized businesses where they constitute a significant proportion of total costs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122712"></A>
Under the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, individual occupational licence holders from one jurisdiction can apply to be registered in a second jurisdiction on the basis of their existing licence and without a further assessment of their skills. Regulators in a second jurisdiction have an obligation under mutual recognition requirements to issue an applicant with a licence to undertake activities that are substantially the same as those permitted under their licence in the first jurisdiction. This is not unlike the situation that existed for nurses whereby they had to be registered in each state to be able to practise. I am very pleased that the federal government and all the states have introduced legislation to make sure that nurses do not have to pay registration in multiple states, as I had to to practise in New South Wales and Queensland. This legislation is very similar.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122713"></A>
Regulators may use conditions on licences to achieve equivalence. Despite mutual recognition, while each state and territory maintains different licensing regimes, licensees who want to move between jurisdictions must still apply for a licence, meet different non-skills requirements and pay a separate licence fee for the equivalent licence in each jurisdiction in which they wish to work. These arrangements are particularly difficult for individuals and/or businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions and for those working in border areas, both of which must comply with different licensing and regulatory requirements. They are also a disincentive to pursuing work in other jurisdictions, particularly work of a shorter duration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122715"></A>
In this context, the Council of Australian Governments--COAG--entered into the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy--the NPA--on 3 July 2008. As part of that agreement, COAG agreed to develop an NLS that would remove inconsistencies across jurisdictional borders and allow for a more mobile workforce. On 30 April 2009, COAG agreed to the Intergovernmental Agreement for a National Licensing System for Specified Occupations. The NLS will initially be applied to seven of these occupations: air conditioning and refrigeration; electrical; plumbing and gasfitting; property related occupations; building and building related occupations; land transport, particularly passenger vehicle drivers and dangerous goods only; and maritime. The objective of the NLS is to improve business efficiency, reduce red tape, improve labour mobility and enhance productivity by removing overlapping and inconsistent regulation between jurisdictions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122718"></A>
The bill is designed to allow licensees to move across Australia without the burden of applying for additional licences and create national consistency in licensing policy and the approach to disciplinary arrangements whilst retaining some flexibility for issues specific to jurisdictions or occupations. It is also meant to promote consumer confidence and protection without unnecessary costs on consumers. I have a company in my electorate that is very keen to protect some of their issues, particularly in relation to an invention that they have for apex seals in a rotary piston engine, described as swinging slipper seals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122719"></A>
The Queensland bill has the effect of applying that occupational licensing law as set out in the schedule to the Occupational Licensing National Law Act 2010 of Victoria as a law of Queensland. Each other state and territory will introduce a similar bill before the end of the year. This is national legislation, not a referral of powers to the Commonwealth. The NLS is a component of COAG’s seamless national economy reforms. This bill is essentially skeletal legislation, as outlined by the shadow Treasurer, creating a legislative superstructure and some general licensing requirements with many of the significant elements of the NLS left to regulations that are still to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122720"></A>
All stakeholders contacted supported the concept of national licensing and acknowledge the benefits that a single national licence will bring. Stakeholders also support the delegated agency model and some specifically lobbied for the delegated agency model in their submissions to COAG. As I said, all stakeholders who were contacted supported the concept of this national licensing and acknowledged the benefits. The Liberal National Party will not be opposing this bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(6.18 pm): As we have heard this evening, the shadow Treasurer has a recommended reading list for bills such as this. So impressed was he by Gary Banks’s <Hansard-Italic>

, he shared it around the opposition members. Contrary to popular opinion, not only is it educational; it is actually incredibly easy to read and it does not put you to sleep.

As mentioned by others, the objectives of the NLS are to improve business efficiency across seven occupations, reduce red tape, improve labour mobility and enhance productivity by removing overlapping and inconsistent regulation between jurisdictions. The bill is designed to allow licensees to move across Australia without the burden of applying for additional licences, create national consistency in licensing policy and the approach to disciplinary arrangements whilst retaining some flexibility for issues specific to jurisdictions or occupations and promote consumer confidence and protection without unnecessary costs to consumers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128553"></A>
These benefits of the legislation are immediately clear and obvious. Uniformity will deliver efficiencies for business and licensees, but there is a bit of a wait and see approach to some elements of the legislation as highlighted by the shadow Treasurer in his contribution this evening. We are giving powers to a ministerial council that really is accountable to no-one. If Queensland desires to amend the laws at any time in the future we must basically go cap in hand seeking consensus from that ministerial council. But given that this legislation is skeletal and will be supported by regulation, perhaps more concerning is the potential, as mentioned by the member for Mudgeeraba, that that supporting regulation may become excessively large and/or inferior to existing Queensland regulations and therefore could negate the benefits of uniformity. </Hansard-Body>

It is worth acknowledging the comments of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in its most recent <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee does look at parliamentary scrutiny of delegated power, and whether a bill has sufficient regard to the institution of parliament depends on whether, for example, the bill sufficiently subjects the exercise of the delegated legislative power to the scrutiny of the Legislative Assembly. There has been growing concern within the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee around parliamentary scrutiny of national regulations. The <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1128556"></A>
In the past, the committee has expressed concern about nationally consistent regulation which failed to require the tabling in the Legislative Assembly of regulations made under a national law. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1128557"></A>
Fortunately, though, this piece of legislation is perhaps the first that we have seen as a committee come across our tables that addresses that particular concern. The committee goes on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1128558"></A>
Therefore, the committee is pleased to note that although clause 5 would exclude the operation of the <Hansard-Italic>
Statutory Instruments Act </Hansard-Italic>
generally, section 164(1) would require the tabling in the Legislative Assembly of national regulations. Section 164(1) requires the member of the Ministerial Council representing a participating jurisdiction to make arrangements for the tabling of a regulation made under the National Law in each House of the Parliament of the participating jurisdiction. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128559"></A>
It is worth pointing out, though, that perhaps we have really only taken half a step forward in this instance. As the shadow Treasurer pointed out in his comments, if we were to disallow a regulation related to this national legislation, it still needs to be disallowed in a majority of the other states for it to actually take effect in this state. In closing, I acknowledge the contribution of the shadow Treasurer and member for Clayfield and that the LNP will not be opposing this legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JOHNSTONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Townsville--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.23 pm): I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Occupational Licensing National Law (Queensland) Bill. The objective of the bill is to apply the Occupational Licensing National Law Act 2010, as passed in the Victorian parliament in September, as a law of Queensland. The national law is a schedule to that act and this bill applies the national law in Queensland. The national law, as has been said by previous speakers, is the legislative framework for the national occupational licensing system which aims to allow for more practical movement of people working in the occupations covered by this legislation across jurisdictions in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128562"></A>
Consumers will also benefit from these changes by having access to information about the licensees in a national register. The occupations that are covered by this bill were selected by COAG based on selection criteria, including the importance of the occupation to the economy and being subject to previous mutual recognition schemes. As has been stated, the national system will be implemented in two phases: phase 1 from 1 July 2012 and phase 2 from 1 July 2013. The national law will have built-in flexibility which will also allow for additional occupational areas to be added in future through nomination by participating jurisdictions and by agreement with the ministerial council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128563"></A>
History tells us that because licensing has traditionally been a state and territory function, licensing systems have developed in different ways across jurisdictions which has resulted in approaches to licensing that are not consistent across the country. While mutual recognition schemes have made some attempt to address this, inconsistencies remain and have continued to impact on both small and large businesses and individuals who want to work in more than one jurisdiction. The impact of this has been acknowledged in a number of ways, including in the 2006 Productivity Commission report, <Hansard-Italic>
Re-thinking regulation: Report of the taskforce on reducing regulatory burdens on business</Hansard-Italic>
. COAG agreed to the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy in response to these reports. The NLS is one of the many reforms being undertaken as part of the national partnership. COAG also established the business regulation and competition working group to oversee the range of reforms being undertaken by the national partnership and the National Licensing Steering Committee is supporting the working group in relation to the NLS reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128564"></A>
Aside from COAG-level reforms, the Queensland government is also committed to reducing regulatory burden across business, community and government. Our government’s Smart Regulation Reform Agenda is addressing regulatory burden in Queensland on several fronts. We have set a target of reducing compliance costs to both business and government by some $150 million per year by June 2013. To achieve this the government is simultaneously reviewing the stock of existing regulation and enhancing the quality of future regulation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128565"></A>
Under the Queensland Regulatory Simplification Plan of 2009-13, government agencies are reviewing the existing stock of regulation, removing unnecessary and excessive legislation and streamlining administrative and procurement processes. The regulatory assessment statement system introduced in March this year implements the government’s enhanced regulatory development and review processes which are focused on improving the quality of our new regulation. These initiatives are already delivering savings on top of the national initiatives which will further harmonise and simplify requirements across jurisdictions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128566"></A>
It is important to note that the NLS is not harmonising every aspect of regulations of these occupations. For example, ‘conduct’ requirements will remain the responsibility of participating jurisdictions. It is also important to note that our state based regulators will continue to accept licence applications and administer the licensing system. Finally and importantly, I note and support the Treasurer’s comments in his second reading speech where he puts on the record the Bligh government’s continued support of union representation during the COAG process. I fully support the case for unions to be represented on the National Occupational Licensing Board when the time comes for such appointments to be made. I support the bill and commend it to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(6.27 pm), in reply: I thank all members for their contribution. Can I deal with the issues that were raised in the discussion on this bill this afternoon. In relation to the issues raised about awareness of the changes, it is intended that at a national level, both in the lead-up to implementation and post implementation, there will be extensive communication campaigns that will not just be through associations. That is in answer to the questions from the member for Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128569"></A>
Secondly, in relation to costs, obviously for those licensees who are presently paying fees in more than one jurisdiction, by definition the costs will be reduced for those individuals in those circumstances. Beyond that, it is important to emphasise that the individual fees will continue to be set under the arrangements that are proposed by individual states. Therefore, by and of itself, a move to a national system does not necessarily increase the costs that are relevant to any individual. In relation to costs more generally, it is envisaged that the revenue lost because of the lack of need for entities or individuals to hold more than one licence across jurisdictional borders will be in the order of $3 million. That is a very rough estimate, but nevertheless it is the likely estimate given that, of course, we do not have a national system from which to benchmark. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128570"></A>
The message from the Governor that was provided earlier is merely a precautionary measure. There is no contemplation in the current arrangements that fees would be paid outside of the consolidated fund in Queensland. But if it was the case that into the future a new arrangement was put in place where those monies were, for instance, for a particular profession, collected at a national level, then in order to observe the requirements of the Queensland Constitution such a message needs to be provided for in the passage of the bill in this instance so as not to provide that such a collection into the future would be unconstitutional. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128571"></A>
In relation to the appointment process, it will be the ministerial council on which all ministers sit--not unions--that will make the appointment. Obviously it is intended that the board will be competent, skill based and representative. Ultimately that is the position that the state has advanced through this process. In relation to the intergovernmental agreement, which of course represents the basis for the work, I am happy to table a copy of the intergovernmental agreement for the benefit of the record and all members of the House.</Hansard-Body>

An issue was raised in relation to the disallowance process. It is the case that the disallowance process here is, in fact, more generous than is the case in other national laws--that is, a majority only is required. But ultimately, it is worth making the point that we are not ceding powers irrevocably; that if it was the case that the matter was such that it was felt by this parliament, or indeed the next one or the one beyond that, that the matter was so inappropriate and unable to be endured in Queensland, then there is the ultimate ability to withdraw in a legislative sense. By definition, however, a national system requires a national system of disallowance in order to provide for its efficacy. Ultimately this is, as I said, a national system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128574"></A>
In relation to the requirements about charges, it is the case that charges would only be contemplated on a case-by-case basis. For instance, it is already the case for some occupations such as taxidrivers. I cannot see it being particularly relevant in other occupations, but where the interaction is required; of course, it is required in general terms in this skeletal bill, but the regulations themselves, when they are determined, will work it out into the future. </Hansard-Body>

Regulatory reform is complex, and there are many issues that have been raised through this process. There are a lot of issues that are always to be worked through. It is fair to say that a lot of that will take place over the next 12 months. The challenge here is to not resort to the lowest common denominator; it is to lift up to appropriate higher standards. We are not, as a government, baselining here or wasting time on conducting a baseline exercise. What we are doing is getting on with the job of regulatory reform, putting it into the public arena and inviting industry to make comment on it on the way through. </Hansard-Body>

The other major issue that was raised was in relation to the BSA, which will continue to have a role. It is envisaged that it will continue to have a role.

Clause 4--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134480"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.31 pm): Clause 4 is the operative part of the legislation. It draws into operation in Queensland the national law that was passed in Victoria as the host, if you like, of the substantive provisions of the bill. As it appears as a schedule to this bill, I cannot go through it piece by piece, nor would I want to. But I thought I would use this opportunity to raise any issues that may apply in terms of the bill. There are only a couple. I did raise these issues in my speech on the second reading, and the Treasurer did briefly respond to a couple of the issues that I raised so far as the provision of section 4 of the law is concerned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134481"></A>
Section 4 is the definitions clause of the law. It sets out the definitions including the definition of ‘criminal history’, which I raised in my address on the second reading. Subsection 4(c) refers to ‘charges made against the person for an offence, in a participating jurisdiction or elsewhere, and whether before or after the commencement of this law’. This goes to the issue that I raised previously in terms of criminal history including a charge rather than a conviction for an offence. It has applicability because section 18 of the law covers eligibility for a licence and sets out the principles for eligibility for a licence for an occupation. Then section 19 deals with personal probity. Personal probity includes the requirement of personal probity information. It is the case that sections 4, 18 and 19 all come together in terms of the suitability of people to carry out their job. This would cover a very substantial number of people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134483"></A>
It is also something that has been pointed out by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in their report. In items 13 through to 20 of their report, they raise a number of issues regarding ambiguity about the operation of these clauses and how they inherently stack up. It also relates to the operation of clause 8 of the bill itself, because clause 8 of the bill provides that the licensing authority may ask the Commissioner of Police--so that would be our commissioner--for information relevant to whether the person satisfies personal probity requirements under the occupational licensing national law. So there are a number of provisions of both the law and our bill which all come together in an effort to provide information for the licensing authority when it considers whether it is going to be granting someone a licence to operate in one of the four occupations that are covered here. There are a number of ambiguities in terms of having regard to rights and liberties of individuals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134486"></A>
I also raise the question of spent convictions. If you go to section 19, subsection (2) has a provision which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1134488"></A>
Matters relating to the criminal history of persons will be subject to legislation of participating jurisdictions that prohibits, or does not require, the disclosure of spent convictions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134489"></A>
We have that type of legislation here in Queensland that prohibits the disclosure of spent convictions in five and 10 years time. I am just wondering if the Treasurer is satisfied with these requirements, particularly in relation to charges and spent convictions. We like to give people a chance; a charge is not a conviction. Things come to light that mean charges are dropped or cannot be proceeded with. Also, with spent convictions, it would not be an unusual case for someone perhaps to have a spent conviction who wants to get one of these jobs. Is the Treasurer satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to make sure that people are not unduly prohibited because of those areas in terms of taking on the job? The Treasurer during his reply referred to driving offences. I can certainly see why driving offences would be a part of it, particularly for personal transport services, but that is not charges nor spent convictions. So there is a difference there. Could the Treasurer perhaps address that issue and the resolution of that ambiguity because we will not get a response to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report until after this legislation is passed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134490"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. In my remarks in summing up what I was seeking to explain was not in relation to driving convictions but that charges in relation to a criminal matter are relevant to those areas, for example, where the licence relates to a passenger driving licence--for instance, a taxidriver or a bus driver. So this is to traverse the types of arrangements which are in place both in this state and in other jurisdictions where charges can be considered--for instance, in a blue card scenario where there is interaction with children. The same applies for bus drivers and taxidrivers--charges can be taken into account in terms of making an assessment about the appropriateness of that individual to hold that licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134492"></A>
This does no more in a legislative sense than to seek to provide, because this is skeletal legislation, the head of power in which by individual occupation those matters can be taken into account. I do not envisage that the nature of previous charges that may or may not have fallen away or spent convictions are going to be particularly relevant to the issue of a plumbing licence. I do, however, consider that, as is the case in the law in Queensland at the moment, where such matters are already taken into account in the issue of a licence, they will continue to be allowed to be provided for being taken into account in the future. The reality of course here is that these are matters which will, as the shadow Treasurer rightfully points out, be considered substantively in the regulation-making task that will take place during 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134493"></A>
In essence then, it is required that the national architecture legislation provides for this to occur, because in some instances in some professions in some states already this is the case. Where that applies to individual occupations will be a matter that is determined ultimately by regulation. It is one where--I agree with the shadow Treasurer--all parliaments need to be mindful of the balance between ensuring that individual liberties are protected and the community interest. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 5--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134496"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.38 pm): I understand the Treasurer’s response to the last question. Clause 5 deals with the nonapplicability of certain provisions of Queensland legislation to the operation of the national law. There is quite a lot there. Some of them are quite significant pieces of legislation--obviously the Auditor-General Act, the Financial Administration and Audit Act and the Information Privacy Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134499"></A>
My understanding is that, so far as the law itself is concerned, where it provides for something to be done by the national licensing authority, then the application of those acts to that particular authority is not to apply. But, because it is the delegated model authority, if, for example, one of the delegated licensing authorities in Queensland--one of our departments or offices--is given an obligation to issue licences or to carry out the work under the national licensing authority, then the laws and the rules that are set out in clause 5 and all those subclauses would continue to apply to the operation in Queensland of those Queensland departments and reports would be provided. For example, an RTI application about the number of applications processed by a particular Queensland department or the fees charged or any of those other matters would still be applicable. So that information would still be available under RTI legislation, even though those departments are, in effect, applying the national scheme legislation under the delegated model authority. Can I get clarification that particularly the RTI Act, the Auditor-General Act, the FAA Act and so on are still available, if you like, as part of the accountability measures in relation to the operations of those departments? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140351"></A>
In passing, in my speech during the second reading debate, I referred to the training and skills system and I am not sure if the Treasurer responded to that in his reply. That is a training package development to ensure that training is available for potential licensees to be able to hold those licences. Can the Treasurer also talk about the idea of consensus, which is the 100 per cent agreement in terms of the appointment of the board, and how that will be resolved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140352"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer. In relation to the matters relating to consensus, it is, if you like, a new vogue COAG principle that consensus in fact means 100 per cent agreement. That is a new principle of Commonwealth-state financial relations that has been authored in recent times. That is in the establishment phase. After that, there is an element of majority rule, I have to warrant to the parliament this evening during the debate. Consensus will be required, which is 100 per cent support, for the constitution of the board. Therefore, I expect the matter will ultimately be, in those circumstances, a negotiated outcome.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140353"></A>
In relation to training, the point made is a relevant one, and it is one which the National Occupational Licensing Authority, or NOLA, through its board will have to be mindful of. It is certainly one in which I believe an element of effort will be required by participating jurisdictions to ensure that the models of training in different jurisdictions are in fact recognised through the regulatory making process that will occur in 2011. I consider that to be just one part of the substantive part of the work that will go on during 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140354"></A>
In relation to the issue here, we need to be clear. The explanatory notes to the bill, as tabled, point out that under a delegated agency model the laws of Queensland will all apply to actions undertaken by a state entity. That is, where it is a state department, a state agency or a state statutory authority undertaking one of the aspects or functions contemplated under the law, then all of the laws--whether it is the Auditor-General Act, the Financial Accountability Act, the Right to Information Act or the Judicial Review Act--will apply to those functions of a Queensland agency. But, given that the national authority will also be undertaking activities by and of itself, it is necessary to exclude individual jurisdiction over the efforts of the national authority, otherwise you would find you have seven or eight freedom of information legislations applying and seven or eight Auditor-General acts applying. The potential for nuances in the way those acts are drafted in each jurisdiction would provide for conflict and obviously a level of unworkability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140359"></A>
Therefore, to be clear, the complete architecture of legislation applies whenever it is a state entity undertaking and the architecture at a Commonwealth level applies when it is a Commonwealth entity. In sections 135, 137, 141 and 150 of the national law, it calls up the various pieces of Commonwealth legislation--be it the Ombudsman Act, the Privacy Act, the FOI Act and the Archives Act explicitly on that point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140364"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I appreciate the Treasurer making those points. So far as the consensus issue is concerned, I questioned whether that then gives Queensland, through the ministerial council, effectively a power of veto, but it gives any one member a power of veto ultimately if a member of that council is unhappy with any of the appointments there. In relation to the actions required for training and skills, is that something that would require action by another agency in Queensland? Or is it something that regulations set and then, say, TAFE in Queensland has to take up and put into a training program that requires further action in the state in order to make sure those services are provided and are available? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140365"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Ultimately, for each jurisdiction, it is the Treasurers--the members of the Commonwealth-state federal financial relations ministerial council--who have the sign-off on these arrangements. As it happens, in a practical sense, that means that through the cabinet process the various elements of licensing, of training elements and other attaching issues--whether they are consumer affairs issues or others--are incorporated into the position that each jurisdiction will take. Therefore, the call-up of training issues is one that will occur, as it does in relation to the COAG agenda more generally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140366"></A>
In relation to the issue of 100 per cent consensus being required, your characterisation is correct. My experience of the COAG process of the last couple of months tells me that it is a different beast to where it was a couple of years ago. A couple of years ago, it might have occurred once a year whenever the political theatre of the day required it. It was generally setpiece theatre, such that each actor knew their part, each actor knew when they would exit stage left and everyone was home for dinner. The experience over the last couple of years has been that the bar has been raised to expect that issues are resolved before anyone gets home. I for one have spent a lot longer in places that I would rather not because the idea of those at the table was that the problem needed to be solved, not the theatre engaged in. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (7.47 pm): The Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 has three components. First, it makes a number of largely consequential administrative changes in the VET area; second, it makes some more substantial changes in the area of collection of information from day-care providers; and, third, arguably the principal provision of the bill is that it gives school principals the power to suspend or expel students.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1140387"></A>
Speaking on the child-care information collection initially, these provisions in the bill amend the Child Care Act 2002. They add a new section under clause 4 as an exemption for maintaining confidentiality of child-care service records. The only other current exemption is for legal processes, court presentation and tribunals. In relation to the issue around unaggregated data, there are no provisions on aggregation for disclosure to the Australian Bureau of Statistics or the AIHW. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146313"></A>
Obviously, the collection of data from the unit records of children in child-care centres is a sensitive area. There are concerns--and certainly some concerns have been expressed by the industry in relation to this--that data will be available not just at a statistical level but also through what are called the governing bodies for the child-care industry. There are concerns that the data on individual children will not be used simply for the purposes of statistics but will be used for a range of other uses including the determination and provision of funding within the sector in the case of governing bodies of the quality assurance areas. It would be fair to say that, in common with some participants in the industry, the opposition shares some concerns in relation to information of this nature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146317"></A>
The government announced a new funding model and new arrangements for early childhood education including the new governing bodies and quite significant changes to the funding arrangements. That is part of the reason for these changes. We have some reservations, of course, in the sense that it will add a layer of bureaucracy to the administration of child-care centres. It does indisputably raise the issue that information at the level of individual children will be used more broadly and quite possibly, despite the safeguards in the bill, will be more broadly available. The opposition will not oppose these changes, but we will take the opportunity to express certain concerns that we have in relation to it. Hopefully, putting those on record might contribute to the awareness of them. I will speak to some of those concerns a little later. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146319"></A>
The principle change under the bill is one that was flagged by the government prior to the introduction of the bill back in May, and that was an increase in the power of principals. This is another example of the many that we have seen in this parliament whereby policies put forward by the LNP in this case have been adopted by the government in large part or, in some cases, in entirety. These particular measures fall into the latter category; they mirror exactly the policy that the LNP took to the last state election and that we subsequently reiterated federally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146320"></A>
The education policy of the Liberal National Party at the 2009 state election was that, if the LNP was elected, school principals would be responsible for school discipline with the authority to make the decision at the local level to expel or suspend the student within the approved behaviour or conduct code. Further, it was stated that an LNP government would fund more teachers to provide for rehabilitative programs for suspended or expelled students. These provisions are, in fact, a direct take-out from the LNP policy at the last state election. I am sure that the minister has gathered from the comments that I have made that the LNP will be in full support of what the government is doing here. </Hansard-Body>

Mr Wilson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Thank you for your support of our very good idea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146322"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And why should we not, because it was us who not only put it forward but also took it to an election as part of our platform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146323"></A>
Following that state election, on Tuesday, 7 July 2009 I went to Canberra and issued a joint press release with the federal Liberal shadow minister for education, Christopher Pyne. In that press release we jointly--at the federal and state level--supported new powers to provide greater flexibility for principals to deal with bullying in their schools including suspension and expulsion powers where they do not exist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146324"></A>
There is an array of areas in which the government has been influenced. On 30 October 2009, I was delighted to introduce to this parliament the first piece of legislation aimed at addressing the issue of cyberbullying by outlawing that practice. The government released its cyberbullying brochure to the public on 4 May 2010. Although sometimes it is hard to understand why the government opposes opposition measures, I think most people would be pleased to see a government that will pick up and run with some of the measures put forward by the opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146325"></A>
In relation to principal powers to suspend and expel, I would like to make a very significant point. On 20 April 2009 I read a piece in the <Hansard-Italic>
Townsville Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 in which the Kirwan police officer-in-charge, Senior Sergeant Gary Eddiehausen, said that the biggest problems came from children who had been suspended from school. In common with many stakeholders, we accept that principals need to have this power. We accept that every child who goes to a school in Queensland has a right to an undisturbed education. Where behaviour is so poor as to justify suspension or expulsion, then that becomes necessary to protect the right of another child to a peaceful education. However, it would be a very big mistake to think that, in simply suspending or expelling students, we are solving the problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146327"></A>
A whole range of educational experts have made comment in this area. Suspension and expulsion, firstly, works as a punishment and, hopefully, a deterrent for children who are on the borderline. It also functions to protect the behaviour within the classroom and the right of the other children to access their education. It does not necessarily fix the underlying problem with the child who has been suspended or expelled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146328"></A>
Our Queensland schools are, in our view, best managed by local leaders and local leadership. This is an instance in which the right to make a decision in relation to a suspension or expulsion--and I believe the overwhelming majority of Queenslanders would have believed principals already had this--is being taken away from the bureaucratic and administrative level where that decision lay and being returned to where we believe decision making in schools is most effectively made and that is with the principal. There has really been a philosophical argument over this point. We believe that principals who are given the authority, the rights and the responsibilities for dealing with students and teachers in our schools should, wherever possible, be given the power to make the decisions that affect those children and that they are best placed to make those decisions, not a bureaucrat from a much more remote government department. It has been a very long time since Queensland principals have had this power. In fact, I understand it has been around four decades since this current system was introduced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146329"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wilson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 So it was not changed when you were in government? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152294"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My understanding is that it was about 1964 that this system was changed. That is certainly the information I have in front of me. It has been like that for a very long time. I ran this past a lot of people, even people involved in education. The majority thought that principals already had that power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152298"></A>
This bill inserts a new section into chapter 12 part 3 division 1A, ‘Exclusion of students by principals’. 288A will give the principal the power to exclude a student on grounds such as disobedience, misconduct or other conduct that is so serious that suspension is inadequate to deal with the behaviour. As it states in the proposed legislation, an exclusion can also occur if a student breaches a behaviour improvement condition that has been imposed by the principal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152301"></A>
Echoing the words of Norm Fuller, the President of the Queensland Secondary Principals Association, ‘It is more than appropriate for principals to have this power as we want to ensure that our schools are safe places for students to learn and safe places for our staff to operate and teach.’ I think there are many people who believe parents make choices in relation to where their children are sent to school based significantly on their perception of the level of discipline and order within the school. For parents it is a deal breaking issue if control is seen to be poor within schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152302"></A>
These practices have been in place for over a decade in New South Wales. They were introduced by a Liberal government in the Education Act 1990. These practices are also present in Victoria and South Australia. In these states the power to discipline students with expulsion has rightly been delegated to the principals of schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152303"></A>
There is a burning need for discipline within our schools. Violence in our schools is on the rise. Queensland Teachers Union President, Steve Ryan, stated in the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 on 29 June this year that ‘the level of violence in schools was escalating in line with society.’ I think I share that belief with Steve Ryan from the Teachers Union. I do not think it is particular to schools. I am pretty sure that the minister would support me on that. The instances of violence that we see are across the community. This violence can be impressed upon young people in particular. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152306"></A>
If we go back a generation the worst of violence was perhaps in the cinema or places like that. There was limited exposure to violence. We have moved to a new era now where some children can be exposed to significantly more violence for greater lengths of time through things like the internet. There is a risk of desensitising children. When senior people like Steve Ryan affirm that there is increasing violence in schools I think it is something that we should be very concerned about. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you. He based his claim on the fact that in 1990 Ken Rigby’s figures showed that about one in six school children had been bullied. In 2005 Gene Healy from the University of Western Sydney showed that it had risen to one in five. Last year Professor Donna Cross reported that one in four children are bullied. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152316"></A>
These figures are alarming. With such a high percentage--in fact a quarter--of our students being subject to bullying and harassment, it is imperative that principals have the power to deliver discipline, to deter and to resolve bullying on the ground in our schools. The fact that these bullying figures are increasing, and increasing rapidly, shows that for too long this government has sat on its hands and ignored discipline problems in our school, even though everyone else has been aware of the problem. That also harks back to my earlier comments about our efforts to get the government to act in the area of cyber bullying. </Hansard-Body>

Students cannot learn in a disrupted learning environment. School safety and a calm learning atmosphere are essential for our students to achieve the academic excellence that they are capable of. We have cases in Queensland of teachers undergoing courses to learn how to restrain unruly students using the body hold--as occurred at East Ipswich State School in January this year and reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 on 22 January 2010. Our teachers and our headmasters are a vital resource in the education of young people and, in fact, vital figures in the lives of our young people. It is more than appropriate that we should entrust them with the powers that they need to influence that sort of behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152319"></A>
The rate of expulsions and suspensions in Queensland schools is soaring. I know that the minister would say that this represents a tougher crackdown within schools. There may be some basis for that. But it also suggests that behaviour in our schools is not improving and may even be getting worse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152320"></A>
Expulsions jumped 20 per cent in state schools last year as reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 20 June 2010. In 2008 there were 804 expulsions. In 2009 there were 943. In 2008 short suspensions numbered 51,177 and long suspensions 5,819. By 2009 short suspensions had jumped to 53,405 and long suspensions had soared to 6,794. In 2008-09 average suspensions were 278 students per day, as reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 on 29 June. With South-East Queensland students there were 650 suspensions each week. Some 60,200 suspensions of up to 20 days were issued across the state last year with only 48,684 in 2006. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152322"></A>
These figures are actually quite disturbing. They do reflect on the fact that there are major discipline problems. I would accept from the minister a claim that it does indicate a tougher approach from staff within schools in an effort to try to get behaviour under control. But I think it also represents the fact that there is an underlying problem that we are a long way from getting on top of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152323"></A>
I found two quotes that are pertinent to this particular issue before us. The issue of giving decision making to the local authority within a school--as we see with the issue of suspensions in this bill--is a major philosophical issue within education in this state. One of the quotes is from John Goodlad who is an educational researcher and theorist who has published influential models for renewing schools and teacher education and is in fact the author of around 30 books, 80 chapters and 200 journal articles. John Goodlad said that the guiding principle being put forward is that schools must be self-directing. If we move away from that principle of schools and principals having sufficient autonomy to run and control their schools, then we will see the situation spiral even worse than we appear to have seen already. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1254142"></A>
The other quote is from Terrence Deal. Terrence Deal is a professor at the University of Southern California and an internationally known lecturer and author who has written numerous books on leadership and organisations. Terrence Deal says that the pathway to educational excellence lies within each school. The experts in education understand very comprehensively that if you do not have good decision making, good leadership and appropriate authority within the individual school you cannot get the quality high-level outcomes that we would like to see for all children in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152364"></A>
The amendments that I have been referring to are amendments to the Education (General Provisions) Act 2006. Those amendments--and I will not necessarily go through all of the clause as I have them laid out before me--lay out the procedures and guidelines that principals must use in relation to excluding a student and the grounds on which they can be either suspended or excluded. They also lay down some of the more practical procedures that the principal must follow in terms of what notice should be given; the roles and rights of the student’s parents; the right of replying to the charges that have been put forward as a reason for that action; and the submissions that a child or their family may make, and there is a five-day period for submissions to be made, a period which, by mutual agreement, could be extended. There are also explanations contained in the bill of how a principal must proceed if he decides not to proceed with the expulsion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152366"></A>
In supporting these measures, it comes down to the issue of allowing principals their decisions in relation to running schools and showing them that respect. I am a great believer that if you treat people with respect--if you give them the authority to do the job with which you have charged them, particularly highly professional people--then they are much more likely to rise to that challenge and that level of respect. I will give the House an example that occurs in some schools which shows just how little respect there sometimes is for headmasters and their rights. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1254143"></A>
One such example occurred at the Jindalee State School where for quite a number of years the local councillor, Matthew Bourke, has sponsored the local fete. Prior to Matthew Bourke sponsoring the fete, Felicity Farmer, the Labor councillor for Jamboree ward, sponsored the local fete. On this occasion the headmaster had to ring the councillor and say that he had had a call from local member Julie Attwood and had been instructed that, even though he contributed financially to the fete, he was not to be allowed to sponsor the fete. I rang the school myself to confirm that this was the case. It is absolutely outrageous that a headmaster--someone whom under this bill we are giving the right to suspend or even exclude students--would be directed by a state MP, who said, as I understand, to that headmaster that if he proceeded and allowed the councillor to sponsor the fete, as had been their practice, the minister would not be impressed. That indicates the extent to which the position of a headmaster can be undermined, and that is certainly not something that we would find acceptable in any way, shape or form. The position of headmaster should be respected and when headmasters make decisions in their schools that should also be respected.</Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to the area of child care, there are many changes in the pipeline for early childhood education and care, some of which are causing considerable consternation and a lot of anxiety within the sector. The provisions in this bill are significantly involved in those changes. What this bill does in terms of early childhood education and care is create indisputably an additional layer of bureaucracy and it has created concerns in relation to the privacy of data on children in child-care centres. The URL, the unit record level, data can be disclosed under these amendments to an authorised officer of a central governing body or the chief executive of a relevant service. Information that can be disclosed includes the child’s name, the child’s date of birth, the child’s gender, the child’s primary residential address, their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, the primary language of the child or their family, the healthcare card status of the child’s parents, the diagnosis of medical or disability conditions, assistance required because of a diagnosis, and the hours of kindergarten attended by the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152381"></A>
The breadth of this information should make us look very carefully at any procedures that allow the use of this information. That is pretty much the life story of a child of this age, and much of that information, particularly in relation to addresses and medical diagnosis and disability, is very personal information for those children. With regard to a disability or special need, it may well be that it is useful information. As I have indicated, we are taking it on trust that the safety precautions that this information cannot be misused will be effective. However, I would urge the minister, particularly as this bill is implemented, to ensure that we are very vigilant about the safety measures that are imposed on this information. This is information that is potentially very disadvantageous to a child or their family to have released into the wrong hands. The data can be disaggregated for use by AIHW or the ABS, and again the use of disaggregated and identifying data in dealing with these sorts of specifics is of concern and should lead to a high level of vigilance. The chief executive may use or disclose the data for quality assurance; funding, which is of particular relevance at the present time, with the flux within the funding system; monitoring and reporting on early childhood initiatives; and preparing data for disclosure to the ABS or the AIHW.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158599"></A>
The amendment allows the use of data in what is essentially government policy practice. An authorised employee of a central governing body--and there have been about five central governing bodies that have been set up in Queensland--may use the URL data for quality assuring, funding, planning and developing services for children, parents and guardians and staff members, implementing curriculum development and reporting on the central governing body’s performance. A person authorised to give the information is the licensee of the service, staff member or employee who administers the data. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158601"></A>
Although the information can be used for positive measures, the important concern is the impost on centres. These child-care centres, some of which will be involved in the government’s kindergarten programs, are working in an industry that is subject to very rapid change. Much of that change is quite costly to the industry--changing staff ratios, changing qualification levels for staff. So we have a natural, quite strong concern about any measure that will increase reporting, that will increase the amount of administration and the amount of red tape that these centres will have to deal with. We understand that some changes are necessary because of changes within the industry. To give an indication of the sort of administrative problems that we are very worried about, and which I sincerely hope are not aggravated by the additional reporting contained in this bill, I refer to Condy Park Preschool and Kindergarten, which wrote to me outlining its concerns. The letter states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158604"></A>
I have just been on the phone to the new Kindergartens QLD Smart Service call centre (as directed by the OECEC--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This is the Office for Early Childhood Education and Care--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158606"></A>
new promotional brochure) and was very disappointed and shocked to see that they were unable to find Condy Park as a Kindergarten service provider in Hervey Bay. The only two services found offering the kindergarten services in Hervey Bay were East street and the St James Lutheran and to add to the confusion apparently neither of these are C&amp;K??? After much discussion with the call centre assistant and further investigation on my request, Condy Park was finally found under the Long Day Care Centres Pialba (not anything to do with Hervey Bay) The call centre lady was concerned that I had the post code wrong as Condy Park is not listed as a Hervey Bay Centre. There needs to be immediate attention and changes to this system, as it is not providing accurate information or, for that matter any information about Condy Park as a kindergarten service in Hervey Bay. Condy Park has always been a Kindergarten providing Quality programs run by teachers to the target age group. WE are a triple unit kindergarten service, currently catering for the large majority of Hervey Bay Families with our innovative programs. We are currently affiliated with C&amp;K and are in the process of weighing up all our options as are all kindergartens across the state. We were told that this great new service--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1158609"></A>
for families would inform families of their options and assist them by confirming the centres offering the program they require. My experience was that it was more like a directory assistance number. Actually when calling Telstra directory assistance number they were more helpful in finding Condy Park as a kindergarten in Hervey Bay. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158610"></A>
I have quoted at length from that letter from Condy Park kindergarten--which is one that I am personally familiar with and one that I know to be a very high-quality kindergarten--to show the sort of administrative burden that is falling on these centres. This C&amp;K affiliated kindergarten has been classified by this government as a long-day-care centre and, as such, had its funding imperilled despite assurances that have been given to this House and elsewhere by the minister. They will always, of course, come under the reporting requirements contained in this bill for the information from the URL file for each of their children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158611"></A>
I think we are getting a very clear message from Condy Park--and I do not think that it is the only kindergarten--that there are administrative hiccups in the system. Under this bill, we are now moving to an arrangement where the most personal and intimate details of children will be required by the law we pass here tonight to be given to an array of bodies, including the government, the central governing bodies, the Bureau of Statistics and others. It is very important to ensure that administration is efficient and confidentiality provisions are effective and work. When this bill comes into operation I request of the minister that great vigilance be applied to the administrative processes that are imposed on the state’s many child-care centres. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158612"></A>
In closing, I note that this bill was introduced on 16 May, which is quite some months ago, and at the time it was indicated to be an urgent bill. The bill seems to have continually dropped down the list in the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 as though there was absolutely no urgency whatsoever to pass it. So I hope that the minister in his summing-up explains--there may be some perfectly logical reason--why it has taken so long to debate this bill, given the urgency that was indicated when this bill was introduced. The minister might be able to give us the reasons for the delay in debating the bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (8.26 pm): I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The main objectives are to amend the Child Care Act 2002 to enable the recording, use and disclosure of unit record level data, or URL; to amend the Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 to give state school principals the power to exclude a student enrolled at the principal’s school for a period of not more than one year or permanently; and to amend the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000 to achieve consistency with national curriculum arrangements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158619"></A>
On 6 November 2009, the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs endorsed a National Information Agreement on Early Childhood Education and Care to support the development of nationally consistent, quality early childhood education and care information. The Queensland government signed the agreement on 19 February 2010. These two agencies required jurisdictions to develop the capability for the collection and reporting of unit record level data. Under the agreement, ‘URL’ refers to data on an individual child, which includes their name, date of birth, address and demographic information such as Indigenous status, language background and whether the child has a disability or special needs of some sort or another. The main source of URL data to meet the obligations under the agreement will be the Early Childhood Education and Care Services Census.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158622"></A>
A new funding scheme has been set up to support kindergartens and long-day-care services to deliver approved kindergarten programs. I am happy to announce to the House that two such providers in my electorate were issued with funding grants in the last distribution of funds. Queensland requires URL data to be recorded for the purposes of quality, assuring approved kindergarten provider funding entitlements in 2011 and in the future. Therefore, the amendments to the bill are needed to enable Queensland to collect and report URL data in order to meet its obligations under the National Information Agreement on Early Childhood Education and Care and to make sure that Queensland kindergartens receive the correct funding entitlements for their programs. </Hansard-Body>

I turn now to another example of this Bligh Labor government trying to imitate the Liberal National Party. As the saying goes, imitation is definitely the highest form of flattery. On 18 December 2009, the Minister for Education and Training announced the government’s commitment to grant state school principals the power to exclude students from their schools. One does not have to look too far back in history to see that that formed part of the Liberal National Party policy that was taken to the last state election, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158625"></A>
The school principal will have authority to speak on behalf of the school community and will be responsible for school discipline with the authority to make the decision, at a local level, to expel or suspend a student within the approved (School Behavior) code</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170910"></A>
Once again we find a lazy Labor government taking our ideas and making them its own. Queenslanders are not fooled by such tricks. It is clear that this policy of handing power back to school principals and school P&amp;Cs is well aligned with Liberal National Party policy. It is very similar to our health policy of handing back control of local hospitals to local boards made up from locals in the community. This policy has always been Liberal-National policy and will remain so into the future. Yet again it was another one of our policies stolen not only by the state ALP but also by the federal ALP. No amount of smoke and mirrors from those opposite will change the fact that it was initially part of our policy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164767"></A>
I do have a new and novel idea for the Minister for Education: I have been calling for a feasibility study into the need for a new state high school on the western side of the M1 in Mudgeeraba for five years. When I am out in the electorate of Mudgeeraba I am asked time and time again, ‘When are we going to get our own state high school on the western side of the M1?’ With 36 per cent of our children travelling from west of the M1 to Robina State High School, this rapidly growing young electorate is crying out for a new state high school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164768"></A>
At the last sitting of parliament I had the pleasure of hosting the student leaders and principal of my only state high school, Robina State High School. They had a very educational and informative visit to the House and were very impressed, not only with their meeting with the honourable Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition but also with the work that the Parliamentary Library does. I take the time tonight to thank the Speaker and the Parliamentary Library staff for their time during the last sitting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164769"></A>
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my hardworking principals and their fabulous staff for their dedication, particularly the principals of Mudgeeraba Special School, Mudgeeraba State School, Mudgeeraba Creek State School, Gilston State School, Clover Hill State School and Springbrook, Numbinbah Valley, Merrimac and Robina state high schools. Up until the last redistribution Mudgeeraba was the only electorate on the Gold Coast with eight feeder primary schools and no state high school. Currently the school has 1,367 enrolled students with a capacity of 1,878. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.31 pm): I rise to speak to the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. In doing so, I acknowledge the government’s adoption of one of the LNP’s policies for the 2009 election. Behaviour is, without a doubt, one of the most common concerns voiced by teachers. Students who disrupt classes continually do not just exasperate the teacher; they also sharply diminish the ability of the teacher to communicate with other students. Every minute spent dealing with the bad behaviour of one, two or more students is a minute not spent in teaching and learning. It is a vicious circle. A teacher who must spend the majority of their teaching time dealing with the bad behaviour of a noisy minority of children cannot devote the time they would like to the majority of their students. Some of the better behaving students may fall behind or lose interest, some may succumb to peer pressure adding to the ranks of the badly behaved. Meanwhile the teacher finds it harder and harder to get the class to behave and perform decently. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164775"></A>
Early education is vital education. Any shortfall, particularly in early basic skills such as literacy and numeracy, can follow through to impact on all subsequent education and training. This is indeed a trend that must be nipped in the bud. When a student’s behaviour gets so bad that there is no alternative but suspension or expulsion, doing that has been hindered in the past by layers of bureaucracy and the fact that the principal could not make the decision to exclude a student at a local level. The Bligh Labor government has steadily been eroding the authority of principals, taking away their voice and their power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164776"></A>
In September 2008 the LNP promised that the school principal would have authority to speak on behalf of the school community and would be responsible for school discipline with the authority to make the decision at a local level to expel or suspend a student within the approved school behaviour code. This is only common sense. Principals need to have affective, simple, standard and autonomous powers to deal with issues arising in the daily environment within their school. Antisocial behaviour is one of the biggest problems that occurs and the power of principals to deal with it has been steadily eaten away by this government. Under this bill amendments to the Education (General Provisions) Act will allow a principal to exclude a student from his or her school. This replaces the previous ineffective process where a principal supervisor or chief executive had to act on a recommendation from the principal. The new process finally gives the power to a principal, albeit in a highly bureaucratic manner. The grounds for expulsion are serious disobedience or misconduct. Under this process the principal must give the student a notice proposing exclusion and suspend the student pending a final decision. If a child disagrees with the decision then a review process is available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164778"></A>
While this amendment is overdue and welcome there are other issues that require attention. Schools do require more autonomy. There do need to be better methods and alternatives for implementing order and discipline in our schools and improving the learning environment. Parents do need to be able to trust the school to deliver a safe environment to their children, one where their son or daughter is not going to be terrified of bullying or deprived of the best possible education because of other children’s behaviours. A lot of the problem is in resourcing. Many of our schools are struggling to cope with overcrowded classes and facilities, short-staffing and a burden of administration at the expense of class contact. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164779"></A>
Not all bad behaviour is wilful. Sometimes it can be the result of medical conditions such as autism and the failure of the education department to provide adequate resources to help children with autism spectrum disorders, or ASDs, to engage in the education system. It is pleasing to see that ASDs are now included in the definition of disabilities under this bill in dealing with child-care centres. If only they were included as a recognised separate and countable condition in schools generally, the chances are that resources would be better applied and allocated and parents would have an easier time in accessing services to help their children through school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164780"></A>
The fact that Education Queensland was the only agency that declined to be involved in the Australian Advisory Board on Autism Spectrum Disorders report in 2007 dealing with the prevalence of autism was bad enough. Its reason for failing to cooperate was worse. The report states that the Queensland education department declined to provide data to the study due to concerns that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1164781"></A>
... the use of the term autism is not based on a nationally agreed definition so will lead to inappropriate data comparisons across jurisdictions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1164782"></A>
In addition, there is some contextual information that would be useful to accompany the data to ensure any interpretations and elaborations are based on qualitative as well as quantitative findings. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164783"></A>
It does not get any better. The report details that Queensland was the only state known to have diagnosticians upgrade systems to enable the child to access limited funding resources that were tied to specific diagnoses. As the report says, the practice occurred more frequently in regard to meeting Queensland’s access requirements for special education services than in the completion of Centrelink forms. In other words, Education Queensland does not have the resources to deal with the problems encountered by students with special needs, whether it be the lack of resources for expert support, the lack of programs for teacher training or the lack of funds for learning resources. Early intervention is essential in these conditions so it is pleasing to see the Child Care Act now at least distinguishing ASDs. Now is the time for funding and resourcing to follow. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(8.36 pm): I rise in support of the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. As a former teacher I understand that these new changes will make very big differences in the future, particularly for principals. On the eve of World Teachers Day I would like to congratulate all teachers, particularly those in my electorate where I know many of the schools because I have taught in many of them. I know just how dedicated and committed teachers have to be but also how committed and dedicated they are to our young people, and I send them a very, very big congratulations for tomorrow. We need them and we thank them. </Hansard-Body>

This government is definitely committed to ensuring that state schools remain safe places for students to learn and for teachers to teach. Without that commitment of safety then we cannot really teach and people do not feel happy about going to work. The new power for principals to exclude students is only one part of helping principals to manage poor behaviour in schools--only one part. As a former teacher I used to have an alternative program at Townsville State High School. </Hansard-Body>

We are implementing a range of other initiatives to promote positive behaviour in schools. I will not go into that tonight. I think most people have already spoken on that. I would like to congratulate the government, which has shown its commitment to addressing behaviour in schools through the engagement of two consultants in the past year--Dr Ken Rigby and Dr Michael Carr-Gregg--to enhance the responses to bullying. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (8.40 pm): I rise in support of the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill. I am particularly interested in a principal’s power to exclude students. This government takes school safety very seriously and is committed to making every effort to enhance the safety of staff, students and the school community. Schools are among the safest places in the community for young people. However, we will not hesitate to take any necessary action to make schools even safer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171030"></A>
There is already a range of strategies in place in Queensland state schools to promote safe and disciplined learning environments. State school principals have extensive decision-making powers about school operational issues which enable them to take swift, firm and decisive action to ensure the safety of staff and students. Every state school has a responsible behaviour plan for students which outlines the standards of behaviour expected from students in a school and the disciplinary measures that may be given to students when those standards are not met. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171031"></A>
I have spoken in this House before about a wonderful program called 3R--Retrieval, Resilience and Reintegration. The program identifies students between the ages of eight and 14 years who are at risk of being expelled from school. It provides students with the skills to be able to cope more effectively and strategies to enable them to respond appropriately in the classroom, improving their social abilities as well as their learning abilities. The whole purpose of the program is to enable children to return to their own schools and resume their education with the ability to actively participate in school life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171033"></A>
3R is based at the Tallebudgera Beach Outdoor Education School, and I commend the principal, Allan Rafton, for his commitment to this very worthwhile program. This week I hosted a lunch in the dining room for Tanika, Jack, Cooper, Jay and Jordan--five students from 3R--together with their three teachers. They had won the invitation based on their good behaviour and were so proud of themselves. I want to acknowledge the support and encouragement given to these young children, aged between eight and 11, by their teachers Di Bowerman, Krystal Kiss and Jan Large. These are teachers who put an enormous amount of time and effort into giving children an opportunity to change their behaviour and attitude and, hopefully, be returned to their school. While there was some concern about how the children would behave, I can report that everything went well, much to the delight of the teachers and full credit to the children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171035"></A>
Behaviour that puts the safety and learning of other students at risk should not be tolerated in our schools, and behaviour such as physical assault, drug or weapon possession and property damage can now be addressed. Giving state school principals the power to directly exclude students enrolled at their school will send a strong message to students and parents that poor behaviour is not tolerated in our schools. These new principal powers, in combination with the Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence and other existing departmental initiatives, are the key to maintaining safe school communities. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Woodridge--ALP) (8.43 pm): At the outset I would like to say how much I appreciate what the principals and teachers are doing in my schools. Schools are the most exciting places in our electorates at the moment. Who would ever have dreamed that in the face of a great economic downturn we would end up with such a wealth of new facilities. In my case with national partnership schools, the extra money is making a real difference. So there are good things happening in our schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171039"></A>
This is a very important piece of legislation because it is designed to give power to principals to ensure their schoolrooms are places where students are able to learn in a healthy, safe environment, free from disruption and inappropriate behaviour. However, it goes further than that and seeks to ensure that students who are excluded from a school are then able to access an alternative form of education until a final decision is made and, should they not be able to return to the school, then to continue their education in a facility which might be more appropriate to their needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171041"></A>
It has always been a great concern of mine as to where our students go who either drop out of school or are excluded. I remember when Matt Foley was in this place and spoke about 10,000 young people in Queensland not in work and not in school.</Hansard-Body>

 That is true. Our district director of education at the time, Kerry Holst, did a survey and indications were that there were at least 2,000 of those in Logan City. It was at that time that the ETRF--the Education and Training Reforms for the Future--was implemented and many innovative programs commenced. For many and sometimes complex reasons, some young people do not fit into our normal school regime. I believe my electorate of Woodridge is well served with a number of alternatives, and I have witnessed many, many lives turned around and young people re-engaged through these alternative options. Sometimes it is as simple as smaller student groups and building confidence and self-esteem in a young person. The words often repeated are, ‘This is the first time anyone has taken any interest in me or said “well done”.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171050"></A>
I would like to compliment our alternative schools and behavioural management units in Logan. Woodridge High has long had a behavioural management unit and the Centre Education Program, under the leadership of Lorraine Brown and operated under the Edmund Rice tradition by the Christian Brothers, has enjoyed incredible success with a high percentage of Indigenous students. BoysTown, with manager, Anne Chandra, has for many years worked with young people at risk in vocational training, Skilling Queenslanders for Work, literacy, numeracy and a very diverse range of both dynamic practical subjects and skills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171058"></A>
Early in the first phase of Community Renewal in the Woodridge-Kingston area, an unused wing of Kingston College was converted into a continuing education centre, where we have now seen thousands of mostly young people return for a second chance at education. Several years ago, I and a number of my colleagues received an email from Michelle Venables from the YMCA seeking a shed to work with at-risk young people. I remember ringing Michelle and telling her that my community was already out looking for a shed and to tell anyone else who rang, ‘Sorry, it’s already taken.’ We quickly found a shed and it was here that the very successful U-Turn program was run, turning many, many lives around. The YMCA has now built their own facility beside BoysTown in Mary Street, Kingston, and have just commenced their alternative school--the Clem Jones Campus, under the direction of Matthew Swift--where I know many young people will receive tuition, vocational training and a holistic education which will see many young lives affected in a very positive way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171066"></A>
Our principals, teachers and other staff in our schools work extremely hard and it is simply wonderful to see our improved facilities thanks to the BER by our federal government, as well as increased funding for staff and improved programs under the national partnership arrangements. We are witnessing great results. However, for our students who do need an alternative--and our schools make exclusion an absolute last resort--help is available. What is often needed is an attitude change and it is the special teachers and social workers who have skills to work with young people at risk who can often get alongside a young person to inspire them to continue with their education or to seek skills training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177264"></A>
Every young life is of great worth. I recall one manager at the YMCA saying to me, ‘Don’t bring the bright young people to me. I want to work with those who haven’t had a chance in life, who are behind the eight ball. I want to work with them to see their lives change for the better.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177267"></A>
Education and training is the key for every individual, and this bill will allow our principals to better manage their schools, with the safeguards of an appeal mechanism to the director-general should a student or parent feel the decision is flawed or unfair. I want to thank those who worked on bringing this bill to the House. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (8.49 pm): Firstly, I want to say how privileged I have been to be able to share the 100th anniversary of one of the leading educational institutions in this state, the University of Queensland. It has celebrated its 100th anniversary and I have had the opportunity to join in a number of those celebrations. I am very fortunate to have the University of Queensland in my electorate. I also have a number of very fine schools. I had the opportunity to attend the 57th annual awards night at the Indooroopilly State High School this week. I want to congratulate all of the students who did win awards that night. On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge that a family friend of ours, Lucy Tonge, has been elected as the head girl at Brisbane Girls Grammar. It has been a real privilege to watch Lucy grow up to be such a fine, enthusiastic, caring and inspiring young woman. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I was pointing out, obviously the member for Everton does not grasp the idea of what plagiarism is. What we do not see tonight is the acknowledgement from our opponents of how often they steal the LNP’s policies. What we are really seeing here is a government that is bereft of ideas. It has not seen anything new for this term at all. It is time for government members to leave. Once again, we have seen this minister steal an idea from the LNP. Of course, stealing is not unusual from those on that side of the House either. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177284"></A>
As I said, this policy we are discussing tonight--particularly the issue of giving principals greater powers--mirrors almost exactly what the LNP policy was at the election 18 months ago. Under the LNP’s 2009 education policy, it was proposed that if the LNP were elected school principals would be responsible for school discipline, with the authority to make the decision at a local level to expel or suspend a student within the approved behaviour code. Further, it was stated that an LNP government would fund more teachers to provide for rehabilitation programs for suspended or expelled students.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177285"></A>
Let me read from that policy, entitled ‘Empowering parents and maintaining school discipline’. It stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177287"></A>
Parents don’t only need a greater say in their child’s school; they have a right to a greater say.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177288"></A>
An LNP government will stop the policies of the Beattie-Bligh Labor government that are seeing our schools become failed social experiments controlled from a centralised office in Brisbane. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1177289"></A>
How many parents come and see me at P&amp;C meetings and say that is exactly what has been happening under this government and this minister. The policy continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177291"></A>
An LNP government will ensure: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Parents have a say on school behaviour codes: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177293"></A>
Parents will be empowered to determine behaviour codes for their child’s school in consultation with the school principal. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177295"></A>
This next bit is the important part and the member for Everton should listen to this to understand plagiarism. He should note the government’s policy that we are discussing tonight and then listen as I tell him what the LNP policy was 18 months ago. The LNP policy stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177296"></A>
The school principal will have authority to speak on behalf of the school community and will be responsible for school discipline with the authority to make the decision, at a local level, to expel or suspend a student within the approved code.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1177297"></A>
That sounds very similar to what we are debating tonight--we have the LNP policy and then we see the ALP once again plagiarising that LNP policy. As I said before, this is a government that is bereft of ideas.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177298"></A>
What did government members do when the LNP announced that policy 18 months ago? You guessed it: they attacked that policy 18 months ago, and now 18 months on they are adopting the policy. Have we not heard that before in this place over and over again on numerous pieces of legislation, including just this week. This government rules out something and then steals that idea, and we have seen it again tonight. We now have Labor doing exactly what the LNP said should be done. One could say it is better late than never. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177299"></A>
The education minister said it had become crucial for principals to take a stand on behaviour. He said, ‘We make no excuse about making sure tough action is taken,’ so why has Labor taken 18 months to adopt the LNP’s policy? The minister now admits that Queensland state school principals seeking to expel problem students get bogged down in too much red tape and are often overruled by regional supervisors. Again, this revelation, this epiphany for this minister, is 18 months too late. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177301"></A>
It was interesting that Professor Geoff Masters’s report into Queensland education confirmed what the LNP already knew. In his April 2009 report, <Hansard-Italic>
A shared challenge: Improving literacy, numeracy and science learning in Queensland primary schools</Hansard-Italic>
, Professor Masters identified ways of improving the performance of Queensland students and noted that highly effective schools were those in which--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177304"></A>
Class time is used as learning time, classrooms are calm and busy, and interruptions to learning are discouraged ... The school provides an environment that is safe and caring ... and values of respect, tolerance and inclusion are promoted throughout the school. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177306"></A>
It is interesting to note that my colleague the excellent member for Aspley, Tracy Davis, indicated that earlier as well. She said how important that was when she goes to P&amp;C meetings. I know how hard she works in her electorate, and that electorate loves the fact that they have a new member who is out there doing the work, going to the schools. That is what P&amp;C members tell her too--how important it is to have a classroom where teachers have the opportunity to teach and students have a chance to learn in a classroom that is calm and not damaged by disruptive behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177309"></A>
As the Parliamentary Library research brief indicates, there has been mounting concern among parents about increasing incidents of bullying and school violence, highlighted by the fatal stabbing at a school in Brisbane’s north-east in February 2010. Attacks at other Queensland schools have also been reported as teachers attempt to reassure parents that schools are still safe places. Even more alarming is that, within days of that Queensland incident, there appeared to be a spate of knife attacks on students by students across the country, in what an <Hansard-Italic>
Age</Hansard-Italic>
 newspaper reporter described as a ‘week of knives’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177311"></A>
It has also been reported that teachers are becoming disenchanted with students who are rude and disengaged and who disrupt the classroom. New teachers are resigning and retiring early, with a 2008 Australian Education Union survey of new secondary school teachers ranking student misbehaviour as the chief cause of complaint while primary school teachers ranked it second. It has been said that these concerns have increased since 2005. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177313"></A>
The Queensland principals association president, Norm Hart, has said that principals would exercise this exclusion power as a last resort and that he did not believe it would lead to a greater number of exclusions. The Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens’ Associations president, Margaret Black, said she did not believe the changes would have a major impact on the way expulsions were handed out. She said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177316"></A>
Currently, a principal prepares all the paperwork and someone else signs it. Now, a principal will sign the paperwork instead. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177317"></A>
I’m sure principals will make sure everything’s in order before they sign it. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177318"></A>
Given the LNP proposed this 18 months ago--and the ALP attacked it--the LNP will not be opposing these changes. In conclusion, can I say to this minister that it is better late than never, but we wish ALP members had actually listened to us 18 months ago, rather than attacking our policy then and now claiming it for themselves. This is another example of ALP plagiarism. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (8.59 pm): I, too, rise to contribute to the debate on the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill. The Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 addresses several important but, as the member for Indooroopilly just highlighted, long overdue changes to education and child care. Firstly, I acknowledge that I am pleased to see the inclusion of autistic spectrum disorders in the definition of disabilities. Assisting the development of young children with autism spectrum disorders places significant stress on families, and it is my hope that the acknowledgement of this disorder will provide much needed support to these families. According to Autism Spectrum Australia, one in 160 Australians has an autistic spectrum disorder, emphasising the need for support for these children in our child-care system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183856"></A>
A child who has trouble communicating can face many difficulties when first beginning their schooling, and this acknowledgement of autistic spectrum disorders in the child-care sector will help provide a framework of support for the development of these children. Information collected from the child-care sector could provide important insight into planning and monitoring of outcomes of early childhood initiatives as well as ensuring that relevant services and approved kindergarten programs receive the appropriate funding. This kind of statistical information can be used to tailor kindergarten programs directly to students’ needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183857"></A>
Clearly, great minds think alike--or at least this legislation lends itself to the obvious--as my next comments echo those of my good colleague the member for Indooroopilly. Yet again the Bligh Labor government has used its powers of plagiarism to pilfer yet another LNP policy. Let me quote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1183859"></A>
The school principal will have authority to speak on behalf of the school community and will be responsible for school discipline with the authority to make the decision, at a local level, to expel or suspend a student within the approved (school behaviour) code. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1183860"></A>
This next quote is from a slightly different source. It states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1183862"></A>
The ability to make decisions about discipline within their school, including the exclusion of students, is key to confirming principals’ authority to the school community and in driving improved student behaviour, school performance and increased principal accountability. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1183863"></A>
School principals will have the ‘power to exclude a student enrolled at their school for a period of not more than one year or permanently’. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183864"></A>
The similarity is blinding. To the untrained eye it would be very difficult to tell which quote came from the LNP’s education revival to make Queensland top of the class again released prior to March last year and which quote came from the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 explanatory notes. Astonishing! Does the Bligh Labor government really think that it can continue to hoodwink the media and hoodwink Queensland voters into believing the LNP is a policy free zone? How can it honestly believe it can get away with that when for the third time this week we are debating legislation that mirrors LNP policy and private members’ bills? First there was the carers bill, then the penalties and sentences bill and now the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill. Let me thank the Bligh Labor government, because by presenting this bill to the House it has put paid to its own propaganda and spin once and for all that the LNP has no policies.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1183869"></A>
Before I conclude, I have not yet had an opportunity to acknowledge a success for the parents, students and staff at Elimbah State School. Back in June I raised in this House the concerns of the Elimbah school community that the government continued to deny them a safe pedestrian crossing on Beerburrum Road. The government’s prevarication meant that young Grace Giampino was struck by a vehicle when crossing the road with her older brother. Fortunately, Grace was not seriously injured, but this incident was the last in a decade of incidents and rightly pushed the school to breaking point. Finally, after a decade of despair and a concerted campaign during the past six months, the school community can rejoice. We have succeeded in getting not only a new and improved physical crossing, but also a funded crossing supervisor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183874"></A>
As I conclude, I thank Sharon Webb, the tireless P&amp;C president and her band of passionate mums and dads. I would like to thank Grace Giampino and her family. I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts and financial contribution made by Councillor Adrian Raedel and the Moreton Bay Regional Council and also the staff at the Department of Transport and Main Roads. </Hansard-Body>

I, as a current serving member within the defence force would like to thank you and your staff for fighting to get funding to have a guard positioned at that particular crossing. I believe that my daughter’s life is worth a lot more than the $15,000. As a serving member I am proud to serve and protect this fine country of ours, I thank you for your service and for protecting my daughter and other children and averting a catastrophe. Thankyou.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>

Before I resume my seat I will also touch on one other matter, which relates to the amendment to the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000 which, the minister said in his second reading speech, was to achieve consistency with national arrangements. I remind the minister of a meeting we held some time ago with small training organisations that do not receive any state or federal government funding to provide their training to people who want to improve their skills in a whole range of services. The issue that was raised with the minister and his departmental officers at that meeting was a concern that the compliance requirement basically challenged the very ability of these small training organisations to actually deliver the training programs to students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183894"></A>
I am hoping the minister will clarify what is intended by these amendments that he is proposing in this bill. I would be very disappointed if it is the case that this amendment is actually going to make it more difficult for small Queensland training organisations that do not receive state or federal government funding to be able to continue to provide the very important training services that they are currently providing in this great state of Queensland. If it is the case that we are simply adopting national scheme legislation because the bureaucracy says that’s the way we have to go, if it is because we are adopting this national scheme legislation because the major training organisations which receive state or federal government funding say, ‘Yes, we will do it because we have to because we are receiving state government funding,’ then I would say that we need to have another look at it to ensure this national scheme legislation and these amendments are not going to challenge the viability of the very small business operators who are training people in Queensland. They are doing a great job. I will resume my seat. I look forward to the minister’s reply to the concerns I have raised. I seek clarification of the implications of this second part of the amendment dealing with the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (9.08 pm), in reply: I thank honourable members for the opportunity to speak in reply to this debate. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the second reading debate on this bill. I will make some general observations and respond accordingly to some comments that have been made.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183900"></A>
Firstly, I will take up some of the issues raised by the member for Moggill. The member’s claim that Labor stole some of their policies is, of course, ludicrous. Principals are responsible for the safety and education of our students every day. This is the highest level of responsibility that they could have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183901"></A>
I thank the honourable member for Nicklin, who has identified well that we need to be far more thoughtful about responding to the needs of principals as the supreme leaders of our schools--school by school--and that is what we are seeking to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183938"></A>
I have been in this very privileged position of Minister for Education and Training for 18 months and I have talked to as many principals and as many teachers as I can, school by school, around the state. More importantly, I have spoken to many, many parents. They have confirmed my own sense as a parent that we need to affirm the leadership role and responsibility of principals of our schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183939"></A>
We give them the responsibility for managing a large financial budget for that school and the livelihood of students between 50 in number to 2,500 in number. If we have trusted them with that responsibility then we should be able to put this particular power that we are providing in this bill in their hands to use in a most wise and careful way. It is only natural that principals would have, in addition to the extraordinary range of powers and responsibilities that they have, the responsibility to exclude students as a last resort--and I underline as a last resort--who for whatever reason are not able to meet the high expectations that we know parents expect teachers and principals to demand of students in their schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183940"></A>
I would remind the member for Moggill that the responsible behaviour plans for students that are in each state school are developed in consultation with school communities. At the end of the third quarter of last year I requested all state schools--all 1,230 of them--to, in consultation with their P&amp;Cs, review their responsible behaviour plans to ensure that every school plan reflects the expectation of the school community about the appropriate behaviour of principals. Principals have acknowledged that these are important powers and that they will use them in a very wise way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183941"></A>
In addition to that, the state government in the state school sector will provide more than $33 million to strengthen school discipline, promote positive student behaviour and support better initiatives in the financial year 2010-11. These resources are used to employ behaviour specialists and provide alternative facilities for students, such as positive learning centres, to address their behaviours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183942"></A>
A key objective of the bill is for state schools to achieve better learning outcomes for all students by having adequate powers at the local school level to maintain appropriate high levels of discipline and promote positive student behaviour. The decision to exclude a student is not made lightly. Schools use all available means to support students to change their behaviour before considering exclusion. Every principal and every teacher wants nothing better than the full engagement of every student that they have in every class in every school. It is a matter of considerable moment that a teacher and a principal would be considering as a last resort the potential exclusion of a particular student. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183943"></A>
Students are only excluded if their behaviour is extremely serious and other support strategies and disciplinary measures implemented by the school have regrettably been unsuccessful. The government will provide, as I said, $33 million to strengthen school discipline and promote positive student behaviour in this financial year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183944"></A>
These amendments are part of a strategic response to managing student behaviour which includes enhancement of the case management of students who are excluded to ensure their continued engagement in education. The case management guidelines will specify the responsibilities for regions of Education Queensland to appoint case managers who will in turn record all contact made with students and their families, track student destinations, monitor the student’s education program and work with other agencies if required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183945"></A>
The case management guidelines will focus not only on ensuring that all students are provided with an appropriate educational program during the process of exclusion but also on ensuring the continued education of students in another state school, alternative education program, TAFE or other training or work placement following the exclusion to enable students to reach their full potential. Principals, school administrators and regional staff will be provided with training to enhance their decision-making skills to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in the decision-making process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183947"></A>
I emphasise that the new process for exclusion of a student by a state school principal is the same as the existing process for a principal’s supervisor. This means that a principal will be able to exclude a student enrolled at the principal’s school on the same grounds as previously the principal’s supervisor unless it would be inappropriate for the principal to make the exclusion decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183948"></A>
What is critically different is that we are repositioning the power of exclusion from that of the principal’s supervisor to the principal themselves. Students and their parents will be afforded natural justice by having the ability to make submissions to the principal about a proposed exclusion and to appeal the principal’s exclusion decision. I want to make the important point that, at the moment, in 90 per cent of cases a principal’s decision to recommend the exclusion of a student is presently confirmed by the principal’s supervisor. This indicates that state school principals are already making, in the main, sound decisions in the vast majority of cases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183949"></A>
I turn to the amendments relating to record level data. These amendments serve a dual purpose. Firstly, they ensure Queensland meets its obligation under the national information agreement on early childhood education and care. Secondly, allow the Department of Education and Training to quality assure funding provided to approved kindergarten providers. That is ultimately for the purpose of serving the needs of parents whose children are in kindergarten services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183951"></A>
The collection of unit record level data will only apply to children enrolled in an approved kindergarten program and to staff members of relevant services who deliver an approved kindergarten program. A relevant service may only disclose unit record level data to the director-general of the Department of Education and Training and authorised officers of a central governing body. The director-general may only disclose the data to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare or an authorised officer of a central governing body. The Department of Education and Training will code information such as names and addresses before providing it to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183953"></A>
Any reports, based upon this data, can only refer to aggregated data level and cannot identify directly or indirectly any individual child or staff member. Unit record level data about individual children is the type of data that is already collected by services as part of the existing enrolment process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183954"></A>
Once the amendments commence, parents of affected children will be asked to update their child’s enrolment information to ensure that records are accurate. Relevant services will be required to provide a privacy notice to parents with this request to explain the terms under which the information is being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. Although there will be some additional reporting involved in providing unit record level data about staff members, it will be to ensure that services receive the correct funding entitlements for providing a kindergarten program and that child-care services are well targeted to meet the needs of Queensland children. I should underline that I am advised by the department that this amendment reflects similar legislation that has been adopted in other states as they seek to fulfil their obligations under the national quality agreement with the federal government supporting the increased federal funding of kindergarten teaching throughout the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1183956"></A>
We will work closely with the relevant services to minimise the reporting burden while ensuring that the requirements for funding and accountability are met. I emphasise that the bill ensures a person’s privacy is protected by establishing adequate safeguards to ensure that information is only recorded, used and disclosed for the purposes set out in the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190641"></A>
The bill also makes minor amendments to the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000 to ensure compliance with the national skills framework by expanding the definition of ‘statement of attainment’ to include a skills set as an additional category of achievement that may be certified by a registered training organisation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190642"></A>
Before concluding I want to respond to the particular matter raised by the member for Nicklin. The member for Nicklin raised quite a legitimate point about the importance of ensuring that either state regulation regarding the training sector or the gradual transition to a nationally regulated training sector across the country must ultimately ensure that it is designed in such a way that we facilitate and not hinder or hamper the delivery of training on the ground community by community, particularly by small training organisations that are often times the greatest in number of the training organisations that we have in the training sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190643"></A>
I hear well his exultation that red tape and the burden of accreditation, the burden of document compliance and the filling out of information requirements is one that needs to be carefully guarded against to ensure that the good purpose and worthwhile objective of national regulation to ensure high-level quality of training being provided to apprentices and trainees around the country does not become overburdened by excessive regulation and red tape. I can assure the member for Nicklin that the issue that he has raised and which he raised with me some long time ago is one that Queensland has actively pursued at the national level with the council of education and training ministers. We will continue to push that concern to ensure that ultimately the very good purpose that we are pursuing--that is, of assisting training organisations on the ground delivering high-quality training--is one that is well promoted by the regulation and the national regulatory systems that we are setting up and not one that is impeded and made more difficult for those very good training organisations, including the TAFE system, that are doing such fantastic work around the state and around the nation. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (9.23 pm): I note that clause 5 recognises an autistic spectrum disorder as a disability. I ask the minister to clarify a little more for us. There are two areas of concern, Minister, with this aspect of the bill. One is the administrative burden on early childhood centres and the other one is the deal of highly confidential information on children in play as a result of the liberalisation of access to it in this clause. Given that, what process will be in place--I do not mean simply the provisions in the bill but ongoing monitoring--to ensure that this information on young children is treated in the strictest of confidence?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190654"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. In relation to the point that he asks about, the same approach will be taken to the administration of the legal obligation attaching to privacy and confidentiality as presently pertains to privacy and confidentiality requirements in other legislation that is the responsibility of my department to administer and legislation throughout government. That is the high standard that will be continued and replicated in the administration of the privacy and confidentiality requirements in this legislation and in this amendment. I certainly recognise the point that the member is making, and it is a point fairly raised. One can understand that it is a concern that people naturally have, and that is why I say that the standard of administration of this legal obligation attaching to confidentiality and privacy is the same high-level standard that presently applies to the administration of similar obligations of privacy and confidentiality that already attach to the Child Care Act and other relevant acts within the responsibility of the Department of Education and Training.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190657"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thanks, Minister. I appreciate that. In the case of this very sensitive information on three- and four-year-old children, the level of care actually needs to be even higher than in some other circumstances. Does the minister propose to have any ongoing surveillance of the way this clause works out in practice--because it is something that is going to affect the industry widely--with a view to, if there are areas where information may not be safeguarded as stringently as it needs to be, review and coming back and modifying the procedures?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190658"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The implementation of the state’s obligations under the national quality agreement with the federal government, as well as the obligations attaching to the rollout of universal access to kindergarten, require that the Office for Early Childhood Education and Care engages closely and regularly with all industry stakeholders not only in the kindergarten sector, the creche and kindergarten sector and community kindergarten sector but also in the child-care sector. That close engagement is well underway and it is a foundational element of the rollout of this major reform that is taking place throughout Queensland over the next several years. Part of that close engagement involves regularly seeking feedback from child-care providers and kindergarten providers of the way in which the program is being rolled out and the opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that rollout as we go month by month. That would include--and I would look to it including--any feedback by those services regarding improvements and additions that we can make to the way in which confidentiality and privacy attaches quite firmly to the collection of this important information that is sensitive but important for the effective delivery of this very important program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190696"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Clause 5 of the bill proposes to insert a number of new definitions into the Child Care Act, including a new definition of what may be considered to be a disability for any purpose relating to the application of that act. The new definition states the following--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1190698"></A>
Disability includes a condition attributable to--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1190699"></A>
(a) 	a physical, intellectual, hearing, vision or speech-language impairment, or a developmental delay; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1190700"></A>
(b) 	an autistic spectrum disorder; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1190701"></A>
(c) 	a combination of impairments mentioned in paragraph (a), a developmental delay or an autistic spectrum disorder. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190703"></A>
Subclauses (b) and (c) of this definition are significant because for the first time autism spectrum disorder will be included within the broader definition of ‘disability’ for the purposes of the Child Care Act. This means that behaviour management programs, remedial, or special needs learning programs can be justified and funded on the basis of this data. Previously, Education Queensland has not had access to ASD specific records for this purpose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190704"></A>
 During the hearing of Estimates Committee D this year I referred to a 2007 report from the Australian Advisory Board on autism spectrum disorders that stated that it could not use Queensland figures because Education Queensland declined to provide any data on the basis that there is no nationally agreed definition of autism and that Disability Services Queensland did not keep ASD specific data. Is the definition of ASD in this bill a nationally agreed definition? Will Queensland now be able to provide statistics to national reports concerning ASD?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190707"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take some advice from the department on the question raised. Firstly, I was not a member of Estimates Committee D so I make no comment about what the member did say or did not say and what anyone else may have said or not said in the context of the Estimates Committee D hearings. Secondly, I am advised by the department that the expression ‘autistic spectrum disorder’ has been included in the definition of ‘disability’ by the Office for Early Childhood Education and Care for the purpose, in its view, of fulfilling the obligations that the department has under the national quality agenda and the universal access to kindergarten agreements with the federal government and not for the purpose of aligning or not aligning with what might be definitions of autistic spectrum disorder in other states or at a national level in respect of which statistics are collected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190711"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Clause 5 of the bill also inserts into the Child Care Act a definition requiring that, to be counted and collected, the child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder must be (a) diagnosed by a health practitioner as having, or is suspected by a health practitioner of having, a disability or long-term medical condition and (b) needs additional assistance because of the disability or medical condition. In addition to the inadequacies that I pointed out earlier in terms of the ability of Education Queensland to collect data pertaining to ASD until the provisions of this bill make it a possibility for the department to inform funding arrangements and have the allocation of resources for the support of children diagnosed with ASD, a concern that has been regularly expressed by people in the community, and indeed by members of this House over a long period of time, is the manner in which health practitioners have diagnosed autism spectrum disorder. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190712"></A>
At this point I would like to place on the record a considerable campaign mounted by the member for Murrumba over the past six years to draw the attention of the government to his concerns about what appears to be an inordinate rate of diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder among children in Queensland. For the benefit of the House, I table the contribution during the budget reply by the member for Murrumba on 17 June 2004, I table the member for Murrumba’s contribution of 29 November 2006 during the Education Legislation Amendment Bill, I table a speech by the member for Murrumba on 11 November 2008 pertaining to autism and I table a contribution to the House by the member for Murrumba on 19 June 2009 in respect of autism.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1190714"></A>
Over the past six years the member for Murrumba has demonstrated a commitment to raising awareness in this House and in Queensland of his concerns about a perceived overdiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder among children in Queensland. His commitment has been hampered by the fact that neither Education Queensland nor Disability Services Queensland has had an adequate mechanism to collect data pertaining to the rate of diagnoses of children suffering from ASD in this state. I draw that to the attention of the Minister for Education in the hope that, as the provisions of this bill now allow for the collection of data for ASD among children in Queensland, the aggregation of that data may lead to a more detailed analysis of what is a significant overdiagnosis of ASD among children in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190715"></A>
The member for Murrumba must be acknowledged for his persistent campaign to raise awareness of this issue and in particular to draw to the attention of the government the serious problems associated with the rate of diagnosis of ASD in Queensland. All I can say to the member for Murrumba is that we ought to welcome this small step--the collection of unit level data pertaining to the number of children being diagnosed with ASD in Queensland--in the hope that it may lead to the government taking seriously the excessive and worrying rate of ASD diagnosis among children in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190716"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the points that he has raised. Firstly, I rely upon my earlier response to his first question regarding the addition of the expression ‘autistic spectrum disorder’ to the definitions in this bill and also make him aware, if he is not otherwise already aware, that Education Queensland is--and has been for a short time at least--endeavouring to identify a new approach to the whole question of not just autistic spectrum disorder but the broader question of the diagnosis of particular identified disabilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1190717"></A>
Education Queensland has commenced a special research trial in a number of areas, one of which is in the Logan area, called the response and recognition trial, which the member may not be aware of. That trial is in a number of schools and is taking place over a year or so. The objective of that trial is to identify whether there is an opportunity to go beyond the device of relying upon a particular medical diagnosis for the purpose of identifying what is the appropriate level of educational support that should be provided to a student to assist them to have the opportunity of an educational experience to an acceptable level or standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1197511"></A>
The purpose of the trial is, as I suppose the title of the trial indicates, to try to shift from medical diagnosis as a trigger for additional educational support to one of assessing what are the educational needs of a particular student and what might be the educational support provided to that child to meet those educational needs, however so arising those needs might be through whatever particular type of disability, so that the educational support is delivered to match the identified educational need, to release the process of assessing what is the appropriate educational support from its current dependency upon a particular medical diagnosis or not diagnosis. That will take some time to work through. It is being done as a thorough, serious, comprehensive exercise. Should it be successful, and of course we are hopeful that it will be, then we may be able to ultimately move beyond the position of some differences that occur between states and at a national level about not only this particular condition but also other disability conditions and how they are differently defined state by state and how they may be differently measured and counted state by state. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>

disability includes a condition attributable to--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

(a)	a physical, intellectual, hearing, vision or speech-language impairment, or a developmental delay; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

(b)	an autistic spectrum disorder; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1197517"></A>
(c)	a combination of impairments mentioned in paragraph (a), a developmental delay or an autistic spectrum disorder.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1197518"></A>
There are many instances where families have a child and their disability is actually recognised and diagnosed, but in the scheme of things some families find it difficult to confront a disability in the family. I heard the minister mention diagnosed and not diagnosed incidents issues. I wonder how much consideration will be given to those family circumstances where the child may have an obvious behavioural, intellectual, emotional or physical disability but the family has not had the--fortitude is the word that I would use but I use it advisedly--fortitude or the courage to acknowledge that disability and have it diagnosed. Will that child, whose family may not perhaps have been confident enough to confront the issues in their child, be able to receive the necessary supports irrespective of whether the disability has been specifically and clinically diagnosed? </Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Firstly, I would say that every teacher in every classroom and every principal of every school endeavours to ensure that the educational experience that each child has is appropriate to the needs of that child in that classroom and in that school no matter what their circumstances, personal or otherwise. There are a full range of programs that teachers and principals access to assist in providing that educational experience that each child needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1254902"></A>
Secondly, I would say that it would be my hope that the response and recognition trial would be a vehicle for identifying the educational needs of those students and perhaps bypassing the challenge that some parents may understandably find it difficult to meet, and that is dealing overtly with the issue of whether or not their child exhibits or is diagnosed as having a particular disability. The response and recognition trial is preoccupied with the issue of what are the educational needs of the particular child dependant upon whatever might be their intellectual or physical circumstances but not contingent upon a particularly prescribed medical diagnosis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1197520"></A>
I would be hopeful that the circumstance that you identify, which no doubt occurs from time to time, is one that could be more compassionately managed by this response and recognition trial being successful in identifying potentially a new way forward for addressing the educational needs of particularly students who presently are more conventionally described as exhibiting a particular disability that is medically identified and assessed and provided to the school. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.46 pm): Clause 11 deals with the exclusion of students by principals. It states a whole raft of legislation that indicates how a principal should go about excluding a student. I do not think any principal would take the decision to expel a student lightly. Expulsion for some students would be like water off a duck’s back but for other students it would be quite a traumatic experience. I understand that this clause is virtually the heart of this legislation. It would equip state school principals with powers to expel students at their discretion without the red tape they currently face. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1197525"></A>
I was hoping that the minister might be able to quickly compare the old system with the new system and just give practical examples of what red tape is excluded and done away with. Of course every student should have the right to go to a safe schooling environment undisrupted and the teachers and principals themselves have a right to a safe working environment and should not have to put up with disruptive or sometimes dangerous student behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1197526"></A>
It brings to mind a couple of questions. Now that it is easier to expel students on the principal’s behalf, first of all do students in state schools run by the Queensland government have to sign up to a code of conduct so that they know upfront what sort of behaviour is expected of them? I know that some private schools have that sort of paperwork. You take your children along and are told, ‘Here is how we expect you to behave and if you break these codes of behaviour you will be excluded.’ If there are those codes of conduct, are they uniform for the state or are they flexible and on a school-by-school basis and is that code of conduct then decided on by principals and the P&amp;C? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1197527"></A>
As we go through clause 11, and it is quite a large clause with a number of pages, 288D, ‘Continuing education during suspension’, states that if the principal suspends the student from the school under section 288C, the principal must arrange for the student’s access to an educational program that allows students to continue with their education during the suspension.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204274"></A>
That of course begs the question: where will the children go once they are suspended? I am sure that the department has thought about this. I know that there are programs in the Wide Bay-Burnett where children who are suspended do go. But unfortunately some students end up on the street and not in proper programs. I was hoping that the minister might be able to expand a little bit on the plans for dealing with those students who have been suspended and especially in rural and regional areas. There are more facilities in capital cities available for those students who are suspended or expelled, but in rural and regional areas there are limited resources, especially for the principals and the parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1254196"></A>
I would like to find out whether the minister has actually set aside extra funding for those suspended students for their welfare and educational experiences while they are suspended. Is there also special consideration given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children? I have had some wonderful conversations with Dr Chris Sarra, and I was wondering whether the minister can expand on that as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204280"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Clause 11, as the member for Burnett has said, is probably the critical clause in this bill. I have some strong concerns in relation to this. We all agree that it is a step in the right direction for these principals to have the power of suspension and expulsion. But I think we would all equally agree that suspending or expelling kids from school does not solve the problems with those kids. The suspended ones return to school and the excluded ones have to find some other place to get their education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204281"></A>
Section 288D in clause 11 provides a responsibility for the principal to arrange for the continuation of a student’s education once they are suspended and further on there are some implications for resumption. It would be no secret to the minister that I think the government has done a very poor job on the programs that look after kids who are suspended or expelled. I have raised this issue many times in this place. I travelled myself to the Fraser Coast to look at the GAP program there, which is a state funded program under the Flexible Learning Program, which had its funding cut in the last state budget. Another program on the Fraser Coast was the Triple S program, which was specially targeted at children who had been excluded from state schools. It was federally funded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204287"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wilson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 So don’t criticise this government. It was federally funded and you wouldn’t admit that during estimates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204288"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Minister, it is not a case of criticising anybody. This is a very serious issue because when you suspend or expel children the problem does not stop there. Those children are part of society: they return to school or they become statistics in the criminal justice system. In common with every parent in Queensland, I do not care whether the state government or the federal government funds them, but someone has to put the programs in place for these children. Triple S, which was federally funded, was working well on the Fraser Coast and the federal government cut the funding. That is certainly not a criticism of the state government, but that program was dealing with students who had been suspended from your state schools, and I would like to have seen the state government either pick up that program or ensure that adequate programs were in place. I have no doubt that in this state we do not have anything like the programs that we need for children who are suspended or excluded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204291"></A>
In my speech on the second reading, I read out the numbers of short and long suspensions and exclusions, and they are going through the roof. We have thousands of kids, tens of thousands of kids, being given short suspensions and many, many kids--an increasing number--being given long suspensions or excluded from schools. They are out on the streets. They are in the shopping centres. They are providing a problem to the community. They are providing a problem to the police. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204292"></A>
I undertook a study of disengaged youth. I studied a whole range of strategies that were being used on the Fraser Coast in particular because I think some of their programs were fabulous. The GAP program, for example, was staffed by very experienced teachers from the Urangan State High School. It was a fabulous program and it was a travesty to see it closed. The Glendyne school in the same area deals with 103 disengaged youths, many of whom have been involved with the juvenile justice system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204295"></A>
This is a really significant growing problem. I support wholeheartedly the principals having this power, but if we leave it at that and we do not acknowledge that the numbers are going through the roof and that the programs simply do not exist to re-engage these kids, to give them a good education and to make them positive contributors to society, it is going to be nothing other than a short-term response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204296"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable members for their contributions. I will take the last contribution first. This Labor government in the last five years, more than any other government in the last 20 years, including the Liberals and the Nationals when they were in government, takes absolutely seriously the issue of ensuring the maximum engagement of each and every student in the opportunity for learning every day in every school. That is why this government and its predecessor--and this Premier when she was education minister--brought in the Education and Training Reforms for the Future that brought trade training into schools and, with Matt Foley as employment and training minister, brought in youth support coordinators to address the issue that the member for Woodridge raised that in 2005 there were quite a number of young people between the ages of 15 and 17 who were out of school, out of work and out of training. So these youth support coordinators, of which there are 113 this very moment, funded by $10 million between Minister Struthers’ department and mine, work with those young people in that compulsory phase of schooling to keep them, as best as they can, engaged in the schooling experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204297"></A>
On top of that, we have over 330 specialist teachers engaged in addressing the challenges of students with significant behaviour management issues at risk of disengaging from schools. We have over 100 alternative education programs that are able to be deployed by teachers generally in the state school system in addition to the more than 330 specialist teachers focusing on maximising the engagement of students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204298"></A>
We have 15 positive learning centres throughout the state, and we are funding the Edmund Rice bridge program at Morayfield, Townsville and Mount Isa, and we will continue to do so. Unlike the Liberals and the Nationals when they were in government, we are spending more money than they ever did, and paying more regard than they ever did, on the effort of ensuring that not only do students in the classroom setting and their parents have access to an uninterrupted learning and teaching environment but that those students who, for whatever good or bad reason, are not able to engage in the learning opportunity in the classroom setting and perform with and exhibit that high level of appropriate behaviour in that setting also have the opportunity to have access to a world-class education. We have done more than anyone else. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204330"></A>
That is not to say that there is not a lot more that should be done. We will continue on the path of doing that because we are committed to those students who for whatever reason--and oftentimes through circumstances over which they have very little control--find themselves in a position where they cannot engage like we would like them to be able to engage in a conventional mainstream educational experience. We want them to have the best opportunity in learning and life.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204333"></A>
If you are going to take a position of exhorting us to be concerned about this cohort of students, it is also incumbent upon you to ensure that your public discourse about this important issue is well and truly balanced and does not distort what is taking place and does not exaggerate or underplay the significance of this issue. Every student who is excluded is a student one too many. In 2009-10, regrettably 775 students were excluded from an individual state school experience--that is, not from the state school system as a whole. I trust that the statistics given to me compute accurately, but I am advised that there are 485,000 students in the state school system and about 1.5 per cent of those have been excluded. We welcome you joining with us in our concern about those students, but we welcome it if you do so on the basis of ensuring that what you say about this problem does not exaggerate or underplay the extent of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204334"></A>
In relation to the student disciplinary absence data that we release every six months, I understand the Liberals and the Nationals did not even publish that at all when you were in government. </Hansard-Body>

 I note that the shadow spokesperson for education would not allow himself to speak in such a way, so I recognise him for the difference he has displayed in his contribution to this debate. I welcome his support of our concern to ensure that all students are engaged in an appropriate opportunity for their educational experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204343"></A>
The member for Burnett raised four questions. The fourth was in relation to the third and it related to Indigenous students. The third was about the opportunities for alternative education for students who had been excluded. I refer him to the remarks I have just made. In relation to the first two questions he asked, I refer him to my closing submissions--and, unfortunately, he was not here when I made them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204344"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think the minister has replied in sufficient detail and in a way that is a little bit accommodating at this time of night. I have simply asked some questions that I would hope he would answer in a very gracious manner, but he has answered them in a less than gracious manner. I simply asked the minister--and I will ask it again through you, Mr Deputy Speaker--whether students and parents have to sign up to a code of conduct. It is a fairly simple question. Is that code of conduct for all students state-wide or are their varying codes of conduct? If the minister puts forward the argument that he cares for the children, he can at least honour the people of Burnett and answer it in a fulsome way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204346"></A>
I note that the minister was quite proud of some of the information he told us, and he probably has some reason to be proud of the 330 teachers on the special learning programs for the disengaged people, the 100 alternative education services, the 15 positive learning services and the Edmund Rice learning centres in all of those different areas. I appreciate that they are quite impressive statistics, as is the boast that this government is spending the most amount of money on education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204347"></A>
However, I would also like to remind the minister of a frightening statistic for Queensland which I have only recently thought about in a critical way--the fact that Queensland has the highest youth suicide rate in Australia. Part of the risk of suspending students, as I mentioned in my first contribution on clause 11, is that for some students a suspension might be like water off a duck’s back but for other students a suspension is quite a traumatic event.  Queensland has the highest youth suicide rate in the whole of Australia--and indeed Australia has one of the highest youth suicide rates compared to the OECD countries--and I would suggest that the minister should think about that statistic and become a little bit more humble in the way he approaches the debate tonight and show a little bit more humility when he answers the questions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204349"></A>
Members on the crossbenches and on the other side of the House are simply trying to ask for some detail. When the minister arrogantly lectures those on this side, it does nothing to improve how this government is seen in the eyes of the community--that is, that it has become a very arrogant, out-of-touch government. I would appreciate it if the minister would inform this place and in doing so inform the people of the Burnett whom I represent about some of the issues that I am asking about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204351"></A>
I would like to know whether the minister consulted with Dr Chris Sarra in constructing this legislation. The minister still has not answered the question about how his policy and this legislation will deal with the suspension of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Dr Chris Sarra was Queenslander of the Year. He heads a special institute now, the Stronger Smarter Institute. He has a wealth of knowledge and he achieved miracles when he was the principal at Cherbourg State School. Could the minister please inform this place of some of the details that I have asked for? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204354"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I refer the honourable member to my remarks in my closing speech, which the opposition shadow spokesperson was good enough to be here to listen to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204355"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There is no area of my portfolio of education that I am more passionate about than the issues surrounding disengaged youth and youth at risk of disengagement. I say that with the utmost respect. I hope I should not take the minister’s comments as suggesting that I am exaggerating the problem, because I can assure him I am not. There are 60,000 short suspensions a year in Queensland. I do not need to exaggerate the problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211152"></A>
Those figures indicate the magnitude of the issue that we are dealing with. I fully appreciate and am very supportive of the programs that the minister has raised. Many of them, however, equate to support in schools. We are talking here about kids who have been separated from school for a short or a longer time. Trade training centres obviously play a significant role, particularly for boys, as well as youth support coordinators. One that the minister left out is school chaplains, who I think make an enormously valuable contribution in supporting our young people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211155"></A>
The minister was very correct in one comment he made and that was that many of these students who are excluded from school or have a lengthy suspension have very little control. Many of them are victims of circumstance themselves. I have taken the trouble to have a look at these issues in this state firsthand. Many of them come from very dysfunctional backgrounds. They might come from parents who suffer substance abuse, who live itinerant lifestyles, who are sometimes victims of abuse and who are frequently victims of neglect. There is a whole--I would be reluctant to use the word ‘class’--cohort of people, particularly in certain parts of the state--and I do not want to single out particular ones, but most of us would be aware where these problems are most acute.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211157"></A>
The comment I made that I would really like to reinforce--and I hope that the minister will take this on board tonight because I have looked at it very seriously--is the need for a program specifically aimed at the disengaged youth. I did name a number from the Fraser Coast and there are other examples around the state. I have no doubt that they are by no means adequate, numerous or widespread enough across the state to cope with this very dramatic increase in the number of young people who are disengaged. That number of 775 exclusions would in the main be disengaged youth, and many others would also be at risk of disengagement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211158"></A>
It is a big challenge for us. From the LNP’s point of view, we would be more than happy to work with the government if anything constructive can be achieved. As the minister knows, I raise these issues pretty frequently. I have raised GAP, SSS and flexible learning funding on numerous occasions. I am very concerned that here we are giving principals powers that they should have already. We know that these numbers are going through the roof. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The numbers speak for themselves and I did mention them in my second reading contribution. Putting in place programs to deal with these young people to get them back on track, to get them back into vocational training or education, will be among some of the most important things a government does in this state. It is not just the future of those individuals, their education and whether or not they are able to participate in society and obtain a job that is at stake; it is also that of their partners, their children, their families and the community in which they live. For every child we turn around who is disengaged with education, we make an enormous difference to the people around them for decades to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211165"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let us agree on at least one thing, that we are in heated agreement about our respective concerns for this particular cohort of students, and that is a good thing. I am particularly keen to ensure that we address the description of the size or extent of the issue that we are in heated agreement about as best we can and that it is done in as fully rounded a way as possible. If you look only at the total number of suspensions--and I stand to be corrected--which was 63,000, taking that figure, it is a very big figure. But then there is a number of other dimensions that need to be examined to see the full or the appropriate extent of the issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211166"></A>
There are 485,000 students attending state schools every day. I am advised that on any one day there are, on average, about 288 to 290 students who are the subject of a suspension, short or long. I rely upon professionally trained statisticians to provide me with this material; I am not such a person. That is what I am advised, and I am not seeking to minimise the challenge we face here by reciting these figures. I seek to have a fully rounded appreciation of its size. This amounts to approximately 0.04 per cent. That is 0.04 per cent too much from my point of view. Nonetheless, that is the figure. We will leave it to someone else to double-check the statistics. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211167"></A>
I will give you a further statistic to give a sense of the proportion of the issue. Of all of the students who are suspended, 60 per cent are suspended for three days or fewer. Of the suspensions, 86 per cent are for five days or fewer. The member would be aware that the categories are one to five days and then six to 20. So 86 per cent of suspensions are in that short suspension period of one to five days. When we look then at the number of students, 60 per cent of the students are suspended for three days or fewer. We can look at it in terms of the number of suspensions and the number of students. We need to look at all of the figures to get a fully rounded position. At the end of the day, it is a serious problem, no matter its size. We as a government are very focused on addressing it. I welcome the member’s earlier comments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211168"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I seek a couple of clarifications. Exclusion is a serious matter. I acknowledge the minister’s comments that, given the number of students at state schools in this state, the students who are excluded for one to five days, six to 20 days, permanently or less than one year is a small percentage, and I acknowledge that. The schoolteachers in our state do a brilliant job of handling a very wide cross-section of behaviours, both acquiescent and challenging behaviours. It would be only fair to put on the record that teachers do a brilliant job of managing a broad range of individual children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211170"></A>
Clause 11, in part, states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1211172"></A>
(3)	The notice proposing exclusion must state each of the following--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1211173"></A>
(a)	the principal proposes to exclude the student from the school for a stated period of not more than 1 year or permanently;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1211174"></A>
That statement is repeated on a couple of occasions. I am taking it that the exclusion period that is being dealt with in this clause--and I did not have a chance to clarify it during the second reading debate--is less than a year or permanent. They are two fairly contradictory periods. So it deals with an exclusion of less than one year or a permanent exclusion. I would just like that clarified. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211175"></A>
The minister talked about programs at Morayfield, Townsville and Mount Isa, which are all in Labor electorates--and that is good. However, I wonder what programs are available in the rest of the state for students who are excluded given that the adopted principle in this state is learn or earn. What programs are going to be available for students who are excluded, whether it is for less than a year or permanently? What will be available to them? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218275"></A>
I know that the resources in my electorate are pressed at times for children with challenging behaviours who have been excluded for a protracted period of time. When this legislation passes, what additional resources will be made available to schools in rural and regional Queensland where students are excluded, albeit for very bad behaviours--again, I am not saying that bad behaviour should be condoned; it should not be. If teachers and principals are finding students too difficult to manage then they should have this as an alternative. </Hansard-Body>

 Can I just correct the record. I should have said when responding to the shadow spokesperson earlier that an average of 188 or 190 students are suspended on any one day out of 485. Apparently I may have said 288. I did mean to say 188 or 190 on average. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218277"></A>
I come to the member for Gladstone’s comments. We have been responding to joint venture opportunities that we have identified with the Edmund Rice Foundation, a very significant educational institution associated with the Catholic Church in Queensland and unrelated to whatever electoral district in which it might be found in Queensland. The Catholic Church has not had the habit of arranging its activities according to electoral boundaries in Queensland to my knowledge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218278"></A>
In relation to the issue that the member raised about the opportunities available for disengaged students, with respect I did outline earlier in my response to the shadow spokesperson a whole range of opportunities. Sure, we would like there to be more, just as I would like there to be 0.00 students excluded or suspended. I did outline those to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218279"></A>
Finally the member asked questions about the exclusion being up to a year or permanently. I want the House to understand that that is already the position. What is changing is that the decision maker in relation to an exclusion is not the principal’s supervisor but the principal. The same framework of decision making applies after this bill is passed as before. It is the locus of the power that is relocating to the principal, down from the principal’s supervisors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218281"></A>
We can draw some confidence from the fact that the extent of the exclusion time frame--up to a year or permanently--is presently what has been operating for some number of years in the hands of principals’ supervisors. That, I believe from experience, has been managed responsibly. However, we are relocating to the principal from the principal’s supervisor the express power of making that decision. We would expect that it would be exercised with no less level of responsibility and discretion than has historically been displayed by the principal’s supervisor. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.24 pm): I listened to the minister’s reply to my contribution in the debate on the bill. In particular, I seek clarification of clause 24 which states, ‘This part amends the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000’. In the explanatory notes on page 7 under ‘Administrative costs’ it states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1218286"></A>
Implementation of the Bill is not expected to result in any additional administrative costs to the Government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218287"></A>
What about the administrative costs to small training organisations? There is nothing that recognises and acknowledges the bureaucratic red tape that this bill is proposing to require small training organisations to comply with. Why have we not got in this explanatory note acknowledgement or comment on the possible implications of those proposed changes on small training organisations? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218288"></A>
Why is it that the department does not want to hear the concerns that the small training organisations in Queensland have? I am aware of the discussions the department is having on the national scheme legislation. It seems to me that, quite frankly, this government is going down the road of creating more bureaucracy, more red tape which I believe is totally unnecessary and at a time when Queenslanders are calling out for a reduction in red tape, a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218289"></A>
I have a list of questions here that small training organisations which provide, say, a course for two hours to train people in first aid or CPR will have to answer. These are the questions that under this bill the government is proposing small training organisations will have to comply with and the questions that students will have to complete. I think it is bureaucracy gone mad. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218291"></A>
Minister, I do not believe your department is properly informing you of the possible implications that this will have on small training organisations. I will read some of the questions that a small training organisation is going to be required to answer. We are talking about a training organisation that is going to run a course for two hours and receives no state or federal funding. It is not a university, it is not a technical college, but a small business running a course for two hours. Under this proposal they are going to be required to complete these questionnaires. The students are going to be required to complete a questionnaire. I understand that the students say that they are a jolly waste of time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218292"></A>
Who is requiring this to happen? It is your senior departmental staff meeting with their colleagues and the federal government who, quite frankly, I believe have no understanding of the possible implications of what you are proposing here tonight, and that is going to affect our small businesses which are creating jobs in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Please tell us about the training provided by the organisation that sent you this questionnaire. Your feedback will play an important role in developing the quality of training at this organisation. In this questionnaire the term ‘training’ refers to learning experiences provided by the training organisation. The term ‘trainer’ refers to trainers, teachers, lecturers or instructors. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1218303"></A>
There are questions about the employer’s training. Were the trainers effective in their teaching? Did the trainers have a good knowledge and experience of the industry? Were the trainers able to relate material to the workplace? Overall were they satisfied with the training? It goes on and on and on. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The issues that the member has raised are separate from what is provided for in this amendment bill. This amendment bill goes nowhere near the issues that the member has raised.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. Minister, is it the case that as a result of this proposed bill being passed by this House regulations will be introduced? Will there be explanatory notes introduced with those supporting regulations so that members of this parliament--be they government, opposition or crossbenches--will clearly understand the possible implications of those regulations? My understanding at the moment is that the only way we can question that is when that document is tabled in here and we have to move a disallowance motion and then, not knowing what is contained in that regulation, we have to have a debate in this parliament that will last for up to two hours simply because the government has not introduced an explanatory note to go with those regulations.</Hansard-Body>

Clause 25 inserts ‘skill set’ as a new definition in section 19. Skill set is defined as a unit of competency, or a combination of units of competency, that links to a licensing or regulatory requirement or a particular industry need.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1218361"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This definition is recognising that we are dealing with a competency based training system. Not only is that competency based training system one that allows accreditation and qualification when an apprentice or a trainee acquires a sufficient level of skills to be accorded a certificate I or a certificate II or a certificate III or indeed a certificate IV level of qualification; more than that, what this definition is now going to permit under the Queensland legislation is that any worker who acquires in a training program a number of skills that are less than the number of skills required to be given or accredited with a certificate I, II or whatever it might be, that number of skills is recognised as a skill set. That can then be relied upon by that worker in that, at whatever later time they wish to resume their training, they have a recognition that that set of skills--short of the full package that might be needed for the purpose of being accorded the certificate I, II or III qualification--is nonetheless a recognised set of skills and therefore can be built upon by further training such that they then can ultimately reach the point of being accredited for the complete set of skills available for a recognised level of qualification such as certificate I, II, III, IV or indeed diploma level. That is to the worker’s benefit and indeed to the employer’s benefit, because the worker can turn up with, in a sense, a certificate attainment saying that out of a package of 20 skills needed for certificate I they have received training for 15 of that 20.</Hansard-Body>

So it is described by its function rather than its name, and its function is a register of vocational education and training matters.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (10.38 pm): I rise to speak in order to support the crime prevention strategy of Neighbourhood Watch. The Neighbourhood Watch program was developed in order to bring the police and the community closer together after the realisation that police needed to work more closely with the community in preventing and solving crime. Neighbourhood Watch had its roots in the United States in the early 1960s. In June 1988 Neighbourhood Watch was launched in Queensland. Neighbourhood Watch focuses on improving home security, reducing the fear of crime and reporting suspicious activities to police. The evolution of Neighbourhood Watch has seen groups become involved in broader community safety issues and working to identify and address local problems that may not necessarily involve crime.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232714"></A>
It is my understanding that currently there are about 31 Neighbourhood Watch districts throughout Queensland. The program and associated Neighbourhood Watch groups are well supported by the Queensland police, with officers attending the group meetings. Neighbourhood Watch enhances cohesion within the local community and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the program can actually help in improving relationships between neighbours. Traditionally, Neighbourhood Watch has had a very strong and committed volunteer base and has a symbol that is recognised worldwide by potential victims and offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225599"></A>
Sadly though, there is some evidence to suggest that the community spirit around Neighbourhood Watch may be waning slightly. Certainly, on the Sunshine Coast a few of the local Neighbourhood Watch groups are fighting for survival. One group has been operating for almost 20 years, but is one of many Neighbourhood Watch groups across the region that is now struggling to maintain numbers. One in particular has had its numbers fall to about 30 from almost 800 residents in the area. The coordinator of this particular group is predicting that crime will increase if Neighbourhood Watch groups like his begin to close down owing to lack of support. It seems that the basic guidelines of the Neighbourhood Watch, which require a simple telephone tree of neighbours’ contact numbers, are now almost nonexistent, with most people no longer knowing their neighbours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225600"></A>
It would be an utter tragedy if this once robust and highly successful community program were to fail. I encourage all members of this House and the community to promote and, if possible, become involved in their local Neighbourhood Watch program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225602"></A>
I would like to pay tribute to a gentleman in my area by the name of Mr Mel Fletcher, who was a member of the Kuluin Neighbourhood Watch. He passed away on Tuesday night. To his wife, Dawn, and to their family, I pay the greatest respect and I hope that this parliament would pay that to him as well. He was a wonderful man. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.41 pm): I rise to celebrate 75 years of the Brothers Juniors Rugby League Football Club, which is based in my electorate at Gibson Park, Stafford. The proud traditions of the Brethren started in 1935 and while the senior club wound up a number of years ago, the blue and white butcher striped jersey has been carried on by Brisbane Brothers Juniors. The year 2010 has been a wonderful year of successes on and off the field. Brothers’ 530 registered players formed 26 junior teams and two senior teams--all supported by a legion of loyal supporters including coaches, managers, trainers, family and other assorted volunteering Brothers’ faithful. Eight sides contested grand finals and three won premierships. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225609"></A>
It is my very great honour to be the patron of Brothers Juniors and I was very pleased to join this family club at a number of great events where this 75th anniversary year was celebrated. In June, I was joined by my colleague the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport, himself a Brothers stalwart--</Hansard-Body>

Mr HINCHLIFFE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. At the club’s 75th anniversary dinner we heard from great names of the club over the decades, including a recorded interview with 93-year-old Neil Murdoch, who played in the butcher stripes against Norths in the 1940 A-grade grand final. Sadly, Mr Murdoch has since passed on, but it was a pleasure to support the presentation of a special anniversary Brothers jersey No. 4, recognising Neil’s position as a centre in the 1940 side, to the Murdoch family at his funeral. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225614"></A>
Past President Scott Munro’s presentation on the club’s history was most poignant, given the Munro family’s involvement with the club over many decades. Alongside his fellow life member father, Don, Scott has served the club tirelessly. I know how proud he is of his sons Daniel and Ben, the seniors and juniors club captains respectively.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1225618"></A>

The trophy day, as with the anniversary dinner, was ably presided over by President Roger Whyte, who was buoyed by the enthusiasm of the more than 800 attendees to celebrate the season with all the players and their supporters. This has been a tremendous year for the Brethren, but it would not have been possible without the loyal army of volunteers supporting the 28 teams, running the canteen and preparing the grounds at Gibson Park or, indeed, the many generous sponsors of the club. It would not be possible to mention all these volunteers, but I will highlight Roger Whyte’s hardworking committee: the efforts of long-time and tireless secretary, Graham Brennan--better known as Bruno--and vice-president cum canteen manager Mario Licastro and other committee members and general helpers around the club, including Peter Gill, John Pezzimenti, Charles Larosa, Debbie Hiscock, Paul McSween, Damian Smith, Andrew Hedger, John Geaney, Patricia Licastro, Jeff Leitch, Michael Lynch, Craig Grauf, Davida Boyd and many more besides.

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (10.44 pm): October is Sexual Violence Awareness Month. The teal ribbon that I am wearing is the symbol for the month and is intended to remind us that we must remain vigilant and we all have a role to play in preventing violence of all sorts and working towards a safer Queensland. During the past month I have attended two candle lighting remembrance ceremonies. At the first of these I was joined by the member for Albert, who was a guest speaker. We both agree that the stories shared with the participants by the brave women who have been victims of sexual violence were horrific but at the same time inspiring because of the way these women are fighting back to regain their lives with the help of the people of the Logan Centre Against Sexual Violence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225645"></A>
The second candle lighting remembrance ceremony was at the Gold Coast Centre Against Sexual Violence in Southport at their brand-new premises that was purpose built to provide the facilities to better help them in their support role. What they need now is certainty of funding beyond 2011 to ensure that their important work can continue. I was joined at that event by the member for Gaven. Once again, the stories that the brave victims of sexual violence shared with us were both horrific but inspiring and a testament to the valuable work that the support staff at the centre do. </Hansard-Body>

 report that was launched in this place just a few weeks ago. Many members attended the launch of that report, which was held in the Undumbi Room. The report proposes an evidence based, holistic response to sexual assault in Queensland. It advocates a system designed to enable Queensland to move towards the reduction and ultimate elimination of sexual violence. It also proposes a service delivery system designed to better address the diverse needs of the Queensland community. I know that the 20 sexual assault services that contributed to the development of that report urge the minister to read the document, to take on board the initiatives that it contains and to respond to them with a view to producing better outcomes for sexual assault victims in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

Another worthwhile and, may I suggest, linked organisation is CEO Challenge. Recently I attended the AGM of CEO Challenge and was pleased to witness the recruitment of two new corporate sponsors who have taken up the challenge to support a local domestic violence refuge. That takes the total of corporate sponsors that are supporting domestic violence refuges around Queensland to 16. The two new sponsors are GHD, a project management firm, and Australia Post. They join the likes of the Brisbane City Council, the Gold Coast City Council, Minter Ellison, Clayton Utz and others. Members may remember CEO Challenge being our guest here to commemorate White Ribbon Day in November last year. At that time members took the oath: ‘I swear not to commit, excuse or be silent about violence against women.’ Should members receive an invitation this year to attend a White Ribbon Day event, I urge them to take the time to attend.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225654"></A>
In closing, members, we should all carry these statistics with us as a reminder: one in three women experience domestic violence in their relationship; domestic violence is the major cause of death for women aged between 15 and 44.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (10.47 pm): On Thursday, 14 October at the Studio Village Community Centre I held a very special ceremony to recognise some wonderful constituents with my inaugural 2010 Albert Carer of the Year Awards. Together with my special guest, the Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Annastacia Palaszczuk, I was privileged to recognise, with trophies and certificates, the hard work and loving dedication of eight wonderful people. No carer ever expects any sort of award or recognition. Caring is a duty that they undertake out of love, compassion and commitment. Yet given how significant their role is in making a real difference in the lives of their loved ones, as the member for Albert, I felt compelled during Carers Week to celebrate their achievements with the inaugural awards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225662"></A>
Often we call caring a full-time job, but after listening to the stories of the award winners I know that this is simply not true. Full-time work is eight hours a day, five days a week and one receives a pay packet at the end of the week. On the other hand, caring is 24 hours a day, seven days a week and, even during rare times of respite, the person in one’s care is never far from the carer’s mind. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225663"></A>
At the awards I recognised three different types of carers: young carers, senior carers and grandparent carers. The recognition of Albert grandparents as carers is particularly timely, with the passing today through this parliament of amendments to the Carers (Recognition) Act. Thanks to the commitment of the Labor government and Minister Annastacia Palaszczuk, the amendments will extend the coverage of the Carers (Recognition) Act 2008 to grandparents who are the full-time carers for their grandchildren. The amendments mean that Queensland will become the first state in Australia to legislatively recognise the tireless work of our state’s grandparents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1225667"></A>
At the event I was particularly pleased to thank Maree Lubach founder of KinKare, Carers Queensland, and MAD--Mothers Against Drugs--for their significant contribution to the success of the awards by nominating worthy recipients.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232863"></A>
It was clear to me at the event that there is one thing common to all carers. That one thing is the great love and generous heart which brings them to do what they do. To the carers Jazzmyn Pybus, Andrew Pearce, Cindy Hancock, Sharon Kelly, Marie Currie, Robert and Jacqueline Morris and Nora Lleuful: I say thank you for your tireless dedication to those you care for. Through your selfless love you provide important role models to me and the rest of the community. You are most worthy winners of the inaugural 2010 Albert Carer of the Year Awards. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Beaudesert--TQP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.50 pm): It was fantastic news this morning from the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health in relation to the Beaudesert Hospital. I welcome the announcement that the government will make a commitment in terms of enhancing the maternity services for low-risk births at the Beaudesert Hospital. This will no doubt take some pressure off the Logan Hospital as well. I know there have been prenatal and postnatal services since 1 July, but that announcement is extremely welcome. It has been almost 10 years that the community has been fighting long and hard for this and I look forward to a further announcement in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232869"></A>
I also thank the minister for coming out for some 2 hours to meet with the staff. The Beaudesert Hospital auxiliary were thrilled and are now knitting a pair of socks for him which I have to deliver. They were very happy to have the Deputy Premier rock up to see the good work that the Beaudesert Hospital auxiliary does. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232870"></A>
Speaking of maternity wards and children, there has been the controversial issue of the abortion debate in the public arena. I appreciate the Premier has a different position to the legislation that exists in the House. I quite happily put on the public record that I support the existing legislation in regard to abortion and also note that the Premier did say that there was not a majority of support within the chamber to decriminalise abortion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232871"></A>
A new high school in the Beaudesert region is certainly needed. The Beaudesert State High School awards were announced last night. It was a fantastic event. That school is at capacity. Out of the 34 schools in the Beaudesert electorate, the high schools are certainly reaching their capacity. So I would like to see in a five-year plan the possibility of the construction of a new high school. I would like to acknowledge all the teachers across the 34 schools in the Beaudesert electorate. Given it is World Teachers Day tomorrow, I think it is fitting that we all understand the great work that they do to make sure that we educate future generations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232872"></A>
I also want to thank the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning for his visit to the Wyaralong Dam. It was great to see him out there with the members for Logan, Ipswich West, Redcliffe, Morayfield, Bulimba and the deputy mayor for the Scenic Rim Regional Council to see how the trail bike facility is coming along. Thank you very much for the good work that is happening there and the local employment that the Wyaralong Dam and the trail bike facility will be generating in that region. It is a very welcome addition to the area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232873"></A>
Turning to the Tamborine Mountain urban and rural firefighters, I have raised with the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services that they are in dire need of a shower and toilet facility. I would be pushing for both of those services to move together next to the ambulance station on Mount Tamborine and next to the helipad so that they can share those services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232874"></A>
I also thank the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading and the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability for their announcement tomorrow in relation to expressions of interest for investors to develop and operate semi-permanent, low-impact ecotourism accommodation at Green Mountain campground in Lamington National Park. I look forward to ecotourism to boost the tourism industry in the Beaudesert region. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Marine Stinger Awareness Week</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.51 pm): The week of 6 to 12 November is an important week in North Queensland because it is Marine Stinger Awareness Week. What are marine stingers? They are basically jellyfish. While there are many stinging jellyfish in the world, there are two main types that are of concern in North Queensland. The first of these is the irukandji which, contrary to popular myth, is not a newly discovered jellyfish. It is actually named after the Irukandji Aboriginal tribe from the hinterland of Cairns who knew something about the syndrome that people developed after swimming in the ocean off Cairns. We know of at least 10 species of irukandji and one thing they all have in common is that they are quite small, between 1 and 2 centimetres across the bell. They are not of themselves lethal, although people with underlying pulminary or respiratory conditions are at greater risk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232879"></A>
The other type of jellyfish of concern is the box jellyfish, or the chironex fleckeri. It is the most lethal marine creature in the world. It can kill an adult in just two to three minutes with just a five-centimetre piece of its tentacle contacting the skin. There have been at least 63 deaths in Australian tropical waters between 1884 and 1996. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232880"></A>
The point of Marine Stinger Awareness Week is to raise awareness in the community and especially amongst our local children with visits to schools to give information and education to these children so that they are alert but not alarmed. They do not need to be alarmed because, just like we have learned to live with mosquitoes that sometimes carry dengue fever in the natural environment in North Queensland, so we have to learn to live with these creatures of the sea because they are a natural part of the environment. We need to learn to manage them, not to fear them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232881"></A>
I have been fortunate to attend several meetings of the Whitsunday Marine Stingers Management Committee. I applaud the role and the participation of all the members including the Whitsunday Regional Council, Surf Life Saving Queensland, Tourism Whitsunday, the Whitsunday Charter Boat Industry Association, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and local marine operators. I have been given a task by them to work with ministers of this government to establish a protocol for the reporting of sting incidents in the Whitsundays and more broadly in the state. This is about compiling data that will help us to learn more because so little is known about these creatures so that we may be able to better manage these stings. Knowing more means less fear. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (10.54 pm): I rise to update the House about the senseless and wanton destruction of the Cleveland Ambulance Station in the very early hours of Wednesday, 27 October. The ambulance station in Wellington Street, Cleveland, was set alight and the fire burned out the entire building, causing major structural damage and destroying everything within the building. Police and fire officers quickly attended the blaze, but despite their valiant efforts the building could not be saved. I want to acknowledge the good work on site of our local police, fire and SES personnel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232885"></A>
In addition to the damage to the building, an ambulance vehicle was stolen and set on fire, two others were burned inside the building, along with at least six defibrillators, other equipment, training implements and personal belongings of ambulance officers. I am able to report that a 23-year-old woman from Wellington Point was arrested and charged last night with arson, break and enter and unlawful use of a motor vehicle, among other charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232886"></A>
The damage is so extensive that the early assessment by fire officers is that the building will likely have to be demolished and rebuilt. The early estimate of the replacement cost of the station is in the range of $4 million, plus three new ambulances and all other equipment. The cost of the arson attack goes beyond the material damage to the station, vehicles and equipment. The ambulance officers based at the station are doing it tough. The place where they live, call home and work from is now gone. It has been an emotional time for them and their families. I want to commend the ambulance officers of the Cleveland station for their service to the community and for their steadfastness under extreme pressure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232887"></A>
I want to also acknowledge the Queensland Ambulance Service for its quick response that insured minimal disruption to services. I note that a temporary operation centre has been set up at the Cleveland SES until an interim centre can be established and then the station fully rebuilt. I want to particularly acknowledge the following individuals: QAS Area Director Steve Clarke, Cleveland OIC Jamie Smith, the LAC leadership team led by Neville Coventry and Robyn Tennant. Can I also acknowledge the role of both the minister, Neil Roberts, and shadow minister, Ted Malone, for their swift and meaningful response. I appreciate the minister’s immediate commitment to the Cleveland community to rebuild the station to its former operational capacity, including all vehicles and equipment. I agree with the shadow minister that a review of security and surveillance at all ambulance stations should be undertaken to prevent further incidents from occurring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232888"></A>
I offer tonight to the minister and government all the resources of my office to assist them wherever possible in the rebuilding of the station in the shortest time possible. As a patron of the Cleveland Local Ambulance Committee, I also look forward to working with the team to do everything possible to support our officers and the service.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.57 pm): On Monday night this week I had the pleasure of representing the Minister for Community Services and Housing, Karen Struthers, at the Older People Speak Out Media Awards at the Queensland State Library. It was a fantastic night. In attendance on the night were Val French, President of OPSO, the wonderful Noeline Brown, Australia’s Ambassador for Ageing, and Rosemary Menkens, member for Burdekin. These awards, which are just one of a number of key initiatives of OPSO, are an opportunity to recognise media professionals who portray older people accurately, fairly and positively, and help to break down negative stereotypes in the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1232892"></A>
I know that in my own electorate of Townsville we have a very vocal and active senior community who never miss an opportunity to talk with me about their needs and wants and who always bring to the table both practical suggestions and the broader vision that is required to promote a positive image of older people in our community. It is the media that plays an important role in raising community awareness of those needs and in creating an age-friendly Queensland. By partnering with our local media networks, older people can get this important message across to the broader community and ensure that older people are not taken for granted, are shown respect and are not ignored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240145"></A>
Having said that, I could not have been more pleased to see no less than four of this year’s OPSO awards go to the Townsville and Burdekin region. The <Hansard-Italic>
Townsville Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
’s prime time journalist Emma Chadwick picked up two awards. The first was the Queensland Award for the Elements Daily Newspapers for her article ‘Older workers share skills’. For the same article, Emma also collected the national special OPSO media award for excellence in the coverage of positive ageing in the workforce for workers aged 50 to 67. The very wonderful Alex Chambers from 630 ABC North Queensland was the winner of the Queensland Award for Radio News, Interviews and Current Affairs for his entry ‘Good old talk--Facebook for the over-60s’. Finally, but certainly not least, Robert Lesca from the Burdekin Community Association won the Queensland Award for Seniors Newsletters--Presentation and Content for their new newsletter <Hansard-Italic>
Round-a-bout for Seniors</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240159"></A>
I would like to congratulate Emma, Alex and Robert for the work that you do to accurately portray older people as active and valued members of our society. It is your efforts that will continue to improve the way seniors are perceived throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1240160"></A>
In closing, I wish all Townsville grandparents a happy Grandparents Day for Sunday, 7 November. I encourage everyone to take the time to make a phone call, have a picnic with or send a card to their grandparents and tell them how much they love and value having them in their lives. On behalf of my children, Ethan and Paige, can I send a special wish to their grandparents: Grandma June, and Grandpa Phil Johnstone in Ayr and their Grandad Terry and Nana Val Thompson in Townsville. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (11.00 pm): It gives me pleasure to rise this evening and announce to the House what is a coup for all prep students and their families in the Kawana electorate. We have previously debated in this House the importance of pool safety regulations, with specific reference to pool fencing. But tonight I would like to address the House on a different aspect of pool safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240170"></A>
I am sure that all members would have heard of the legendary Australian swimming identity Mr Laurie Lawrence. Honourable members will remember Laurie’s famous reaction at the 1988 Seoul Olympics when Duncan Armstrong famously won the 200-metre freestyle gold medal over the favourite Matt Biondi, in a world record breaking performance. Immediately after the race when asked if he thought Duncan could do it, in a typical fashion, Laurie replied, ‘Mate, why do you think we come here for, for silver ... stuff the silver, we come for the gold.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240173"></A>
Laurie’s passion is still in the pool but is solely focused on educational purposes. He now runs the Laurie Lawrence Swim School in Brisbane, which specialises in teaching people about safety aspects of pool safety. Laurie has pioneered the Kids Alive--Do the Five program and DVD. I am honoured to announce tonight that next month Laurie Lawrence is visiting the Kawana electorate to present a copy of his DVD to all prep students in the electorate. I have the privilege of accompanying Laurie on a tour around the electorate as we visit 661 prep students in the seven primary schools to present them each with a copy of the DVD. That will mean 661 students and their families will have a valuable instructional, interactive and educational DVD on water safety leading into summer and the busy Christmas period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240178"></A>
For all those who are unaware, Kids Alive--Do the Five refers to the following five water safety lessons that are sung with a catchy tune, which I will refrain from doing--</Hansard-Body>

5.	 Learn how to resuscitate </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240185"></A>
Laurie created the Kids Alive--Do the Five water safety program in 1988 to highlight the awareness of the increase in drowning of pre-school-aged children. I am very pleased that Laurie has taken the time out of his busy schedule on 10 November to come to Kawana to continue the promotion of his water safety initiatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240188"></A>
This also follows on from the CPR certification initiatives undertaken by the Talara Primary College for their year 7 students. I was delighted to be able to sponsor the initiative with two local businesses--Swimart Currimundi and Jim’s Mowing Aroona. All year 7 students at the Talara school undertook the course and are now accredited with the CPR certification. I would like to congratulate College Director Steve Adams and Deputy Principal Lisa Johnson for the coordination of this course, as well as the two local businesses which were able to join with me and financially contribute to the funding of the program. This is the second year that I have sponsored the CPR certification and I look forward to a continued involvement in years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240193"></A>
I am looking forward to the 10th when Laurie Lawrence comes to the Kawana electorate. As I said, 661 students will walk away that day with the Kids Alive--Do the Five DVD. I think that is great for the society and for swimming in general.</Hansard-Body>

Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (11.04 pm): Tonight I pay tribute to Mrs Dell Luxton and recognise her contribution in the local community I am honoured to represent. I think Dell would describe herself as an ordinary Queenslander. Dell was a mum and a grandma, a baker and a gardener, a watcher of the <Hansard-Italic>
Bold and the Beautiful</Hansard-Italic>
 and someone who cared about the community around her.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240198"></A>
Dell’s daughter Shelley conveyed to me that she was not sure her mum was important enough to be talked about in the parliament, but I assure you, Shelley, that is not the case. There is no better place than in here, the people’s house, to acknowledge those stoic members of our community who have not only lived through some tough times but have done so with a compassion for their fellow Queenslanders and a preparedness to speak up for their community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240199"></A>
Last week, a few months after her 80th birthday, Dell passed away as a result of a tragic accident, an accident that could never have been foreseen. I have known Dell for a short part of her 80 years. I first spoke to her in 2002 when we were neighbours in Annerley, with Dell living in Waldheim Street and I was living in Bower Street. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240202"></A>
In our local community was an Army Reserve facility that had been identified as surplus to requirements and listed for sale by the Commonwealth. Dell saw this facility and particularly the drill halls as important to the heritage and character of the local community and formed a local community group to develop alternative uses for the site but particularly to ensure recognition of the heritage value. Dell’s campaign to protect this site did not see her vision of a Queensland military heritage museum being developed, but she did succeed in having the two drill halls heritage listed. I know Dell’s vision of the military heritage centre would have been the best outcome for the site, but without her determination to protect as much of the site as possible, much of the local heritage would have been lost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240203"></A>
Following my election in 2004, I continued to see Dell regularly around the community and she kept raising community issues with me. She wrote to me about public liability insurance for not-for-profit organisations; the State Tennis Centre development; access to local railway stations; provision of taxi vouchers; preservation of Yeronga Park; the Community Memorials Restoration Program and other things. Most recently Dell had raised her concerns with me about the Cross River Rail project and the protection of parkland in Stevens Street, Yeronga.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1253883"></A>
Dell regularly attended her local Neighbourhood Watch meetings and always spoke to me about local issues. Just a few days before her accident we talked together about the briefing for the TOD development where Dell raised her concern about ensuring that development included space for local children to play. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1253884"></A>
Dell’s contribution to her community included many years on the P&amp;C at Junction Park State School and as a volunteer reader to children at the school. Earlier this week at the service in celebration of Dell’s life, I heard her grandchildren speak of their life with their granny. What I saw was a group of confident and proud young people who could all talk about how Dell provided guidance and assurance for them in growing up and determining their life plans.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1240211"></A>
Dell was a special person to her family and her community--a loyal and stoic woman who was prepared to speak up for what was right. Dell had an opinion and was not afraid to say it but did so at all times with respect, kindness, warmth and good intentions. Dell was in fact an extraordinary Queenslander, and in her passing I thank her for her passion, spirit and commitment to her community.</Hansard-Body>
