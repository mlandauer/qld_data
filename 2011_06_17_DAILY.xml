 Thank you, Mr Speaker. Secondly, the minister questioned the ethics of taping a conversation involving a Queensland Rail executive and was seeking advice on the matter, implying that the act was illegal. I table a Parliamentary Library study which clearly proves that the recording of any conversation that you are party to is legal, including a phone call where the recording device is not electronically connected to the phone.</Hansard-Body>

 I would ask the honourable member, in accordance with standing order 269, to write to me. The other thing I would say to the honourable member is that I will not have the tape tabled before I get it checked to make sure there is nothing unparliamentary or anything that should not be tabled on it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001337"></A>
The other thing I would say to all sides of the House is this: do not ever stand up and accuse anybody of deliberately misleading the House because you are saying that that person has committed a contempt. If you want to get up and allege a contempt then write to me and I will determine whether it is a contempt. That is what the standing order is about. And I thought I was going to be in for a good day! It is the Sergeant-at-Arms’s birthday. He is 21, although he is celebrating it for about the fourth time!</Hansard-Body>

Honourable members</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001001"></A>
On 9 March 2011, I received correspondence from the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities, relating to statements made by the Member for Redlands during the debate on the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001002"></A>
The Minister alleges that the member failed to declare a pecuniary interest pursuant to Standing Orders 259 and 260 before participating in the debate and voting on the Bill.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001003"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5) I sought a response from the member. The member challenges a number of the Minister’s assertions in his response.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001004"></A>
I do not intend to canvass the details of the claims and counter claims.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001005"></A>
In applying the facts of this matter to SO 260 the first element to consider is whether the donation from the Karreman Quarries Trust to the Redlands SEC constitutes a pecuniary interest.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001006"></A>
I note that all previous examination of the application of SO 260 has tended to relate to private interests held by the member such as real property or business interests. In this case the alleged interest is a donation to a political campaign fund.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001007"></A>
Giving ‘pecuniary interest’ its widest possible meaning it is possible to include donations to a campaign fund.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001008"></A>
But any finding that donations to party campaign funds constitute pecuniary interests to a member under SO 260 has wider implications. It would appear to be almost perverse to include donations to a campaign fund, in the name of a political party, within the ambit of SO 260 whilst at the same time excluding transactions such as those provided as examples in the former Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee paper, tabled 8 June 2005--where the pecuniary interest was actually held by the member.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001009"></A>
The second element of SO 260 is that it must be an interest of which the member is aware. While it is clear that the Member for Redlands is now aware of the donation there is nothing in his submission which indicates that he was personally aware of the donation at the time of the debate. There is in fact no evidence that the member was aware of the donation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001010"></A>
Given that the donation was to the Redlands SEC and there is no evidence of knowledge by the member of the donation, there is insufficient evidence to justify a referral to the committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001011"></A>
Accordingly, I have decided not to refer it to the Ethics Committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

But within that milestone the RSL will commemorate another milestone, as RSL figurehead and stalwart Queensland soldier Doug Formby steps down from the position of state president. Doug Formby is a formidable and compassionate champion for our veteran community, and I take this opportunity on behalf of all Queenslanders to thank him for the valuable role he has played in supporting and assisting RSL members, their families and the wider veteran community during his past five years as president and during his many years active within this great organisation.</A></Hansard-Body>

Doug Formby was born to be a soldier. He is a career soldier who during his distinguished career served with the armies of the USA, Britain, New Zealand and Malaysia. Doug Formby was commissioned into the Australian Army in 1958 as a Second Lieutenant to the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. In the early 1960s he saw active service in Sarawak with a British cavalry regiment during the confrontation with Indonesia. He again saw active service in South Vietnam in 1969-70 with Australian armoured units. He also dedicated himself to a generation of soldiers, instructing at the Royal Military College at Duntroon and the Australian Army Staff College at Queenscliff in Victoria and commanding the Army’s premier training establishment, the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra. I am sure that all members will join me in congratulating and thanking Doug Formby for his long and distinguished career and his dedication to both the armed services and the RSL. I want to personally wish Doug Formby all the best in his future endeavours. </Hansard-Body>

Obviously the Jollys are made of strong and sturdy stock and some members may feel a chill to contemplate the possibility that there is every chance that Spencer, the ever-hungry news hound, will still be wandering the corridors here looking for scoops when he turns 100!

I refer to the announcement on 11 October 2006 when former Premier Beattie awarded Chalco preferred developer status for the Aurukun bauxite project on the basis that an alumina refinery would be built at Gladstone, Bowen or Townsville and the subsequent announcement that a $2.2 billion refinery would be built at Bowen. I ask: will the Premier advise if anyone in the government is currently negotiating with Chalco or any lobbyist acting for Chalco for a major cash payment to the government or for any other condition to let them out of the commitment to build a refinery in Queensland? </A></Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member his question. Members will recall that the government entered into an exclusive mandate with Chalco for a defined period of time. My recollection is that that defined period of time expired last year. That was made public. We did not renew the exclusive mandate and Chalco has no exclusive mandate in relation to the original call for tenders on that project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002771"></A>
What we did say--and I announced also at the time--was that we would continue discussions with Chalco. If they wanted to put an alternative proposition to us, then we would consider it. I am not aware of any alternative proposition being put by Chalco. I understand that they wanted us to consider potentially whether or not they could have another value-adding processing facility to a different mineral--this was last year they put this possibility--but that has not materialised. They have until the end of June for those discussions to terminate, which I think is two weeks away. Should they prove unsuccessful, which at this stage it is likely they will, then we will then consider whether or not to put the Chalco lease back to the international market. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Treasurer. I table a press release from 3 May this year showing where the Northern Territory Labor government announced a Build Bonus scheme to provide $10,000 to purchasers or builders of new homes that will be valid for an eight-month period, demonstrating that the so-called Queensland Building Boost is a direct copy of the Northern Territory Build Bonus scheme, except that their scheme will last for eight months and that Queensland’s scheme will last for six months. I ask: is the tired 20-year old Labor government so devoid of initiative and ideas that it not only has to steal the LNP’s policy but it needs to steal the policies of the discredited Northern Territory Labor government as well? </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and for turning up to do some work today. Let us be really clear about what the government has proposed. It has proposed a $140 million housing stimulus package, which those opposite oppose. So I just say to each and every company out there in the property industry, each and every company that wants to go out there and build more homes for Queenslanders, each and every sparky, each and every tradie, each and every plumber, each and every retail worker working in a place like Bunnings, working at Harvey Norman--working at all of those places that supply materials for new houses--that those opposite do not support the $10,000 building boost. More to the point, so weak and gormless are they that they could not even say that yesterday. They left it out. They do not support it by omission. Because what are they? They are guilty of the omission of not putting forward any policies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002781"></A>
Let me say this: the $10,000 Building Boost program in Queensland is a nation-leading reform. It is a nation-leading package. What does it offer beyond that? It offers our nation-leading, first home owner zero stamp duty to $500,000. That means $17,000 for first home owners in Queensland. So the proposition for those people in Queensland who have not owned a home before is that, if they sign up to buy a new home, to build a new home over the six months of the Queensland Building Boost, zero stamp duty, zero mortgage duty and $17,000 in their back pocket from the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002782"></A>
There has never been a better time for those people who have been locked out of the housing market to get into the housing market in Queensland than over the next six months. What will the Building Boost do? It will promote jobs, which the opposition opposes. It will promote new houses, which the opposition opposes. What does the opposition propose as the alternative? What was the LNP’s plan? Did anyone hear one plan, one word about what it is they would do or how they would do it? No. What they came up with yesterday was puffery and rhetoric. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question and for her interest in what is happening in a diversifying Queensland economy. Next week I will be leading a trade delegation to both China and the US on a number of very important missions. China is the world’s second largest economy. Our trade with them last year in export dollars was worth $6.9 billion to Queensland. While I am in China I will be visiting with a number of organisations with an interest in investing further in Queensland. We will never tire of working hard in the region to make sure that the benefits of investing in Queensland are known to those people who want to be part of a growing economy like ours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004235"></A>
China has the world’s largest potential tourism market. We have seen very strong growth in the number of people in China who want to come and visit and experience Australia. To March this year we had 197,000 Chinese visiting our state, spending $388 million while they were here. We will be talking to a number of organisations about the opportunities to visit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004236"></A>
This will then lead to a trip into the United States where I will be leading the 13th Queensland delegation to the BIO conference. Our efforts in relation to our Smart State agenda are reaping benefits. When we started this agenda biotechnology was making about $150 million for the Queensland economy. What is it making now? $1 billion. We have a commitment to grow that to $4 billion by 2025 and at this rate we are more than on track. We now employ over 18,000 scientists and researchers in this area, which is more than double than when we started. We now are home to 100 core biotechnology companies employing 3,700 people. Our Smart State agenda is alive and well, creating jobs for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

We did not hear very much smart when we were here yesterday just after question time. What we heard was the astonishing news that Campbell Newman will slash the budget for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. He has made the most basic of errors. The Sunshine Coast is a social project. It does not have a toll. It is a public hospital. You do not pay fees and the hospital does not make a profit. So any money that you take out of this budget comes directly out of the operational budget of the Sunshine Coast hospital. He thinks this is a hollow log. This is caught out. I am not surprised that the member for Callide did not want to give that budget speech. It is the worst piece of social policy--the Sunshine Coast University Hospital to be slashed.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Health. Last year the government budgeted $1.972 billion to build the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, the hospital this government delayed for two years. This year the budget has risen to $2.033 billion for this project as a PPP. Why is it that a hospital the government is going to rent will cost more than a hospital it originally planned to own? Is this just another example of government waste and mismanagement or is the Treasurer muddying the water with dodgy numbers?</Hansard-Body>

What is the hollow log called? It is called the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. It has millions and millions of dollars of state funding in it and, heaven forbid, it is a PPP project that has been welcomed by the investment community.

If the LNP get into government and rip this funding out of this hospital project, there will be no hospital on the Sunshine Coast.

 We set out to craft a budget for 2011-12 that would take the pressure off households and that is what we have delivered. We have delivered a budget that will reduce electricity bills by removing the surcharge on those bills for the community ambulance levy which, as the member for Bulimba knows, will make a real difference. We have also increased the funding for the ClimateSmart Home Service which gives people a real opportunity to reduce their electricity costs by reducing their electricity use. </Hansard-Body>

I am very pleased to see the third parties who deal with people in a number of walks of life coming out and supporting the budget. QCOSS President Karyn Walsh says that removing the ambulance levy will also be a great help to struggling Queenslanders. In relation to the Building Boost we have funds there that will help first home buyers get into the market at a better rate than any other state of mainland Australia. What does that mean? Housing Industry Association Executive Director Warwick Temby says--</Hansard-Body>

Similarly, Colliers International said the $10,000 grant will attract buyers who may have otherwise sat on the sideline.

Now the Treasurer claims that the $2.033 billion includes rent costs for the next 20 years.

 Yesterday, the shadow minister for community services and housing made a very clear comment in the <Hansard-Italic>

 that she could not commit the LNP to increasing funding for social housing. That was the factual comment made. In stark contrast, Queenslanders can be very confident that this Labor government will continue to build more social housing. We know that affordable housing, jobs and safety nets for people on fixed and limited incomes are the best way to ease the cost-of-living pressures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005544"></A>
This budget provides an increase of $2.6 million this year for 3,000 more units of social housing under NRAS. We are seeing $369.8 million worth of social housing to build more than 1,400 units of social housing. Under our Queensland Future Growth Fund, $60 million will be provided for social housing. What did the shadow Treasurer tell us in his budget reply? He said that they will be having a look at the Queensland Future Growth Fund to find some efficiencies. What is that code for? That is code for, ‘We will take that social housing component, because we are not going to commit to increasing the spend on social housing, and we will put that in the bin and start again. We will not commit to social housing.’ </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Bundamba for her question and for her interest in ensuring that services can be provided to the communities and the families she represents in this place. I know that she was a strong advocate for the cost-of-living measures that the budget included. Let us understand the position this government has pursued. In recent times we have implemented the Southbank Institute of Technology PPP, which has won awards nationally. We are delivering schools under the $1.1 billion Aspire Schools Project. There are seven new schools, schools already delivered and schools coming online for the start of next year under a successful PPP. Airport Link, Australia’s largest transport PPP project, is 80 per cent delivered and delivered for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005564"></A>
Of course, now the government is out in the marketplace and has received five expressions of interest for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital at $2.03 billion. That full amount of money is required to be in the budget papers by the National Public Private Partnership Guidelines, which I table for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the de facto leader of the LNP who is not in this place.</Hansard-Body>

Those guidelines clearly state that when it comes to a social infrastructure PPP, the full capital cost needs to be there. Members must understand that Campbell Newman’s proposal to rip $400 million out of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital will put at peril the ability to deliver the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. The five consortia already in the process will be quivering at the concept that $400 million will be ripped out, which is what Campbell Newman said to the <Hansard-Italic>

. He said $100 million a year over four years would be ripped out of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. </Hansard-Body>

What we saw yesterday was someone who, when it comes to a policy explanation, can’t do. He was asked to nominate the number that the LNP would take out of that project. Anyone who watched the press conference last night would know that he did not know the number. What did the LNP do afterwards? It cobbled together four pages and called it a policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005568"></A>
Let us have a look at these four pages. The first page contains a couple of sentences in which they said that they would rip out $180 million, but Campbell Newman told the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 it was $400 million. We would like to know is he ripping out $180 million or $400 million? The next two pages comprised an article from the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
. Talk about plagiarism; the last page is a copy of a page out of my budget. What they should have done is turned over two more pages and then the shadow Treasurer would not have needed to ask his question. At footnote 2 it says that the total estimated cost for the Sunshine Coast Academic Research Centre is $60 million. </Hansard-Body>

Bruce Highway, Cooroy-Curra Upgrade</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mr GIBSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. I refer to section B of the Bruce Highway Cooroy-Curra bypass. I also refer to the fact that last week the Gympie coroner reported on the tragic death by incineration of a couple and their unborn baby on this section of road in 2008. The coroner said that the road was found to be a hazard due to the high volume of traffic. Considering this is the second year in a row of a massive underspend on this stretch of road, when will the minister gives the thousands of motorists who drive on this highway daily certainty that it will be finished before another life is lost? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007086"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, that is a very good question from the member for Gympie. Following investigations into three fatal crashes on the Bruce Highway south of Gympie, my department provided its findings to the Coroners Court to assist that coronial inquiry. While the department’s investigations did not identify any contributing factors regarding the road for each of the crashes, the department has undertaken a number of safety initiatives along the Bruce Highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007088"></A>
Let us not forget that this is a federally funded road. Some of those initiatives include $2.2 million to improve line marking on the median strip along the centre line of the road, a joint departmental exercise with the Queensland Police Service to impose a 90-kilometre-per-hour speed limit on the highway between Cooroy and the Wide Bay Highway intersection, and $2.8 million to install variable message signs. Any death on our highways, be it the Bruce Highway or any other highway across Queensland, is something that we greatly regret. Indeed, I note from the coroner’s findings that increased traffic on that particular highway did contribute to those fatal accidents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007091"></A>
I have said it before in this House and I will say it again: both sides of federal politics have let down the Bruce Highway for the last 40 years. I want to congratulate the current federal Labor government, which has more than quadrupled funding for the Bruce Highway, but it is coming from a very, very low base. Anyone in regional Queensland knows that. Any accident on our highway is regrettable, but we do need serious funding for the Bruce Highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007092"></A>
Something that we do not need on the Bruce Highway is a toll. I will never stand for a toll on the Bruce Highway whilst I am in this place. Over my dead body will Labor toll the Bruce Highway to bring it up to speed. We need serious commitments from the federal government in Canberra for the Bruce, not only from Cooroy to Curra but right along that road. It is in desperate need of further funding. I say congratulations to federal Labor. It has more than quadrupled funding for the Bruce, but it is coming from a very low base. I thank the member for that question. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MOORHEAD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer and Minister for State Development and Trade. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the budgeting standards required for social infrastructure public-private partnerships? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007100"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Waterford for his question and for his advocacy for the cost-of-living measures and the investment in the jobs of the future that this budget and this government are providing. Let us understand really clearly the basic error of fact that Campbell Newman and the shadow Treasurer have made in presenting their so-called budget reply yesterday. The fact is that there is no toll on the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. A $2 billion hospital requires $2 billion to build it. Any amount of money that they rip out of it will result in fewer beds and services in that hospital. The assertion of Campbell Newman that he should be trusted because he knows how to save money in a PPP would be laughable if it were not so serious. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007103"></A>
I point to all the money he saved from the Clem7 PPP. He said it would cost $850 million, then $2 billion and then $3 billion. That was such a successful PPP that it is now in receivership. So when Campbell Newman says to the people of Queensland, ‘Trust me, I can save money from a PPP,’ it is like the member for Warrego saying, ‘Trust me, I’ll take you on a nice flight.’ It is just a flight of fancy. But guess what? The landing is pretty rough. Just like when the wheels do not go down, when it comes to the PPP record of Campbell Newman the wheels do not go down either, other than to go down beyond and into ever-increasing debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007104"></A>
Let us be very clear: unless Campbell Newman commits the full $2 billion to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital today then the hospital will not be built to the program. The member for Kawana and the member for Buderim and all of those who have grandstanded but have never got a commitment should demand that Campbell Newman reinstate the full amount of money. They should demand that he reinstate the $180 million that he has now admitted he wants to pull out and the $400 million that is in his secret plan to pull out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007106"></A>
What is more, he should explain to the people of Queensland why it is that he believes he can pull money out under the budgeting standards that are pursued in this nation. The answer is that he cannot. He cannot do that. He does not have a plan. He has come in here only with a plan for his own career, only with rhetoric and slogans. As soon as the torch was turned on, as soon as the questions were asked, as soon as he had to nominate a number, as soon as he had to stand up and deliver, what happened? He melted, because he has got nothing. As it turns out, he is all swagger and no dagger. He has never, ever been burdened by a lack of self-doubt, but he is burdened by the fact that when it comes to economics he does not have a clue. He has no plan for Queensland other than a plan for his own ego and his own career. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for the Arts. The minister has had public servants contacting arts organisations to demand that one of her advisers be present whenever I meet arts groups to discuss policy issues. I ask: what has the minister got to hide? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007111"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member’s allegation is untrue. I have made no such request and, indeed, was not aware that he was meeting with arts groups. But, of course, funded or unfunded, the member is quite welcome to do so. Nonetheless, I am happy to contrast this government’s commitment to the arts with that of the opposition. If the member wants a briefing, I am happy to advise him that in this week’s budget the government, having built the enormously successful Gallery of Modern Art--now the most successful gallery in the country--and having extended the State Library in recent years, has committed $18 million to the Queensland Museum, the repository of our natural and social history, so that the museum can take the next step in its growth. What did the LNP leader, Mr Newman, say about that $18 million commitment? Mr Newman described the commitment to our museum, a museum that has 149 years of history as a repository of our state’s natural and cultural history, as a ‘sprinkle of fairy dust’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007112"></A>
If the member wants to know about what is happening in the arts, I am happy to tell him that this government is 100 per cent committed. We have built GoMA, now the largest and most comprehensive gallery in the country and its most successful.  We have extended the State Library, and with this budget we are extending grants to community libraries right around the state for the betterment of all Queenslanders. We will now extend the Queensland Museum, updating its foyer and putting $5.5 million into new exhibition space. That is a choice that we are happy to stand by and which the member is quite welcome to be briefed about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007113"></A>
With the benefit of that briefing, he might want to go to his leader and suggest that that is not just fairy dust but that it is for the betterment of the heart and soul of our community. His leader when at the BCC had a proven track record of cutting the arts. He cut $750,000 out of emerging artists grants. He took $60,000 out of Creative Sparks. He cut $928,000 from the library books budget. The member is welcome to that information and I hope that he will share it with his leader, because the arts are for the good of all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

 Thank you, I can. I have disturbing news to report to the House. It seems that the tollgate affair gets even worse. The newspaper and journalist who reported that the LNP want to toll the Bruce Highway was bullied yesterday by Mr Mike D’Arcy, who I believe is an agent for one Mr Campbell Newman. Following the revelations in the House yesterday, I am advised that this Mr D’Arcy rang the newspaper demanding a retraction. Newspapers like the <Hansard-Italic>
Innisfail Advocate</Hansard-Italic>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am delighted to assist the honourable member with this. In fact it has been an interesting week, hasn’t it? Now we understand why the Leader of the Opposition did not do the speech in reply, because he is smart enough not to want to do it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition’s contribution made the member for Surfers Paradise’s contribution from last year look like something from John Kenneth Galbraith. Certainly it was a new low point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008624"></A>
This government on 20 May passed new electoral laws which then commenced--the final piece of our reform agenda to clean up politics. But it has been very interesting. We have seen a few contemporary activities that are worthy of commentary bearing this in mind. We saw a one Geoff Greene, a former state director of the LNP, take his party to court because he did not get life membership and he lost income. What was the detail of that? His claim in the Supreme Court against his party was that life membership would be o f substantial benefit to assist him to earn an income as a political adviser, campaign adviser and lobbyist. He is claiming that what that cost him, in the party of filthy lucre, is $701,071.33 in future losses. He would be able to, on a conservative estimate, procure for himself or for his employer at least six accounts that he would not otherwise gain in the 2011-12 state election which would result in him earning an additional income of between $124,200 and $135,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008627"></A>
What is the business that he owns now and operates? The old faithful--Entree Vous. Of course, who else has an association with Entree Vous? The member for Mudgeeraba--she was not as successful; she only had three clients then but she had a lot of pictures of Tony Abbott and everyone else on the page--and Michael Caltabiano, the man who was so disliked, the new Santo Santoro of the Liberal Party, that his own electorate got rid of him. That is what we have seen on the other side. It is there in open court matters. On the other side of politics they see membership of their party and senior official status as being a mechanism to earn money to stick in their pocket. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008629"></A>
They have another opportunity in the next month or so with their state conference on. Again it is cash for access. Who could have forgotten the $20,000 a head dinner which the then Leader of the Opposition would not reveal who went to? We know now because it is in court documents that in the Liberal and National Party cash is king. The only thing is that they cannot find any cash for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Beaudesert for his question and for his interest and advocacy to ensure we adequately resource the Queensland Police Service. In this budget what we see is that the $1.8 billion budget for the Queensland Police Service has been increased--increased substantially--to $1.9 billion in this coming year of 2011-12. What that does is continue our commitment to maintain more police going into the force to meet our election commitment to have an extra 600 police officers in the field over the term of this parliament to ensure we can keep up with the national police-to-population ratio and to ensure we can make the investments in police technology and in police equipment that are required for a modern police service servicing this state. Everyone in recent times has seen just how much police officers give of themselves to serve our community. All of that money is invested in a service that is there to keep each and every one of us safe at the peril of those individual officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010236"></A>
What you see in this budget is an additional investment in order to put GPS tracking into Corrective Services to ensure community safety is enhanced. There are also investments in the vehicle fleet for the Police Service to ensure the fleet is upgraded and maintained. There is an opportunity to make further investments into the future for such things as the technology the member is talking about, and that will be taken seriously in each budget process. The member’s question goes directly to an interest in public service delivery--the sort of public service delivery that the opposition wants to cut out from those on the Sunshine Coast, who have a legitimate expectation that the full $2 billion that was put into the Capital Statement should be kept for the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>

I make a prediction here that we will not see the ridiculous concept of Campbell Newman standing in front of someone at a press conference today; in fact, I do not think we will see him at all today. I think he would have scarpered. He will be running at a million miles an hour. He will be running around up there on level 6, up on tippy-toes, waving his arms around, projecting himself, pointing fingers and blaming people, hopping into all the staff members, getting into the shadow Treasurer, saying to the Leader of the Opposition that it is his fault, doing a nana. What happened yesterday when push came to shove, when the heat came on, when the questions got asked? We found someone who does not have what it takes, who has been down there playing in the under-20s. The rule in the NRL Toyota Cup is this: no work and no study equals no play. If Campbell Newman were playing in the under-20s he would not be allowed on the football field. It is time to do the homework, do the policy grunt; put up or get out of the way.</Hansard-Body>

While we can analyse the economic impact, it is the personal stories of hardship and bravery, of loss and tragedy, that are burned into our collective memories, to be followed by the remarkable efforts of thousands who stepped up to the mark to assist in myriad ways when their neighbour or fellow Queenslander was crying out for help. From our Defence Force, emergency services personnel, workers from many sectors, students, volunteers and help from other states and countries, we witnessed remarkable scenes. It is against this background that I want to congratulate our Treasurer, the Premier and all those who worked on this most important of budgets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010272"></A>
Prior to Tuesday, I came to this sitting with no high expectations. We normally have a wish list for our electorates which we hope may attract some funding. However, I left my hopes for the future firmly with those who have suffered so much and hoped for funding to rebuild our roads, bridges and public infrastructure and to assist wherever possible those who have had the heartache of homes, properties and businesses flooded or damaged in the cyclone. No state has had to deal with destruction on such a massive scale and, though it will take time, however frustrating those delays may be, the state has risen to the occasion in a magnificent way with so many pitching in to help, whether they be paid workers or those magnificent volunteers, some of whom are still out there giving of their time and energy. Logan city had a very small number of homes flooded; others were saved due to the Wyaralong Dam being completed ahead of time. Thus, much of the upstream flow was retained and the newly completed dam filled to capacity. Many of our organisations and people spread out into the Lockyer, to Brisbane and throughout the state to assist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010273"></A>
I now turn to the budget. It has been crafted in such a way that those needing support and services--such as in the Woodridge electorate and more widely in Logan city--will indeed still receive support from our outstanding services with some increases. While many are doing it tough, there are additional measures to ease the cost-of-living pressures. Our education, health, transport and roads have additional funding. Due to the federal stimulus package, many new houses and units of accommodation have been built in the Logan area, and stable housing with lower rental will ease the burden for many. Our schools have received very significant funding due to the federal stimulus package, and every school in the Woodridge electorate now has wonderful new facilities, such as halls, resource centres, libraries, science labs and lecture theatres. It is an absolute joy to see how this has enabled so many additional activities in our schools.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010274"></A>
A job and stable income are the very basis of how an individual or family rises above difficult circumstances. Many hundreds of individuals are assisted year after year through Skilling Queenslanders for Work and our Green Army program to find work. This 12 months has seen 24,000 people assisted into jobs and this will continue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013972"></A>
I would now like to spell out some of the more significant budget items which will impact our Woodridge electorate in a very positive way, as well as the wider area of Logan. Education is one of our highest priorities. This year a new kindergarten will be built at the Kingston State School at a cost of $1.74 million. Three kindy programs will receive funding: $37,000 at the Logan Central Children’s Community centre, $84,000 at the Marsden Nursery and Child Care Centre and $37,000 at Grow Logan Central. This funding is of great importance. Also, the Kingston College Trade Training Centre is about to take shape at a cost of $2.827 million. A further announcement that I received after the budget was that there will be a kindergarten at the Woodridge North State School. The principal of that school has been working towards this for a long time and she is just overjoyed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013979"></A>
Transport and roads infrastructure has received some very welcome funding. The $4 million Logan Central bus station has at last commenced this month, so there will be no more sitting in the hot summer sun facing the west waiting for a bus outside the Logan Central Shopping Centre. A $1.2 million upgrade of the Woodridge Railway Station has also commenced and I share with my colleagues from Springwood and Waterford $159.7 million to continue the upgrade of the Pacific Motorway. There is an amount of $1.9 million for various cycleways, keeping our community healthy and active; $40,000 to improve the intersection of Browns Plains Road and First Avenue; and $50,000 to improve the Trinder Park rail crossing intersection.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011894"></A>
I like to refer to my electorate as a cradle of superb human services. People come, we plug them into our services and they have their lives improved and changed, and our social programs in Logan are second to none. In terms of seniors, $668,000 goes to the Home Assist Secure program to keep seniors in their homes. The increased funding we have seen for support for people with disabilities, mental illness, foster and kinship-carers, domestic and sexual violence support, drug counselling and support, pregnant and parenting young people, residential care for young people, and specialised Aboriginal and Islander service and intervention services will not only keep those services very strong but also be able to outreach to many more people. There is a lot more emphasis in this year’s budget on early intervention, and that is so important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011898"></A>
Youth and sports funding is also important to us. There is $10,000 for additional hours for PCYC school-age care; $103,000 for a multipurpose outdoor facility at the PCYC at Crestmead; $74,000 to upgrade the field lighting for the rugby league at Civic Park; $52,000 for a coordinator to support touch footy in Logan and the Gold Coast; and another $52,000 for a coordinator to support 10 pin bowling in South-East Queensland. A number of multicultural workers have also been supported and in health there is the $230 million upgrade to the Logan Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011906"></A>
This is a good Labor budget which looks after those who need our exceptional services in health and social services. In education we now have a prep year, with the national curriculum about to be rolled out throughout the state. The Premier’s announcement last week that year 7 will now move into high school has been welcomed by my community. In our schools we have exceptional principals, teachers and staff putting in huge effort to increase outcomes for our youngsters and we are seeing results that show us that we are making a difference. We have recognised that the cost of living is causing stress on many of our families and individuals. The abolition of the ambulance levy on electricity bills will assist every householder and a number of rebates for pensioners have been increased--electricity up to $230, council rates up to $200 and the water subsidy up to $120. I encourage residents to enlist the ClimateSmart Home Service with the latest stand-by power eliminator, which could reduce power bills by an additional $190.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011910"></A>
I again stress the importance to our economy of jobs. The measures announced in the budget to offer $10,000 over the next six months to those purchasing a newly-built home as well as the $7,000 for first homebuyers will entice many into the market and thus stimulate this very important sector of our economy. Similarly, the increase of $83,000 for major events in the state has the ability to bring many additional visitors to our state to enjoy our world-class attractions. Queenslanders will once again be the powerhouse of our nation and we can thank the direction this Labor government took when things really got tough. I commend our Treasurer, Premier and leadership team and support the bills. </Hansard-Body>

It sees the abolition of the ambulance levy--saving 1.4 million Queensland families and small business $113 on their electricity bills. Importantly, every Queenslander will still have access to an outstanding Ambulance service, and will no longer have to pay the levy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

It includes the $140 million Qld Building Boost -a six month, $140 million initiative that will provide a $10,000 grant for all Queenslanders constructing or purchasing a new home up to the value of $600,000, with first home buyers also eligible for the $7,000 first home buyers grant.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

After a very tumultuous year of freakishly devastating weather events and global financial crises, the budget handed down this week does offer hope and promise for Queenslanders. The next few years in Queensland will see unprecedented growth and private investment as well as assistance towards household budgets struggling with the cost of living. We will be positioned as the nation’s economic powerhouse once again, and this is despite the fractured international backdrop. The Mundingburra electorate which I represent has a core element, and that is family and all of the essentials that go with families--hospitals, schools, TAFE, university, small business, shopping centres, sports venues and so on. It is landlocked, it has no council and has a large proportion of pensioners, public servants and defence personnel. </A></Hansard-Body>

The concerns of Australians are reflected in my electorate, and I am pleased to say that this budget has benefits that will have a positive impact for all constituents. It is good news with initiatives to simultaneously stimulate demand in the residential housing sector as well as addressing housing affordability. The economic road ahead for Queensland is amazing, with an investment surge guaranteed to take us into a new era of prosperity. Economic growth, new jobs and broad based expansion will have a positive impact on those living in my electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011975"></A>
While the LNP candidate for Mundingburra, David Crisafulli, was very quick to criticise with very much hollow misinformation focusing on interest repayments, the people of Townsville will not forget his abysmal track record when it comes to his own local government budget. The Deputy Mayor of Townsville has presided over--I would say--probably the worst administration in decades, mismanaging budget after budget with gay abandon. I think David Crusafulli has a real lot of hide actually to make such outrageous statements when he hid from his increased rates and from his increased water charges. One thing we know about David Crusafulli is that when it is time to make the tough decisions we know where he will be--he will be hiding at the back of a crowd somewhere. But let me continue with the hallmarks of this year’s budget, and I turn to the new Queensland Building Boost. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

This initiative is a continuance of this Government’s commitment to ensuring that all Queenslanders can access the home-owners market. The Queensland Government will offer $10,000 grants to any person or corporation buying or building a new home. This grant is in addition to the $7,000 first home buyers grant, which means Queenslanders can receive $17, 000 worth of first home buyers assistance, which is the most generous state-wide housing grant in the nation. To fund this $140 million initiative, the Government has had to remove the standing transfer duty concession for homebuyers, but despite this fact, Queensland will continue to have the lowest standard stamp duty rates for all mainland States of Australia. Of course, those first homes purchases up to $500, 000 will carry zero stamp duty. Not only does this grant give opportunities to new home buyers but it will also give life to Queensland’s third-largest job generating industry: the housing construction sector. This is exactly the fuel this industry required after the global financial crisis put pressure upon its growth and it is an example of this Government’s commitment to rebuilding this great state.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011981"></A>
In conjunction with the $140 million Building Boost, the Government will also address the costs of living by spending $139 million to abolish the $113 ambulance levy on electricity bills. The ambulance services will continue to be available free for all Queenslanders--it is part of this Government’s commitment to relieving those families and individuals who are doing it tough. This subsidy is part of $1.385 billion worth of concessions which include increasing the electricity rebates for pensioners and seniors from $200 to $230 and increasing the maximum council rates rebate for pensioners to $200. This level of concessions is the best in the nation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011982"></A>
I am very proud of this Government’s recent education reform. I am thrilled to be part of a Government that has instituted the reforms they have put forward over the past 13 years and this one is no different. Moving grade 7 into high school is a significant reform for the Queensland public education system. It will give year 7 students a better start to their senior schooling lives, and it will mean that they are getting the best environment for their educational, social and emotional needs. In this budget the Government has allocated $328.2 million over four years for additional capital funding in state schools, and $293.8 million in additional recurrent funding which includes $81 million of capital assistance funds to the non-state sector. This a big move by this Government and we have ensured that we have the necessary financial resources to ensure this transition is managed correctly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011983"></A>
Overall this is a very healthy budget. The aim to ensure that Queensland’s economy remains sustainable and that we continue to grow and recover from the global financial crisis. This past financial year business investment in Queensland grew by 13% which exceeded the 9.5% forecast. This level of growth is 8.5% better than the nation. Business confidence in Queensland is growing, we are entering a new era of prosperity and with investment set to increase by 27.75% next year, and will remain at 21% the year after, the best in the nation. Our economic growth this year was at 5% and it is forecasted to increase to 5.25% next year with increased investment and job opportunities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011984"></A>
In my electorate, the budget addresses the major concerns of the State with an eye on the future. Life is restored to housing construction industry, cost of living will be eased, our education system is growing in strength, and ensuring that Queensland’s economic growth is and continues to be a lucrative option for investment. Around $473,000 had also been allocated for important community health education campaigns in North Queensland and a half million dollar boost from the State Budget to build a new special Education facility at Heatley State School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Maryborough has always done very well in the budget. In fact, I remember that after the last election a LNP member said that the Maryborough electorate had received nothing while it had an Independent member representing it. Of course that was utter nonsense, because we had received around about $967 million or a figure thereabouts in six years.</A></Hansard-Body>

This is a terribly difficult year for any electorate to get money, but I am glad for what my area has received. My electorate received around $163,789,000 in direct funding and a share of a further $74,477,000, along with other areas. The Wide Bay area received the third-highest allocation of funds in the whole state, at $1,106,854,000. Certainly some money is flowing into the Wide Bay area. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1014200"></A>
In detail, in relation to the Department of Communities, there is a share of $3,273,000, $4,688,000 and $6,161,000 for property, plant and equipment and capital works on existing dwellings and housing and homelessness services. Under more direct funding, under the Department of Community Safety there is a replacement Craignish auxiliary fire station. In this particular budget there is $940,000 being spent of $1.240 million for the entire station, because previously, in the last budget, $300,000 was spent. Also in direct funding in my electorate, under the heading of Education and Training, $1,001,000 is being spent on St Helen’s State School, which is a great state school--and a very historical one in my electorate--for additional accommodation. There is also some money under the heading of Employment, Education and Training for distribution augmentation for WBB subtransmissions. There is about $35 million being spent in my area, not necessarily in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014205"></A>
Under DERM there has been $25 million spent in my area, mostly under various amounts for SunWater. In relation to Health funding, I am disappointed that we did not get more funding for the Maryborough Hospital, but I will talk about that in more detail in a moment. Under Health, there is $97.7 million flagged over the next five years. There is a regional mental health services plan that will be rolled out over the next five years that involves an amount of $97.7 million. That will be a very significant spend. This is an area that I have talked a lot about in parliament. I really feel for the fact that the Maryborough Mental Health Unit, which has about 15 inpatient beds, is really struggling. Effectively, it means that only the 14 sickest people in my area of Maryborough and the surrounding areas can be catered for at any one time as inpatients. A lot more money needs to be spent in the area of people with mental health issues. There is also a range of funding allocations for Justice, Local Government, Police and Public Works. Those amounts are $279,456,000, $447,216,000, $227,306,000 and, at page 94, $1,340,382. But again, that funding is spread across a region, not particularly my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014208"></A>
I must say that, coming from an accountancy and financial planning background, this budget has been a horror to try to read. Everything is just lumped in together. There are things like $700 million to be spent in an area, but you just cannot get to the heart of where the money is actually being spent. I must say that it makes doing a decent speech in response to the budget a very difficult proposition, because there simply is not enough detail. Lumping stuff together or rolling it in together and saying, ‘This funding is over a few years for this, that and the other,’ is just not sufficient in order to properly report on what is being given to our electorates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014210"></A>
I return to specific funding for my electorate. Under Transport, EDI Rail has done very well for my region. It is a dynamic business. I was extremely disappointed to see that it had pulled out of the tender for the very large contract coming up, leaving Bombardier to dance alone, as it were, with the tender process. There is $161,848,000 in this budget, and that includes $57,648,000 for the Sunlander, 14 rolling stock and 40 three-carriage passenger trains at a cost of $97 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014214"></A>
There is a share of funding for some roadworks for the Maryborough-Cooloola Road and the stretch of road from Gympie to Maryborough--some pavement reconstruction. But again, there is just not enough detail, and I would urge the Treasurer in future budgets to at least give members of parliament, if not the general public, a more precise breakdown of what we get for our particular areas to allow for a reasonable comparison. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014215"></A>
Like I said before, the Wide Bay area received the third-highest allocation of funds with $1,106,854, which is encouraging. Also, according to the big picture, $140 million has been set aside to reduce the cost of electricity bills by abolishing the community ambulance levy; $411 million to ensure that all Queensland electricity customers pay a similar price; $166 million in cost-of-living concessions for pensioners and seniors--that is, rates and electricity; $339 million for regional freight and passenger transport subsidies, including air services and bus services throughout Bundaberg, Gympie, Maryborough and coach services at Eidsvold and Monto; and $55 million to be spent on the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme. That scheme continues to be a burr in the saddle of those people in Maryborough who have to travel a long way and who receive a patient travel subsidy that is manifestly inadequate. There is also $147 million for school transport assistance schemes and also part of $1.8 million for the lower Mary catchment irrigation distribution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014217"></A>
This week the Liberal National Party has talked a lot about the fact that the interest on money owed from the Queensland budget is around $595,000 per hour, which is an extraordinarily frightening figure. I have to say that that sort of figure really worries me in terms of the future of Queensland. I urge the Treasurer to try to get that debt under better control, because if the average Queenslander thinks about $600,000 an hour just in interest they will think the borrowings are absolutely scary. I think that is an issue that all Queenslanders would be feeling particularly nervous about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014218"></A>
I would have liked the Treasurer to give us a lot more money for Maryborough Hospital. I think there needs to be a lot of money spent ramping up services at that hospital. I look forward to a timely delivery of the dialysis unit, which has been promised for midyear, but I would like to see a lot more money spent on A&amp;E services, particularly in the provision of some accident and emergency specialists. I have long prosecuted the argument in this chamber that the Maryborough Hospital A&amp;E unit should be the major hospital A&amp;E unit for the area because of its proximity to the highway and the fact that Hervey Bay Hospital is effectively at the end of a cul-de-sac. You have to drive past Maryborough Hospital to get there. I am not saying that they should not have good services--the area of Hervey Bay Hospital certainly has the bigger population--but when one looks at the catchment population of Maryborough one sees that we are really on a very similar footing. I would like to see more money spent there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016116"></A>
Maryborough also needs more money for finishing off Queens Park. We have this fantastic park with pathways to walk on which are completely overgrown with mangroves. I have been speaking to various ministers about being able to finish that off with a permanent rock wall to provide community safety and finally finish off the Reddacliff plan which has been in train for quite some time. </Hansard-Body>

I would also like to see a significant amount of money allocated in future budgets for special education services in Maryborough. Having recently gone to the opening of some new facilities at the Maryborough Special School and also knowing of the great work that our high schools and primary schools do--I am thinking in particular of Aldridge State High School and Maryborough West State School that have an enormous task of looking after kids with special needs in education--I would like to see some more funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016122"></A>
Finally, I must echo some of the disappointments from my constituents in terms of the impact on housing and real estate in our area. Maryborough is a fantastic place. One can still buy a really good family home in Maryborough for $250,000 to $300,000. To give members an idea of the situation, as set out in the <Hansard-Italic>
Fraser Coast Chronicle</Hansard-Italic>
 today, for a person to buy a four-bedroom three-bathroom house the current price is $305,000. The stamp duty on that transaction is $3,050, but on 1 August that will skyrocket to $8,500. That will have an extremely deleterious effect on the real estate market in our area. There are certainly some grave concerns about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016123"></A>
Whilst I acknowledge the fact that this budget is delivering a good deal for new homeowners, it is the case that some people will have to downsize their homes. In the case of a divorce or something like that they will have a situation where they will need to sell property. This new stamp duty regime will really hurt them and the real estate market in our area. I would urge the Treasurer to make whatever changes are necessary not to cripple the industry. I look forward to an even greater spend for the Maryborough area in the budget next year. </Hansard-Body>

What we have seen this week is another breathtaking display from the slick Labor Treasurer who loves to talk the talk but is yet to deliver a good budget with a good bottom line. This is a budget that fails to deliver real reform to ease the costs of living for Queensland families. Since becoming Treasurer in 2007, his irresponsible mismanagement of our economy is now costing every Queenslander $595,000 per hour every hour, every day just in interest payment debt alone. Our debt is increasing despite the rapid fire sale of our assets which the Bligh Labor government neglected to tell the people of Queensland about prior to the last election. </A></Hansard-Body>

After the jubilation of the ambulance levy being removed has passed, Queensland residents will wake up to the sobering reality that their electricity prices will continue to rise under this government as well as their car registration and fuel costs.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016133"></A>
It is no shock to those of us who sit on this side of the House that those opposite lost touch with the views of the community a very long time ago. The people of Queensland are hurting, with our state now the highest in mortgage defaults. It is no wonder when this Labor government is constantly trying to find ways to increase our living costs because it cannot balance a budget. This is a government backflipping all over the place, lurching from crisis to crisis and creating policy on the run based on polls. Those seated opposite would know the polls are clearly showing that the people of Queensland no longer believe the rhetoric and spin they are peddling. The Bligh Labor government has shown with this budget that it gives with one hand yet takes away with the other. The people of Queensland are stuck in a time warp with this arrogant, tired Labor government rehashing, reannouncing and reinventing those same old tired announcements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016134"></A>
It is crystal clear to the opposition and the people of Queensland that this government has run out of ideas. Our long-term problems are being ignored and continue to get worse whilst those opposite have no shortage of excuses and promises that are broken time and time again. This is a government that has a habit of building projects that are either over budget or extended longer than the completion deadline and then blow out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016135"></A>
What is in the budget for my electorate? At first glance it looks promising--like it did the previous two years. There are quite a few lines in the budget where it looks like money is being directed to my area. But it is not until one actually reads the details that one realises that, not surprisingly, it is not what it looks like. There is not a lot that is new. The majority of money is old money being reannounced, rehashed and rebadged. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016136"></A>
Just recently I sent out a survey to all of the residents in my electorate asking for their feedback on what was important to them and what they would like to fix. My office has been overwhelmed by the number of responses, with many residents jumping at the chance to have their say. I will be quoting in my speech today some of their comments as a reminder to those seated opposite that we are here to represent the people of Queensland and not ourselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016137"></A>
What were the biggest issues that were repeated over and over again in my survey? It is no surprise that again it was roads, law and order, government accountability and, in particular, the M1 which runs right through the middle of my electorate and remains the single biggest issue affecting residents not only in my electorate but also on the entire Gold Coast. Because of this I now have a very good working knowledge of roads, with even the local paper dubbing me the ‘member for the M1’ with seven overpasses in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016138"></A>
It comes as no surprise that we have the Queensland Minister for Main Roads and the federal minister for infrastructure continually trying to rewrite history to suit themselves. Labor never lets the truth get in the way of a good story. The $910 million Pacific Motorway upgrade was jointly funded by the Howard coalition government and the Beattie Labor government and has absolutely nothing to do with the Gillard-Bligh Labor governments. The state Labor government continually bleated that it could not upgrade the M1 until the federal government tipped some money in. Well, tip it in it did. I stood on the roundabout at Gooding Drive in 2007 when the Howard government announced funding of $455 million, which was more than what was asked for. This was not a pork-barrel election promise, this was funding in the AusLink mark II budget. Not a single cent has been given by the Gillard government to the Gold Coast for roads, yet those opposite try to claim that it is contributing to the M1 upgrade by reannouncing that funding already allocated by Howard. Gold Coast residents are sick and tired of sitting in the Mudgeeraba car park on the M1 because of this arrogant, tired Labor government’s inability to build for the future. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to quote some comments from the residents in Reedy Creek who have suffered as a consequence of the ill-planned interchange upgrade at exit 85, one which was designed by bureaucrats in Brisbane who had no idea of the local traffic and were not even aware of further residential estates being opened up in the area. One resident says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1016143"></A>
Living in Reedy Creek is still a nightmare when it comes to traffic. No quick access to the M1 south. It is extremely frustrating as the traffic lights are not synchronised and are far too long at the crossing over Reedy Creek Road. Only a bunch of idiots could have designed such a time consuming and inefficient set of roads. They clearly don’t reside in the area.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 I will withdraw it, but it was a comment from one of my constituents. Here is another comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1016147"></A>
At enormous expense, an absolute stuff up has been caused at the Gemvale Road/Reedy Creek Road corner by replacing the roundabout with 3 sets of traffic lights. To get onto Reedy Creek Road or the M1 Southbound, I generally have to stop at all 4 sets of traffic lights because they are not set correctly to allow traffic to flow, which is incredibly frustrating particularly at times when there is absolutely no traffic! I am so upset to see that nothing has been learned from that disaster, and there are plans to spend yet more millions of dollars to change the roundabout system at Exit 82 Robina Interchange, which works perfectly at the moment with just peak hour lights.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018036"></A>
There were many more responses, and I could utilise the rest of my time reading them but the language is not flattering to Main Roads or the minister. </Hansard-Body>

Local roads such as Beechmont Road, Springbrook Road and Worongary Road also missed out on funding for much needed upgrades. This is despite the fact that traffic is increasing on those roads and the lack of proper maintenance is turning them into patchwork quilts. Beechmont Road has been waiting for its $2.5 million upgrade, which was pledged in the lead-up to the 2009 election, but it has been held up over a stand of macadamia trees by federal DERM. Only recently we have had a fatality and two near misses on RACQ’s worst state controlled main road, and this government’s history shows it will only react when someone dies. The $400,000 funding for the upgrade of Springbrook Road has been held up after one call from Aila Keto to the director-general of Main Roads brought the works to an abrupt halt for over six months over supposed rare and endangered species. In Springbrook, the only rare and endangered species is the residents, with a government more concerned about trees than people. Another response to my survey which is typical of the majority of responses states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018045"></A>
Roads, roads and roads. Lived in area since 1987 and the roads, especially Beechmont Road, is getting worse--not better. So many lump, bumps, dips, rough earns and so on. Very dangerous with more and more incidents and accidents. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018046"></A>
We have seen this arrogant, tired, old Labor government do backflips almost on cue on issues and policies that the LNP can-do team has announced. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018047"></A>
As I said at the beginning, another important issue that came out of my survey was law and order. This is a real concern to the people of the Gold Coast as our way of life has been affected by armed thugs and increasingly by those who are high on illegal drugs. Sophisticated drug lags are popping up as a result of the need, which alarmingly is more prevalent amongst our younger generation. One of my constituents has commented as follows--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018049"></A>
At my age, 84, and a recent widow, I would appreciate our local police station to stay open, than close their doors at 4 pm etc. To catch criminals, hoons, and graffiti people, make Mudgeeraba and many like myself feel much safer. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018050"></A>
In fact, many residents wrote about changing the Mudgeeraba Police Station to a 24-hour counter service. This House should be well aware of this as I have previously lodged a petition on the matter. I put the Minister for Police on notice that the next issue I will be lobbying for will be a new police station to be built at Reedy Creek--and I repeat, Reedy Creek--not Robina. As an election sweetner for the previous member for Mudgeeraba, in 2006 this government announced that a new police station would be built at Reedy Creek. However, when the new station opened in 2010, where was it located? It is in Robina and it does not even service Reedy Creek. I know that Robina also starts with an ‘R’, but yet again this is a slap in the face to the residents who live west of the M1. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018052"></A>
Despite more armed hold-ups on the Gold Coast--almost double the number in Brisbane--it was only after the thin blue line lost one of its finest in an armed hold-up that this arrogant state Labor government pilfered another LNP tough-on-crime policy and finally funded a dedicated armed robbery squad to be based on the Gold Coast. In the past two years in the electorate of Mudgeeraba, many businesses have been held up including the Bonogin general store, the Woodland Plaza convenience store, the Reedy Creek bakery, the bottle shops at Bell Place and Worongary Shopping Village, not to mention the Boonaroo Park shopping centre, which has been hit time after time. It is a can-do Campbell Newman LNP government that will be tough on crime, not a Labor government that is soft on crime, soft on hooning--and, by the way, it copied the LNP’s Hoon Watch--soft on graffiti and lenient on sentencing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018057"></A>
The budget provided a further $1 million of a $2 million allocation to upgrade the women’s facility at the Numinbah Valley Correctional Facility, which is much needed, to allow for 30 more inmates in the facility. I remind the Treasurer that in the Mudgeeraba electorate there are another 28,000 residents who do not live in the Numinbah prison and they are sick and tired of his excuses and his spin about the lack of police in our area. This is an issue that the LNP will take to the ballot box. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018059"></A>
The budget made no mention of a new state high school for my electorate, even though the only state high school, Robina State High School, is very close to capacity. Each day 36 per cent of our children travel east to Robina, and with year 7 now added to secondary level one would have thought at the very least there would be more funding for Robina or a new high school announced for the Mudgeeraba electorate. This issue was also highlighted in my survey returns. It is of great concern, particularly for those families with young children who live on the western side of the M1. One of those surveys states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018061"></A>
I am a mother with 2 children in Yr 3 and Yr 6 at Gilston State School, currently without a gentle, nurturing high school option for my children. When can we expect to see a country high school in our rural area?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018062"></A>
Another states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018064"></A>
A high school west of the M1 would be of great benefit. I know a lot of parents at Clover Hill State School are unsure where to send their children to High School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

With the Bligh Labor government moving year 7 into high school, exactly where does it think children from my eight feeder primary schools will fit? Robina State High School will be bursting at the seams and there is a need to build a new high school west of the M1 now. The Gold Coast City Council has already identified land on Tolga Road in Reedy Creek which would be ideal for this use. Many residents have already signed my petition for a feasibility study into why we need a high school. This government already knows that we need a school there. The ridiculous comments from the former member, that we do not need one for another 20 years, are farcical when she herself lamented the lack of high schools in the Mudgeeraba electorate in her maiden speech in 2001. </Hansard-Body>

The lack of public transport, particularly east-west services, is another sore spot for the neglected residents in my area. I put on record the comments of some residents. One stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018069"></A>
Public transport is grossly inadequate in our area. Even cabs are difficult if trying not to drink and drive.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018070"></A>
Another stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018072"></A>
Price, availability and accessibility of public transport. It is inefficient when it should be the primary transport for school-age children to school. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Finally, I come to the latest hot potato that I warn the Premier and Treasurer will become an election issue: the proposed Boral quarry at Tallebudgera Valley. The residents do not want it and they are prepared to take up the fight on this matter. Another survey response states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018075"></A>
Stop the Quarry at Tally Valley. We built our house at Reedy Creek 3 years ago because it is a beautiful and peaceful place to raise a family, and there was no mention of a quarry being built. Please don’t let them ruin our piece of paradise.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018076"></A>
This project was announced as a project of significance, effectively bypassing council deliberations. This is a done deal, regardless of the smokescreen of environmental impact studies. Residents in Reedy Creek are well used to a Labor government foisting developments on them without a skerrick of consultation. I note that at the same time this project was announced the Minister for Main Roads waxed lyrical about extending Old Coach Road to the Bermuda Street interchange. I am positive that he is not considering this upgrade as a favour to me or the residents of Reedy Creek. Therefore, one can only assume that it is merely to provide access for trucks from the quarry site to the M1 in this done deal. I assure the minister that, regardless of the outcome of the quarry, the residents of Reedy Creek and I will ensure that he is kept to his word. </Hansard-Body>

I address the Appropriation Bill in respect of my portfolio responsibility areas of government services, the building industry and information and communication technology. I note that the minister is in the chamber. The massive cost of fixing the bungled Queensland Health payroll system is now an astronomical $208.7 million. This Labor government recently imported two payroll system experts from Canada to dissect the disaster at a cost to Queensland taxpayers of almost $350,000. Surely there are IT experts in Queensland or, indeed, within Australia who could have been utilised to rectify this problem. I note that in his report the Auditor-General stated the lack of a clear organisational structure within the project team which led to confusion over the roles and responsibilities of various parties. As the old saying goes, too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018079"></A>
In the past 12 months alone, the Queensland Police Service’s IT expenses have blown out by 37 per cent. The department of child safety’s IT system has now blown out to a staggering cost of $77.167 million. It is no wonder Queensland became a laughing stock when the government tried to apply to it the phrase ‘smart state’. The public of Queensland has a right to know about the current state of our IT services. We need to consolidate ICT governance in this state, as there is a plethora of committees and subcommittees that need to be consolidated or integrated so that we have a set of consistent and reliable metrics to measure the size and growth of our ICT industry in Queensland. We need to improve significant project controls and management. Currently, it is not clear which projects are underway, which projects have been completed and what lessons have been learned. We need a full register of all current ICT projects. We need to review how the government undertakes the management of its projects, which are then poorly delivered by employing an army of contractors instead of credentialled and experienced local companies.</Hansard-Body>

This week’s budget forced the Bligh government into allocating funding for cyclone shelters five years after it was first announced by Peter Beattie in 2006, following Cyclone Larry. Labor has failed Queenslanders with its too-little-too-late approach to safety for residents living in cyclone areas. After five years of excuses and delays, finally there is a commitment to build cyclone shelters. A total of $60 million has been allocated, with $30 million allocated this year. The Premier was shamed into this announcement after the Abu Dhabi government generously pledged $30 million for cyclone shelters after Cyclone Yasi hit the Far North. The Bligh government’s continued record of gross economic mismanagement and failure to plan for our future meant many Queenslanders were left without adequate shelter during cyclones for the past five years, and only now, in the lead-up to an election, is their safety considered.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018081"></A>
Labor’s $85 billion debt means an interest bill for Queensland taxpayers of $5 billion a year, which equates to about $100 million a week and $595,000 an hour. Only a can-do LNP government will save Queenslanders money and deliver more services to Far North Queensland by delivering much needed services now, not after a natural disaster has occurred.</Hansard-Body>

In another monumental failure akin to the same bumbling background checking system that saddled Queenslanders with deadly Bundaberg surgeon Dr Patel, the government recently had a Croatian drug runner and robber, who was on the run from Interpol, working as a security officer at the Premier’s office. The huge farce of this situation could have been avoided by a simple Google search, which would have found Marino Katalinic, who is on the government payroll as a high-level security officer--patrolling ministerial offices and our courts--is actually on Interpol’s most wanted list. </Hansard-Body>

The fact that a serious criminal who is wanted across the globe could be employed as a senior protective officer speaks volumes about the slack and bungling procedures in place under this long-term Labor government. The government failed to carry out even simple background checks, and that failure is what also gave us the suffering and deaths caused by Dr Patel. This could have been avoided with proper background checks. They include cost-neutral checks with a few simple tick boxes such as Facebook: check. Google search: check. Australia’s most wanted: check. Interpol’s most wanted: check. It is a disturbing joke that this government is now trying to blame Katalinic for not telling it that he has been wanted by Interpol since 2004. Clearly there is a need for a full review of background and criminal history checks in government services. It is ludicrous that criminals on Interpol’s most wanted list can be overlooked.</Hansard-Body>

In 2003 this arrogant Labor government broke an election commitment and introduced the compulsory community ambulance cover levy to cover the black hole of money it lost to fund the Queensland Ambulance Service. Now it wants to remove the levy with even the Treasurer stating in his budget speech that the levy was regressive in that it had a proportionately bigger impact on people on lower incomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020146"></A>
The most sinister aspect of this Appropriation Bill is that it has not factored in a carbon tax, which this Labor government is committed to introducing to support its failing federal Labor counterparts. Treasurer Andrew Fraser’s budget is relying on revenue from a resources boom to meet its optimistic forecasts. The Treasurer, who is a zealous advocate of the carbon tax, also needs to disclose the risks and how it will impact on Queensland’s economy. At a time when Queensland families are already facing increased cost-of-living pressures and family budgets are being squeezed to breaking point, the tax could be the straw that breaks the state’s recovery. The carbon tax will hit every Queenslander, with impacts on ordinary Queenslanders including an extra $300 a year for electricity and a 6.5c jump in fuel prices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020147"></A>
The LNP is opposed to the carbon tax and it is the only party that can bring about change in Queensland. A Campbell Newman Liberal National Party team will work for Queensland, not for itself. We will forward plan and not live for the moment, like this tired, arrogant, out-of-touch, on-the-nose Bligh Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_112228" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Buderim--LNP) (11.22 am): I rise to respond to the budget speech delivered on Tuesday by the state Treasurer. Further, I want to speak on behalf of Queenslanders. The people of Queensland have suffered yet another budget year under this Labor state government, but it is in Labor’s DNA to make Queenslanders suffer. The first thing I would like to speak about is the Treasurer’s budget speech. The Treasurer squibbed the speech; his heart just was not in it. The Treasurer’s lack of commitment to his speech was astounding. I think the Treasurer has finally realised that the game is up; there is nowhere for Labor to hide--in Queensland or, indeed, Australia. The Treasurer was standing over there a little bit like General Custer; he knows it is his last stand. The Treasurer really needs to pump up and put some real effort into this budget sell. He needs to really try to convince Queenslanders that Labor cares, but he realises that Labor is gone in Queensland.</A></Hansard-Body>

On Tuesday the Treasurer spent half an hour rehearsing this Labor government’s obituary in this place. I heard the Treasurer on the radio the same afternoon. It was a very downbeat member for Mount Coot-tha. The Treasurer told us very unconvincingly that Queensland is on the launch pad and is about to go rocketing off into the future. I am not sure what planet he thinks he is heading for, but the Treasurer did indicate in his speech that we are rocketing to the same place we were in his last budget--a surplus in 2015-16 perhaps. But then, of course, the Treasurer’s rocket is yet to suffer Labor’s carbon tax, a carbon tax that is in its DNA. I am going to reflect upon some of the words spoken by the state Treasurer during his speech on 8 June last year. The Treasurer said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020157"></A>
As global markets continue to shudder, we stand steadfast and determined. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020158"></A>
For we know that our task today in 2010 remains as pressing as it was in 2009. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020159"></A>
We must build, nurture and drive our economic recovery. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1020160"></A>
The Treasurer continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020162"></A>
We must prepare for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020163"></A>
It is our desire to protect the lifestyle and livelihood of Queensland families that fuels our determination to deliver on our reforms. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1020165"></A>
Despite the Treasurer’s assurances, the Queensland Council of Social Service’s cost-of-living report released last month reveals that both Queenslanders’ lifestyle and livelihoods are under threat as a result of this Labor state government. Remember, this report refers to Queensland. The very first paragraph of this report states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020167"></A>
There is widespread community concern over the rising cost of living. More and more households are reporting difficulty paying higher prices for essential items--housing, food, electricity, water, and transport. For many households it seems that prices are rising too fast, yet this belief is seemingly at odds with the modest 3.3% increase in the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the last year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020168"></A>
The QCOSS report shows the cost impacts on the basic standard of living in Brisbane over the last five years, from March 2006 to March 2011. It highlights the following increases: food up by 23 per cent; rent up by 35 per cent; public transport up by 48 per cent; insurance up by 40 per cent; electricity, gas and water up by a massive 63 per cent. Despite the Treasurer’s noble statement in last year’s speech that, ‘Twelve months ago, this government took the decision to fight for jobs, above all else,’ in fact, the very costs of just getting to a job and back home again have gone through the roof, whether people drive a vehicle or use public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020170"></A>
The only thing that this Treasurer has secured in this budget is the debt. Debt is increasing despite his asset sales. In fact, the maximum projected debt is higher than was originally forecast when the asset sales were proposed in 2009-10. The interest on that debt will be $595,000 per hour. Debt is blowing out to $2.127 billion and $4.058 billion for this coming budget year. Far from protecting Queenslander’s lifestyles, this government has added dramatically to the cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020171"></A>
With an election around the corner, Labor has decided to ban its government owned electricity distribution companies, Energex and Ergon, passing on to consumers more than $70 million in flood and Cyclone Yasi damage bills. The Australian Competition Tribunal decided that companies could collectively charge an additional $543 million during the current regulatory period, which runs until 2015. This Labor government has decided it will not allow Energex or Ergon to pass on these higher network prices to retail customers. Why? Because there is an election in the wind and it is in Labor’s DNA to deceive. So in an effort to win back some voters, this government is stopping the GOC’s from charging higher prices. This is clearly an election stunt. But any stunt that the Minister for Energy, Stephen Robertson, and the state Treasurer might like to try on Queenslanders is hanging by a thread because Labor’s carbon tax is on its way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020174"></A>
The government’s Q2 target delivery plan 2010-2011 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020176"></A>
... Queensland exports to the world, primarily in key commodity areas. The coal mining industry is Queensland’s largest exporting industry accounting for almost two-thirds ($37.5 billion) of the total value of goods exported overseas in 2008-09. Other major export industries include processed foods, metal products, metal ore mining, and machinery and equipment manufacturing. Japan is Queensland’s major trading partner followed by the European Union, India and the Republic of Korea. India and China are emerging as new markets for Queensland due to their strong economic performance and increasing demand for resources.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020177"></A>
However, the carbon tax will be a reality if Labor has its way. Labor’s mining tax--and then there is the carbon tax--will cost jobs; it is in Labor’s DNA. The Queensland government is all for a carbon tax. I note that a Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry report stated that Labor’s state government regulation cost the Queensland economy $6.6 billion in 2009-10, a 13.5 per cent or $780 million increase on the previous year. During this period, 7,928 pages of new and amended legislation were added to the statute books. I also note that the Treasurer is quoted in a BRW article from November saying that regaining the AAA credit rating will take five years and he reaffirmed that the budget will not break into surplus until 2015-16. That is the same 2015-16 planet that that Treasurer said we were ‘rocketing’ to on Tuesday.</Hansard-Body>

Last weekend the Treasurer was quoted in a media release referring to the 277,000 homes that have availed themselves of the ClimateSmart program. Let me quote the Treasurer--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

So far, more than 277,000 Queenslanders ...<Hansard-Italic>
 </Hansard-Italic>
have made the green switch by signing up to install money-saving ClimateSmart technology ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1020212"></A>
The media release stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020214"></A>
Queenslanders will receive even more money-saving devices to help knock-down their household bills ... Mr Fraser said the Bligh Government will invest $34.5 million in this year’s budget, as part of a $60 million extension of the program to December 2012, to help more Queenslanders make their homes ClimateSmart. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020215"></A>
Last year the Treasurer also made reference to ‘a sustainable future by doing the bright thing’. I have a question for both the Treasurer and the Premier regarding the ClimateSmart program, the solar rebate scheme and the costs to date. In late May, a Camp Hill resident received a letter bearing the Premier’s signature and thanking them for installing a solar water heater. Accompanying the Premier’s letter was a sign of about A4 size made from all-weather material like a pool resuscitation sign. The sign displayed the Queensland government logo. The Premier’s letter suggested that they might like to display the sign and show where they are ‘doing the bright thing’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020217"></A>
The Minister for Energy and Water Utilities stated yesterday that 17,800 Queenslanders have already received the solar rebate. Is it the case that 17,800 of these signs have been produced? If not, how many have been produced and what is the total estimated cost and postage of these signs? Where were they made? I just happen to have one here with me. This is the sign. If people put them on their fences, they will make great advertising for the government, I am sure! One thing is for sure: this stunt has been an absolute failure. I have not seen one of the Premier’s signs hanging on a fence anywhere. Again, I think it is money badly spent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020218"></A>
How much of the $60 million allocated in this year’s budget for ClimateSmart will be eaten up by stunts similar to this one? It is reported that under the expanded program from 4 July households who sign up will receive a standby power eliminator, which is a new initiative. They will also receive a temperature adjustment to hot-water system thermostats to increase efficiencies and reduce water-heating bills which is also a new part of the scheme. They will also receive a wireless power monitor and a low-flow shower rose, as they did under the scheme previously. I understand that they will receive up to five compact fluorescent lamps installed to their light fittings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020219"></A>
But hold the phone. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme prior to this budget, people who signed up to the scheme would see an electrician supply and install 15 compact fluorescent lamps in the residence, not five. So this new funding for the ClimateSmart initiative is actually dudding the homeowner. They are cutting the number of CFLs from 15 to five per household. This is obviously robbing Peter to pay Paul--introduce a couple of new initiatives to a scheme and cut back on other initiatives to fund it. That is the Labor way. The Treasurer was quoted further as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020222"></A>
This is a great achievement for the environment and shows that Queenslanders want to do the right thing and run their households more sustainably to reduce their carbon footprint. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020223"></A>
I quote the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities from <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 on 9 June last year. When speaking about the current state budget, the minister said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020225"></A>
Our government has a plan to turn Queensland into the solar state. It is a plan that will build a new green industry to create green jobs for Queenslanders. It is a plan that will allow us to reduce our carbon footprint and lessen our impact on the environment. It is a plan to move toward a renewable energy future for our state. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020226"></A>
There is the old reducing-the-carbon-footprint catchcry from both the Treasurer and the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities. It is the carbon tax war cry. The Treasurer and the minister and the rest of the Labor government are all for a carbon tax because they just will not deny it. It is a simple yes or no. They cannot wait. But the Treasurer makes no mention in his budget about the effects of Labor’s carbon tax on Queensland in the future--not one little bit. We know it is going to cost about 10 per cent on everything. He did, however, have something very interesting to say in reply to a question without notice on Tuesday. In reply to a question from my colleague the member for Gympie as to whether this year’s budget took into account Labor’s carbon tax, the Treasurer said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020228"></A>
There is a proposal. It is a proposal to front up to the reality of climate change. Even those climate change deniers on the other side, even just the driest of economic rushes on the other side, should see the rationality in pricing a scarce resource. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020229"></A>
Labor cannot even make up their mind where ‘carbon’--and it is really carbon dioxide that they intend to price--fits in. One minute Labor portrays it as the scourge of mankind and that emissions must be reduced; the next minute we have the Treasurer referring to it as ‘a scarce resource’. I do not think they know what they are doing. Labor are clueless on the carbon tax except that the Greens want one, and that is no surprise because Bob Brown is running the Labor Party. We all know it. I hope they all salute him. The Premier should go to an election now and make the cornerstone of Labor’s campaign the carbon tax. But the Premier will not, because it is a policy that is dead in the water--a bit like Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020230"></A>
Remember over the years how people have said that politicians would come up with a scheme to tax the very air we breathe? Well, that is what Labor’s carbon tax is all about--taxing the very air we breathe! Further to the $60 million propaganda campaign funding ClimateSmart, the Minister for Environment and Resource Management also got in on the act. The minister said in the media--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020233"></A>
Each ClimateSmart home will now be able to save up to $480 each year on their power bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 2.5 tonnes of a year ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020234"></A>
But a fact which seems to be lost on the minister is that paying for the $60 million allocated in this budget to this scheme will eat up the alleged savings consumers will make on their power bills, because electricity consumers, believe it or not, are taxpayers. The $60 million has to come from somewhere! Oh, that is right: they are going to do away with the community ambulance levy, which was originally forced upon electricity consumers by a Labor government, and the opposition opposed it. The Commissioner of the Queensland Ambulance Service will be quivering knowing that the Treasurer has just put a multimillion dollar stake through the heart of his organisation’s budget. Buried deep in the Budget Highlights is the following piece of information--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020236"></A>
In 2011-12 the Government will help with the cost of living through the following programs: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020237"></A>
One of those programs is to spend ‘$411 million to ensure all regional and rural Queenslanders don’t pay more for electricity than those in cities’. This is the subsidy that is paid to Ergon Energy to keep electricity prices the same as they are in Energex’s area. But the way this subsidy is delivered actually gives Ergon Energy a monopoly on their regional customers. As such, it prevents the customers from enjoying a competitive choice in a retailer as do customers in Energex’s distribution area. As we know, Ergon Energy and Energex are both government owned and therefore their profits or losses are those of the Queensland government. The maximum electricity tariffs are set by the Queensland Competition Authority, which takes into account the cost of distribution, the cost of energy--that is, generation--and the cost of retailing. The higher cost of electricity in regional Queensland is primarily due to higher distribution, not energy, costs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020238"></A>
Unlike Energex, which is only a distributor, Ergon Energy is both a retailer and a distributor. The subsidy is given to Ergon Energy to ‘equalise’ its tariffs to those in Energex’s area. But, despite the higher cost coming primarily from distribution, no distinction is made between energy and distribution. So no other retailer can compete in Ergon’s area because it has artificially low overall tariffs--that is, distribution, energy and retailing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020239"></A>
I am advised that it also exposes the Queensland government to the volatility of wholesale energy. For example, if there is a hot summer--like there could be next year--and energy costs are very high, so will the required subsidy be. I hope the Premier has taken that into account. That is unlike South-East Queensland, where this risk is borne by privately owned retailers such as Origin and AGL. Labor wants forgiveness from the voters, but the kind of economic vandalism forced upon us by Labor is unforgivable. It is in Labor’s DNA. As a result of Labor’s economic vandalism, on 1 July electricity will go up by a further 6.6 per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022673"></A>
On Tuesday afternoon, the Treasurer was on Brisbane radio. When speaking about the stopping of the transfer discount as opposed to the halting of the ambulance levy, he said that 1.4 million people would benefit every three months at electricity bill time from the cessation of the ambulance levy as opposed to the 45,000 who availed themselves of the real estate transfer discount. So 1.4 million as opposed to 45,000--some might say that is a reasonable argument. If the Treasurer is so concerned about favouring the majority for the greater good to the electorate, why doesn’t he repeal the 8c per litre tax on fuel he introduced 12 months ago? Just imagine, Treasurer, how many litres of fuel are sold yearly in Queensland multiplied by 8c. Then he would really be sticking up for Queenslanders, wouldn’t he.</Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022676"></A>
What about the Treasurer’s scheme of $140 million in grants of $10,000 for people who build or buy over a six-month period from 1 August to election day? This is what it is about. This equates to 14,000 new homes, but Labor is doing away with the transfer discount for existing homeowners who choose to move. They might be able to build a new home, but they will not be able to afford water, electricity, stamp duty, petrol and public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022677"></A>
As we know, there is a great deal of pain in accepting the Labor DNA needle at the ballot box, but there is a lot more pain to come when Labor introduces its carbon tax. This carbon tax is on its way. At $20 a tonne, it will force up the cost of electricity by 10 per cent. At $40 a tonne--like the Labor leader, Bob Brown, states--electricity will go up by 20 per cent. Do Labor members know what that will do to aluminium? It will destroy the industry in this country. It takes a lot of power to melt aluminium. Labor members might not have caught on to that yet, but that is how it is done--they use good old electricity. If electricity goes up by 20 per cent, guess where the jobs will go? They will not be here in Queensland anymore. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022678"></A>
Labor members have just physically killed one industry, but we can multiply that across the whole of Australia because that is what their good old mate Bob Brown is up to. Labor are backing him to the tilt. They want a carbon tax. Just like the Premier asked of Campbell Newman this morning, the simple question is this: will you say yes or no? You do not have the heart for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022679"></A>
Before I finish, I would love to thank the shadow Treasurer and member for Clayfield. What an effort he put up yesterday. He cut Labor to pieces. I think Labor needs to start looking for a new Treasurer because the current Treasurer cannot cut it. You guys cannot cut it, you are on your knees, you are clutching at straws. Your day is coming, I can assure you of that. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_114211" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Barron River--ALP) (11.42 am): I rise to support the Appropriation Bill 2011. Following the floods and cyclones that devastated so much of Queensland, the top priority of this government has been to rebuild Queensland. This budget reflects that priority and confirms the scale of the economic impact on state revenue and outlays. In short, revenue has gone down and the expense of repair and rebuilding has been added to the budget equation. For example, coal royalties are expected to be $500 million down and stamp duty receipts will be down $350 million on budget forecasts. The cost of rebuilding and repair has risen to $6.8 billion. </A></Hansard-Body>

Of course it is not just the government’s bottom line that has been hit hard with losses of $6 billion to the mining industry and $1.4 billion to agriculture and an estimated $400 million in lost tourism revenue. These numbers set a very difficult task for the Treasurer. I think he has done a first-class job in targeting support to individuals and industry sectors in the most need. In doing this, he has crafted a budget that is Labor to its core: a $15 billion capital works program supporting 93,000 jobs, easing the pressure on household budgets and providing new economic stimulus measures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022687"></A>
Despite the hardships that we as Queenslanders have endured, this budget paints a very positive picture for our state in the coming years, with economic growth forecast to roar back to five per cent in 2011-12 and 5.25 per cent the following year. Business investment is forecast to increase by an astonishing 27 per cent in 2011-12, on top of an impressive 13 per cent growth this financial year. These figures give us all cause to be confident and optimistic about the future. The big challenge is to employ the right policies to distribute the benefits of the impending resources driven boom across our vast and diverse state. </Hansard-Body>

Madam Deputy Speaker, due to time constraints, I seek leave to incorporate the balance of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022689"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022690"></A>
Mr Speaker, it is no secret that far north Queensland has been the region most affected by the global financial crisis, the floods and cyclones and other external factors like an historically high value Australian dollar. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022691"></A>
Our region is still experiencing relatively high levels of unemployment but the trend is heading in the right direction. The annual average unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 11.1% in April and May 2010 to 8.9%.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022692"></A>
That’s why it was so important that this budget contained measures to support our key foundation industries like tourism and construction.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022693"></A>
Mr Speaker, the principal way that our government supports jobs in our $9 billion tourism industry is by funding Tourism Queensland and regional tourism organisations to market our destinations and promote our world class experiences. But Mr Speaker, events play a crucial role in tourism. Cairns has just hosted the inaugural Challenge Cairns, an iron distance triathlon event that attracted 2000 participants from 17 countries.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022694"></A>
It was, on any measure, an outstanding success.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022695"></A>
I am proud that our government has invested through Events Queensland to secure this event for five years. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022696"></A>
Our government recognises the importance of major and smaller events to regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022697"></A>
For every dollar invested by Events Queensland, $10 is returned to the Queensland economy. This budget effectively doubles event funding with a $85.8 million injection taking event funding to a record $175 million over the next four years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022698"></A>
This will mean more major events, more business events and more regional events and a major boost to tourism.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022699"></A>
In Cairns, we are backing this up with a $6.33 million refurbishment of the Cairns Convention Centre, and $9 million to redevelop the Cairns Port waterfront with extensions to the popular boardwalk and promenade from the Hilton Hotel to the Cruise Liner Terminal at a total cost of $23.33 million and a visionary commitment to contribute one third of the cost of the proposed Cairns Entertainment Centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022700"></A>
Mr Speaker the other major sector that has struggled in Cairns is the construction sector.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022701"></A>
The most recent figures tell the story: The total value of building approvals in far north Queensland in March 2011 was down by 37.7% compared to March 2010. Approvals for the 2010/2011 financial year to date are down by 30.6% and for the calendar year to date down by 46.8% compared to 2010.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022702"></A>
Mr Speaker that’s why we are continuing to support jobs in the construction sector through our major capital projects such as the re-development of the Cairns Base Hospital and Lotus Glen Correctional Centre and jobs associated with a massive rebuilding effort on state assets like our road network. But this budget introduces a new $10 000 grant for people who sign a contract to build or buy a new home between 1 August 2011 and 31 January 2012. This will deliver a major stimulus to our building industry which is yet to show signs of recovery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022703"></A>
And Mr Speaker we will have the people to buy the homes because our population is still growing and in fact is forecast to continue to grow very strongly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022704"></A>
The latest population forecasts have just been published by the Office of Economic and Statistical Research and show that the population of the Cairns local government area is set to grow over the next ten years by an average annual rate of 1.9% taking the numbers from an estimated 172000 in 2011 to 207000 by 2021 and 241 000 by 2031.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022705"></A>
If you add the Cassowary Coast and Tablelands local government areas which makes up the regional planning area of Far North Queensland, the population is set to grow from an estimated 255000 in 2011 to 298 000 by 2021 and 340 000 by 2031.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022706"></A>
What this means is we must plan for growth and this budget takes important steps to provide the infrastructure and services that are needed now will be needed in the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022707"></A>
Mr Speaker, one of the most rapidly growing areas in my electorate is the Redlynch area. In 2006, the centrepiece of my election commitment was building a new secondary campus to create a p-12 college at Redlynch. I am proud we have delivered on that commitment and completed construction of one the best equipped public schools in the state. The quality of the facilities and the teaching program has driven strong enrolment demand and this budget commits a further $4.9 million dollars for expansion of this state of the art and highly regarded new school and a further $400000 to expand the special education unit.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022708"></A>
Another major announcement of which I am especially proud is the $36 million commitment to redevelop the Cairns CBD bus station. I have been an advocate for improving our public transport and we have already achieved some great outcomes with upgraded fleet and recently revised routes and timetables. Mr Speaker this is a project that will benefit locals throughout Cairns who use public transport to access the city for work, shopping, recreation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022709"></A>
Complementing this investment is an allocation of $2.8 million to design and construct bus stations in my electorate. This commitment will provide accessible, comfortable and secure bus stations and implements the northern corridor section of the Cairns Transit Network plan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022710"></A>
Population growth also drives demand for other services like fire and rescue so I am of course delighted that we are delivering $1.1 million to acquire land and commence planning for a new fire station at Smithfield, in the centre of my electorate. I pay tribute to the work of our fire and rescue workers and I am delighted they can look forward with certainty to brand new fire station.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022711"></A>
Mr Speaker, road safety is one my highest priorities. So I am particularly pleased that my campaign for road safety upgrades on main roads in my electorate is continuing to bear fruit with $3.95 million allocated for safety measures on the Kuranda Range Road and the Captain Cook Highway.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022712"></A>
Mr Speaker, Cairns is suited in so many ways for cycling whether for pleasure, fitness or commuting to work. No wonder cycling is becoming so popular. We have invested in a range of innovative specific cycle safety measures on the main road network and contributed $4.5 million to construct the city’s first off-road dedicated cycleway which is nearing completion. That commitment continues with $380 000 worth of cycling infrastructure on the Cairns Western Arterial Road and the Captain Cook Highway.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022713"></A>
Mr Speaker there is no doubt that the rising cost of living is putting pressure on many household budgets. This is especially hard for pensioners and people on fixed incomes. The abolition of the ambulance levy and the increase in pensioner rebates for council rates and utility charges is therefore a timely and welcome budget announcement and will be a big help for people who are struggling to make ends meet.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022714"></A>
Mr Speaker the initiatives contained in this budget are responsible and targeted to industry sectors and people who are most in need.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022715"></A>
The budget highlights for the Barron River electorate in education, public transport, roads and community safety build on the achievements of the past and deliver new infrastructure and services for our growing community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022716"></A>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_114425" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Southport--ALP) (11.44 am): I support the Appropriation Bill and associated bills. This budget is first and foremost about rebuilding Queensland after the natural disasters the state experienced earlier this year. Fortunately, the Gold Coast avoided these disasters and the need to undertake the rebuilding which is required in other parts of the state and which is budgeted to cost $6.8 million. We heard complaints from the opposition about inadequate money allocated here, there and everywhere. I did not hear the members for Lockyer and Gregory, for instance, complaining about the $6.8 million that will be spent on the rebuilding as a result of the disasters. </A></Hansard-Body>

Notwithstanding the natural disasters, the state has had to ensure that the economy is recovering--and it is, at an extraordinary rate. Business investment grew by 13 per cent this financial year, far exceeding the 9 per cent forecast last year and almost three times the national result of 4.5 per cent. This investment will continue to grow and take the state to a new level of prosperity and economic activity. Business investment for the next financial year is forecast to increase to over 27 per cent and remain over 21 per cent for the following year. This is miles ahead of all other states; our nearest competitor is Western Australia, which forecast only 15 per cent growth in investment. Our exports will increase by 10 per cent and economic growth is forecast at five per cent for 2011-12 and then 5.25 per cent for the following year. We are on target to deliver 100,000 new jobs this term; in fact, the jobs growth over the next two years is forecast at 140,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022726"></A>
The housing industry has been given a boost in this budget, and young Queenslanders will benefit greatly. The $140 million Queensland Building Boost program will operate for six months from 1 August this year. Any Queenslander purchasing a newly constructed home or signing a contract to build a new home will be eligible for a $10,000 grant. This will be very welcome on the Gold Coast where there is an oversupply of newly constructed units. This initiative will go a long way to reducing that stock. First home buyers can benefit by $17,000. They will also pay zero stamp duty for properties under $500,000 and zero mortgage duty and thus keep the full $17,000--that is the $10,000 boost and the existing $7,000 grant. The $10,000 will apply to all purchasers--growing families, investors, workers--who purchase new homes under $600,000. Despite all the bleeding from the opposition, Queensland still has the lowest stamp duty regime for home purchases in any mainland state at any level of purchase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022728"></A>
In an effort to relieve the cost-of-living pressure, the community ambulance cover levy of $113 will be removed from electricity bills. The council rate rebates for pensioners are increased up to $200 and electricity rebates are up to $230. Concessions in this budget to help Queenslanders with health care, electricity, water and public transport costs amount to $1.385 billion. This package maintains Queensland’s status as the biggest provider of cost-of-living concessions per person in the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022729"></A>
The tourism industry continues to suffer mainly through the high Australian dollar and that does not look like changing any time soon. We have committed $85 million for major events over five years, and this will enable Events Queensland to secure new events and new tourism attractions for our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022731"></A>
Also, $328 million over four years has been allocated for building works and new classrooms, as well as additional allocations for new teachers and teacher training to move year 7 to secondary school in 2015. On the Gold Coast and particularly Southport, construction work continues apace. Major projects, such as the Gold Coast University Hospital and the rapid transit system, are major employers, and $175 million will be spent this year on the rapid transit system. It is amazing to think that almost all of the major infrastructure on the Gold Coast, which used to be a coalition bastion, has been built by Labor governments. Labor had to resume land and construct the Gold Coast rail line after the coalition closed the line in the sixties and sold off the land corridor to all of their mates. We heard yesterday the member for Condamine saying that the National Party had a 50-year vision. What a load of rubbish. I wish they had had a 50-year vision in the 1960s when they closed down the Gold Coast rail line.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025187"></A>
We built Skilled Park and Metricon Stadium, the home of the Titans and the Gold Coast Suns respectively; the Gold Coast University Hospital at a cost of $1.7 billion; the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project at $1.2 billion; and the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre. The Gold Coast is a major tourism destination and has been since the sixties, but it took an ALP government to build a convention centre in one of the main tourism destinations in Australia. </Hansard-Body>

Today we hear from the opposition and its voodoo style LNP economics that Campbell Newman is suggesting that the Sunshine Coast University Hospital will be raided of its funding. In fact, last night I received a call from a mate of mine who lives in Buderim. He said that the residents of the Sunshine Coast will not cop a raid on the funding for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, and sure enough that is verified by today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
. The <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 is highly critical and he was absolutely right--that this will not be copped by the residents of the Sunshine Coast. This is the voodoo economics of Campbell Newman and the LNP. This is a project that will provide 5,000 jobs for the Sunshine Coast, yet the LNP is happy to attack that and put that project in jeopardy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025202"></A>
The opposition seeks to make an issue of the huge debt of $52 billion growing to $85 billion, but it does not mention that the debt is serviced by nine per cent of the state’s income--a very manageable debt repayment program. I would like to be in that position myself, and I am sure that everyone else here who has a debt would like to be as well. Imagine only paying nine per cent of your income in repayment of an average mortgage of, say, $500,000. Every one of us would love to be in that position.</Hansard-Body>

Other budget items specific to Southport include $4 million for additional accommodation at the Southport Special School, $94,000 for maintenance at Musgrave Hill State School and $40,000 for maintenance at Southport State High School. Some $700,000 has been set aside for preliminary works at Carrara to relocate the Gold Coast showgrounds for which $60 million has been committed and which will turn Carrara, with the adjoining Metricon Stadium, into a sporting and entertainment precinct. Some $47.5 million is provided for recovery and reconstruction works on the roadworks in the Gold Coast region, $20 million to continue widening Olsen Avenue from four to six lanes between Melia Court and Smith Street and $3 million to commence construction of the Sundale Bridge cycleway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025219"></A>
I am also pleased to see an extra $1.79 million over three years for the Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth. This funding will go to the Jessica Dunne Lodge run by the Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth--a great organisation. There is a real need for this extra support in our community and it is an issue that people have genuine concern for, so I was determined to ensure that this was addressed in this budget. Jessica Dunne house will provide access to temporary accommodation and case management support to young people aged 16 to 25 years. The service will provide five beds and three full-time equivalent support workers and a coordinating position. There will be on-site support seven days a week.</Hansard-Body>

I commend the Treasurer on a difficult job well done. It is not a budget that he would have chosen to deliver, and that is evidenced by the $6.8 billion that had to be found to cover the disaster rebuilding and recovery cost. But as the Treasurer says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025229"></A>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_115347" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies) (11.53 am): I rise to support the 2011-12 state budget handed down on Tuesday by the Treasurer, Andrew Fraser. I want to commend the Treasurer for coming up with a responsible budget delivered in tough economic times. The Bligh government came up with a strong economic plan to steer us out of the global financial crisis and the summer of natural disasters, and we are sticking to it. We have had to make tough choices, but they are the right choices for the future of Queensland. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1025239"></A>
The Bligh government’s fiscal policies have ensured our budget will be back in surplus by 2015-16. Queenslanders are going to enjoy a prosperous future under this government. Our success has been further highlighted by the fact that Queensland’s economic growth is rocketing back to five per cent next year--the fastest in the nation--and 140,000 jobs are expected in the next two years. With one in eight jobs in Queensland supported by the agricultural supply chain, the Bligh government is building stronger agribusiness and delivering more jobs for the sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025241"></A>
As the member for Mackay and Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies, I commend the Bligh government’s commitment to growing livable and prosperous regional communities. More than $310 million has been allocated to support agriculture, food and regional economies in this forthcoming budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025242"></A>
The Queensland government is also investing in our regions. A good example is my electorate of Mackay, which alone has a $649 million capital works program announced as part of the budget package. This is a welcome boost to the Mackay economy in supporting health care, roads, emergency services and education. This $640 million capital program for Mackay equates to a spend of nearly $3,600 per person which is higher than the per capita spend in South-East Queensland--which takes in Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast--of $2,849 per person.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025247"></A>
Our capital funding also includes work on the $405 million Mackay Hospital redevelopment which is continuing apace, with $87.2 million included in this year’s budget for the project. Once completed, the new state-of-the-art facilities will accommodate all clinical and support service functions on one site. It will ensure that we can meet projected demands for health care into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025250"></A>
This year’s budget also provides $300 million for road repair works in the Mackay-Whitsunday region following the devastating monsoonal flooding and tropical cyclones. More than $41 million has been allocated to reconstruct sections of the Peak Downs Highway connecting Mackay with the Bowen Basin. In terms of the Walkerston bypass, $5 million in funding has been allocated to carry out planning and design for realignment. Detailed design is currently underway and it is expected to be completed in late 2012. Also, some $4 million in 2011-12 has been allocated for the $40 million Fursden Creek Bridge in Mackay.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025256"></A>
On the emergency services front, this government has also invested $700,000 to redevelop the ambulance station at South Mackay at a total cost of $1.3 million. There is $1.1 million to purchase land and commence design for a replacement fire and rescue station in the inner city of Mackay at a total cost of $6.05 million. A public cyclone shelter and multipurpose centre will also be built in Mackay to be located at the new state high school on the city’s northern beaches. This new multipurpose cyclone shelter will help make the region safer and more resilient than ever before.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025260"></A>
With a significant demand for housing in Mackay, I commend the Treasurer for providing a new grant of $10,000 on top of the $7,000 first home buyers grant which will be a great boost to housing stocks in Mackay. For a young couple buying a house worth $500,000, there would be no stamp duty and no mortgage duty. That has the knock-on effect of supporting local builders and local companies that supply building products such as Porters and Mitre 10 and retailers like John Donnelly and John Carroll Retravision. It will create a boost for not only the building sector but also the retail sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025265"></A>
The stimulus package the Bligh government is delivering centres around jobs--jobs for the people in Mackay. This will generate increased wealth for our community. Bearing in mind the limited time, I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

While on the topic of infrastructure, the Queensland Government is also investing more than $80 million over four years to racing infrastructure with a particular focus on regional areas. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025269"></A>
The racing industry will continue to receive this funding through the Racing Industry Capital Development Scheme to upgrade and develop infrastructure and facilities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025270"></A>
This year, $2.35 million has already been delivered to race clubs under the program, with $1.65 million provided to assist with urgent flood and cyclone remediation works. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025271"></A>
This funding is in addition to the $2 million already committed for the upkeep and maintenance of facilities through the training track subsidy scheme.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker, this budget puts first and foremost our plans to rebuild, replant and reconstruct Queensland after the natural disasters--we are investing in the future we know Queenslanders deserve.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Recovery in the regions</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025274"></A>
The Queensland Government has committed $10 million to the joint State and Commonwealth Government Rural Resilience Fund taking the total to $20 million. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025275"></A>
This funding employs 500 labourers under Operation Cleanup, in addition to funding programs to help clean up debris, clear waterways, build industry resilience, and provide support from industry recovery officers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025276"></A>
Another $7 million will support rural and regional initiatives over the coming years under programs such as the Building Rural Communities Fund which offers small grants of up to $10,000 to local projects as well as a further funding for the Regional Development Australia initiative.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025277"></A>
These funds support local communities--from $9,800 for the Far North Queensland Volunteers Inc to establish a Volunteer Alert system; to $10,000 towards therapy services for rural disabled children by using Skype video conferencing--we are reaching every corner of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025278"></A>
Further, the Bligh Government has committed $7.52 million over four years to the Queensland Regional Development Initiative to fund projects delivered by regional organisations that generate jobs and support local businesses.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025279"></A>
These funds benefit Queenslanders far and wide, with projects ranging from $85,000 toward flood recovery workshops in the Surat basin region, to $65,000 in my home electorate for a Green Industry Diversification project.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Science and R&amp;D</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025281"></A>
We are also supporting cutting edge research and development, critical biosecurity programs, and initiatives which develop our economic footprint.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025282"></A>
To drive productivity and efficiently grow the agribusiness sector, Agri-Science Queensland will undertake up to $110 million of research and development over the coming financial year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025283"></A>
Our research will deliver outcomes to ensure improved access to markets across livestock, horticulture and grains.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025284"></A>
Our beef and grains genetic research is world-class, maximising quality and profitability for Queensland producers. Our reputation to deliver ‘real outcomes’ from our science precedes us and with our extension programs we are delivering production systems improvements to maximise productivity. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025285"></A>
This all adds up to the best possible outcomes for Queensland’s agriculture sector.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025286"></A>
The $110 million agribusiness research and development funding is on top of the more than $413 million that has already been invested in capital programs to make Queensland home to the best science technology research centres in the southern hemisphere. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025287"></A>
This includes facilities such as the Ecosciences Precinct, a science centre of excellence with a critical mass of scientists dedicated to solving some of the country’s biggest environmental issues. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025288"></A>
The science on-site focuses on climate change, protecting our natural resources and environment, and developing ways to grow our farming, forestry, and marine industries so they are competitive and sustainable.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025289"></A>
Queensland also has the Health and Food Sciences Precinct where industry and agribusinesses now have the opportunity to access skills and technology in one location. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025290"></A>
The precinct offers a pathway to access a wide range of researchers and diagnosticians from national and international universities and government agencies. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025291"></A>
This enables more effective collaborations in developing new and emerging technologies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025292"></A>
The Ecosciences Precinct and the Health and Food Sciences Precinct contribute to Queensland’s growing reputation for scientific research and innovation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025293"></A>
Through Queensland’s first ever food policy we will also drive economic growth in the agriculture and food industries to reach the future potential of $40 billion in the food value chain by 2020. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025294"></A>
These initiatives are in comparison to the Opposition who offer no policies due to ‘exceptional circumstances’. It would appear all they are good at is harking back to the last election when they promised to slash our building program and sack 12,000 Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025295"></A>
In the absence of alternative policies, the Opposition’s 3% productivity dividend from 2009 is the only policy we can rely on. Such a measure would have seen about $11 million cut within my portfolio in the past 12 months alone. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025296"></A>
The Opposition’s only plan is to cut front line jobs leaving service delivery areas bare and to freeze the capital work projects which under our plan will drive Queensland forward.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025297"></A>
Campbell Newman states that he wants to get behind Queensland’s agriculture sector, perhaps he plans to door knock the entire west.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025298"></A>
In contrast to the LNP social experiment, the Bligh Government’s economic strategy is delivering more jobs, higher growth, lower deficits and lower debt.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025299"></A>
While the opposition want to rewind our building programs, the Bligh Government is investing in the state’s recovery by boosting investment in regional infrastructure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025300"></A>
People and education</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025301"></A>
I would also like to commend the Government’s investment in our people with education and skilling infrastructure a big winner in this year’s budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025302"></A>
As Queensland recovers from the disasters, new challenges are emerging. The resources sector is resuming its expansion, and the construction industry will boom as reconstruction efforts escalate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025303"></A>
The pressure on the labour market will increase. Put simply, Queensland will need a labour force to fill these jobs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025304"></A>
As such we are investing in infrastructure and programs that will allow us to meet skills and labour shortages.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025305"></A>
In my electorate, more than $17.1 million has been set aside for the $32.9 million Central Queensland Institute of TAFE Mackay Trade Training Centre and another $4.3 million for the Mackay high schools’ Trade Training Centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025306"></A>
I have also worked hard to secure $1.18 million in funding for a kindergarten at Mackay North State School at a total cost of $1.25 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025307"></A>
We are also delivering on training for the future of the agriculture sector with the Agricultural College reforms.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025308"></A>
With Mackay having a significant aged population, I commend the Government’s support of pensioners. This Budget will increase the maximum pensioner local government rates subsidy paid by the State by 11 percent to $200 per annum.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025309"></A>
I also welcome the increased allocation for the subsidy scheme for pensioners and seniors for their electricity costs to $115.6 million this year, to increase the subsidy to $230 for their electricity bills.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025310"></A>
The opposition don’t understand reforms to modernise--that is why they outsourced the leadership. Campbell is their idea of a modern thinker.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025311"></A>
However, modernisation is needed hand in hand with fiscal responsibilities. Campbell has a poor economic record as shown by the Brisbane City Council budget, rate rises and failed schemes such as City Cycle and the Clem 7 tunnel.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025312"></A>
Biosecurity</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025313"></A>
As we have shown in this year’s budget, the Bligh Government is not afraid to put its money where its mouth is by investing in biosecurity programs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025314"></A>
With Queensland having the greatest exposure to external biosecurity threats in Australia, we are boosting the frontline fight against animal and plant pests and diseases.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025315"></A>
For example, Queensland is taking up the fight for the rest of the country against red imported fire ants--we do not want this invasive pest to become part of our Australian way of life. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025316"></A>
For the coming year, the Queensland Government has contributed an additional $6 million taking the total for the joint state/federal eradication program to $21 million--Queensland’s share now totalling $7.4 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025317"></A>
We are also investing more than three quarters of a million dollars, which will be added to the $1.5 million from the Australian Government, to counteract the effects of the plant disease Myrtle Rust.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025318"></A>
This is to help protect Queensland industries that may be impacted including forestry, lifestyle horticulture, beekeepers and lifestyle tourism. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025319"></A>
The Asian Honey Bee program will also continue through Biosecurity Queensland supported by the $2 million recently announced by the Australian Government.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025320"></A>
To ensure reform in this area remains on track, we are also investing $3.5 million to deliver the Biosecurity Queensland strategy. This includes a single Biosecurity Bill which is landmark legislation for a risk-based approach.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025321"></A>
The Queensland Government continues to support programs that strengthen our ability to protect industries, and most importantly our lifestyle, from invasive pests and diseases.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025322"></A>
The Bligh Government is a Government for the future. It is forward thinking and forward planning. A modern Government committed to the recovery of the entire state. We are prepared to make the tough decisions to see Queensland continues to prosper. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_115916" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Kawana--LNP) (11.58 am) Today, as the member for Kawana and shadow Attorney-General, I add my support to the contribution of the shadow Treasurer, a member of the can-do team, for his budget reply. It was a reply that sets an agenda for the future--an agenda that the shadow Treasurer has urged the Labor Party to copy, because our can-do plan, if implemented tomorrow, would provide immediate downward pressure on the cost-of-living expenses for Queenslanders. Costs-of-living pressures is one, if not the biggest, issue facing Queenslanders at present. For over 10 years Queenslanders have seen their car registration skyrocket, their fuel expenses skyrocket and their electricity prices skyrocket. They were faced with forced council amalgamations and told, ‘You’ll have a better regional body representing your interests.’ The government took control of the water assets and now our water bills have increased so much so that people simply cannot afford to pay them. This is the sad reality that is faced by so many Queenslanders and so many of my constituents living in the Kawana electorate. </A></Hansard-Body>

This year’s budget is yet another example of Labor’s mismanagement of our state finances--taxes paid on the back of a hard day’s work by Queenslanders. The government has gone bankrupt on the back of a massive mining boom. In fact, if a business was run like this state is run, the bank would send in the receivers. The government wasted the money in the good times and failed to invest in the future of our state. The government is absolutely addicted to spending and waste. It is addicted to debt. Like any drug junkie, the fire sale of some of Queensland’s major assets gave the government a little hit, but, like drug addiction, debt will continue to rise. For the financial year 2011-12, state debt is expected to surpass $65 billion and increase to almost $85 billion by 2014-15. That increase is despite the assurances of the Treasurer that the proceeds of the asset sales were to retire state debt. This is the same asset sale that those members opposite failed to disclose to the electorate before the last election and then sneakily announced after the votes were cast. That was a deception of the highest order. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 People in the electorate of Morayfield are hurting, because of that member’s vote over the past 2 years to continually increase the cost-of-living pressures in the electorates of Morayfield and right around the Sunshine Coast. People are hurting because of the cost-of-living expenses for vital services such as electricity and water, which is eroding the discretionary spending capacity of Queensland consumers. That means a downturn in retail, which obviously affects the retail employment sector and also causes a dramatic collapse in GST revenue which, of course, flows back into state government coffers. This downturn then affects the government’s ability to increase services and invest in capital infrastructure that maintains our standard of living as the population increases and infrastructure demand is put to the test. </Hansard-Body>

Thankfully, it is not all doom and gloom. Queensland has an opportunity to change Queensland’s economic prosperity and fortunes and make Queensland No. 1 again. The answer is simple: Campbell Newman and the can-do LNP team, which has a plan to restore Queensland to being Australia’s No. 1. Queensland has a proud history--a time that Queenslanders have held dear to their hearts--of economic prosperity and wealth. That has gone under Labor, but it will come back under an LNP team. The next election will be a contest between a tired, stale, arrogant, long-term Labor government that has run Queensland into the ground and the vibrant energy of Campbell Newman and a can-do LNP team that will govern for all of Queenslanders and not for ourselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025383"></A>
I say to the people of Queensland that if they want to reduce their cost-of-living expenses, they have to change the government. If they want to live in a state that leads the way in our national economy, they have to change the government. If they want to improve the justice system, restore order and put the sense back into sentencing, they have to change the government. If they want to improve our education services, they have to change the government. If they want to improve health services and reduce hospital waiting times, they have to change the government. The message is simple and the contrast between Labor and the LNP is stark: we will govern for Queensland and Queenslanders, not for ourselves and we will make Queensland No. 1 again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025384"></A>
The LNP has a can-do plan for Queensland and it is appropriate, as we continue to release the details of those plans in the lead-up to the next state election, to reiterate some of the key initiatives that the shadow Treasurer announced in his contribution and remind members opposite that their days of inaction and lack of planning for Queensland are numbered. The can-do team has a plan to slash the cost-of-living expenses and save average Queensland families around $250 to $330 a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025385"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Ryan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 What is it?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025386"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Morayfield screeches from the back, ‘What’s the plan?’ He should know a lot of the plan, because the government has copied most of it over the past 12 weeks. He should be well and truly on top of the LNP plans. We have already announced that in government the LNP will freeze the cost of car registration for the family car during the first term. Campbell Newman has also announced a four-point plan to address skyrocketing costs and put some accountability back into the system. The plan was so good that it forced the government to act and copy parts of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025387"></A>
The problem is that those members on that side of the House do not have the ability or the record to deliver any program competently or efficiently. We will reform electricity tariffs and abolish the ambulance tax, saving average Queensland families around $234 per year. We will do this by immediately freezing the standard domestic tariff. We will abolish that ridiculous system that allows electricity retailers to charge Queenslanders more, even if they use less power. We have always supported the abolition of Labor’s ambulance tax and we said so at the time it was introduced. That is another saving of $114. We are also committed to working with the energy industry to provide consumers with incentives to reduce consumption. This is part of a plan and, under Campbell Newman, that is what we will deliver for the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025388"></A>
It is vital that Queensland gets moving again. We need to return to the days where investment was encouraged in Queensland--in fact, sought out by the state government--and Queensland is again the state of choice for private sector investment in Australia. As part of our plan, we will appropriately resource the Office of the Coordinator-General to ensure that it once again becomes the facilitator of major projects across the state--not another layer of bureaucracy as it is under the current government. Under a can-do LNP government, the role of the Coordinator-General is to get major projects moving and to streamline the process of capital investment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025390"></A>
The LNP will govern for Queensland and not for ourselves. We will stand up for the state first and not for our own political vested interests. We will fight to ensure that the mining royalties of resources that come from this state go back into investing in roads and infrastructure in this state and not on our southern counterparts, as will happen with the federal government’s mining resource rent tax. A Campbell Newman government will stand up to the bullyboy tactics in Canberra and fight for our mining royalties to benefit Queensland and not marginal federal electorates in southern states. We will oppose the carbon tax, which is going to impact on every Queenslander. In the debate on the carbon tax this week we saw every member opposite vote in support of a carbon tax--a carbon tax that I am sure will infiltrate throughout the electorates of the members opposite. The LNP will oppose the carbon tax, because it will increase the cost-of-living pressures on Queenslanders who can least afford it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025391"></A>
The ability for one to own their own home is still a goal that we want to foster and encourage. We want to address housing affordability issues by reducing unnecessary costs and charges that are so often buried as hidden costs of buying a house. In government, we will reintroduce the principal place of residence concession for stamp duty transfer. We believe that if you are selling your house and moving into another property, you deserve a principal place of residence concession. The government has taken that concession away from Queenslanders. That means that, in most cases, people will be paying more than $7,000 extra in tax to the Queensland Treasurer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028342"></A>
Queenslanders should not be made to pay for Labor’s incompetence. Queenslanders should not be made to pay for an incompetent Treasurer. Queenslanders are paying for the incompetence of every member opposite. Our teachers need better resources and assistance to improve the educational outcomes for Queensland students. The LNP will provide greater opportunities for young Queenslanders to improve their NAPLAN results by easing the burden on teachers. </Hansard-Body>

With respect to the Department of Justice and Attorney-General, there will come a time in estimates when we will hold the government to account. Labor’s budget has all but walked away from the modernisation of the Queensland justice system. What we have seen in this gross economic mismanagement is a failure to plan for our future by robbing our justice system of new capital spending and a 16 per cent increase in wages. The capital expenditure in the budget is already announced and most of it goes to the completion of a new Supreme and District courts building which is nearly complete. If members have driven past it lately they will know that. The Justice budget predicts that Queenslanders will be paying an extra $70 million in taxes, fees and fines. Despite the proposed increase of almost $70 million, staffing to our courts has been cut. Regional Queenslanders are some of the greatest victims of this budget, with access to justice in rural areas totally abandoned by the Labor Party. For over 20 years Labor has overseen a legal system, not a justice system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028344"></A>
I hold grave concerns for Legal Aid because at the moment it is funded by the trust accounts of lawyers. Legal Aid will be heading into trouble as we go from the worst economic management to even poorer economic management in Queensland. I hold concerns for QCAT, set up to be free-for-all, easy access to justice. When QCAT has to deal with jurisdictional changes brought about by the Neighbourhood Disputes Resolution Bill once it finally passes this place, it will have an additional burden which I am not sure it can cope with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028345"></A>
The Electoral Commission has been additionally funded in this budget. It has to be. We have a local government election and a state government election. It had to have increased funding to pay for Labor’s dodgy public funding campaigns. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 $30 million to political parties that can walk to the Electoral Commission and get $2 million in administration funding each year as Queenslanders go without. As Queenslanders are taxed more stamp duty, the Labor Party is filling its pockets. That is a beast created not by us; that is a beast created by the Labor Party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028348"></A>
We are serious about access to justice, so much so that Campbell Newman announced in Mackay that a can-do team would deliver a permanent coroner’s office for regional Queensland. This will ease the burden on regional magistrates. This full-time coroner was in fact a recommendation of the State Coroner in his latest report. This new coroner will ease the burden from Caloundra to Proserpine. This is what Campbell Newman does: he understands, he listens and if there is a problem he acts practically.</Hansard-Body>

We on the Sunshine Coast have been neglected by this long-term Labor government for some time. Our regional investment needs are strong for the future but are underfunded by this government.

 article, thinking that they are all slick, that they have won the election based on a front-page <Hansard-Italic>

 article--and to the people of the Sunshine Coast that the LNP will deliver the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. I have advocated for it for three years. I would not stand around and let any political party jeopardise that investment. </Hansard-Body>

I can tell the Treasurer sitting opposite that the Sunshine Coast people have stopped believing him. They do not believe the Labor Party in relation to hospital services on the Sunshine Coast. They stopped believing the Treasurer and the Premier a long time ago. They will never, ever forgive the Labor Party for delaying the hospital in the first place. An LNP government will build the hospital and will build it faster than the Labor Party. That is the commitment given by Campbell Newman to Sunshine Coast residents. It cannot be any clearer than that. I will continue to lead the protest of ‘hospital delay, no way’. We did not accept it at the time and we never will accept any form of delay instigated by the Labor Party, not the LNP. </Hansard-Body>

I have been successful in this budget in getting some much needed funds for the Sippy Downs community. A little over two weeks ago, 700 people from the Sippy Downs community put before this parliament a petition calling on the government to invest in school safety, roads and infrastructure. I am pleased that the government has invested in the Claymore Road expansion project with council to fund and get that footpath in. If state governments build schools, they have to ensure people can get to them safely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028369"></A>
Public transport has always been neglected on the Sunshine Coast. We have had the CAMCOS corridor, the multimodal transport corridor, and now we have the Coast Connect program. The funding to plan is not even there. Those opposite talk a lot. They talked a lot yesterday. The Treasurer talked a lot this morning about the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, but the fact is that the Labor Party has never delivered any regional infrastructure for the Sunshine Coast. To see this, one only has to look at the precedent set over the past 20 years. The Premier has been there only a couple of times. Once was to say hello to Jessica Watson. She sat up in the gallery with the press. She could not even face the residents of the coast to talk about these issues. The people know that the LNP is on the side of residents of the Sunshine Coast and that the Labor Party is not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028370"></A>
I am also pleased that, after advocacy by me and the Kawana State College P&amp;C, there will now be traffic lights on Nicklin Way at Thunderbird Drive. This is a great investment to make sure that those kids can come across from the eastern to the western side in a school safety zone. No other way gives them as much safety as a signalised crossing. I am pleased about those investments. I am pleased that we have put petitions into parliament about various issues and we have then received funding for them.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1028371"></A>
In conclusion, Campbell Newman and the LNP team realise the cost-of-living pressures that are being placed on Queenslanders by this Treasurer. People know that if they want to reduce their cost-of-living pressures they will not do it with the Labor Party. Certainly they will not do it with this Treasurer, who is the most unpopular member of the parliament based on the votes at the last election. They will not do it with that man and they will not do it with that Premier. They know that a can-do government under Campbell Newman has a plan to restore Queensland as the envy of all other states in Australia. The contrast between the two could not be any more profound. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_122010" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Noosa--LNP) (12.19 pm): I rise to speak in reply to the state budget for 2011-12 on behalf of my constituents in the Noosa electorate. I am always proud to speak on their behalf and in their interests. I am very pleased that the Treasurer is in the House at the moment. Upon returning to Noosa on Monday, the first thing I will be doing is sending a big thank you card to the Treasurer to acknowledge the allocation of $265,000 to--would you believe--the Noosa shire council through the Home Assist Program. That little line went into the budget. There is no need to take ‘Noosa council’ out and put ‘Sunshine Coast council’ in. It is a recognition of the inevitability that Noosa will get its council back. That will be the first cheque that we bank into the account. Other than that, there are no words to describe my level of shock at the parlous condition of the Queensland state budget. We all know that this is a Labor government that managed to go bust in a boom. That is an unprecedented achievement. However, the state budget for 2011-12 is the darkest side of the boom. </A></Hansard-Body>

My constituents expected a strategy from the government that was clear evidence of some plan to start paying down the state’s burgeoning debt. They are disappointed. The reality is that, despite the $17 billion in proceeds from asset sales--members will remember they were the deceptive asset sales that we found out about immediately following the 20 March 2009 election--the actual state debt has continued to grow. It is more than it was last year, despite having sold the family silver, which paid off a little bit of the debt, but it is a debt mountain. My constituents were expecting a clear plan to get the operating budget back into surplus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031089"></A>
With each of the successive budgets for 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10 and the 2011-12 budget introduced on Tuesday, the state Treasurer pretends to be the eternal optimist. He continues to tell us that good times are just around the corner. His plan seems to be one of two options. The first option is to simply pray for another boom, bigger than the last. The second is to hope that the corner around which those extremely elusive good times are loitering will come into sight soon. He appears to have lost sight of the fact that we are now talking in billions of dollars. The deficit for 2010-11 is $2.127 billion. The deficit predicted for the budget in the following year, that is the budget just handed down, is a staggering $4.058 billion. That is $4,000 million. That number is beyond the length of the standard telephone number. That number is beyond the number that the average person can remember. It is an unreal number, but unfortunately it represents taxpayers’ dollars. It represents the additional borrowing that this derelict and morally bankrupt government will add to its existing debt mountain over the next 12 months as it pushes Queenslanders deeper and deeper into deficit and debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031090"></A>
A strategy or a plan to reduce debt and get the budget back into surplus would have started the long road towards regaining the state’s AAA credit rating. That is the third expectation of the constituents of Noosa. Again, they are disappointed. The Premier, too, must be disappointed. Was not that a Toward Q2 objective which she shared with my constituents, but that now seems to have been dropped off the radar as a goal? Now it looks more like an own goal. Of course, none of us should be surprised, should we? Throughout Australian political history, a key performance indicator of Labor governments is that they always spend more than they earn. Another KPI is that they always run the operating budget into deficit. The third KPI is that they will always create a mountain of debt as a legacy for an incoming conservative government to pay off. Why should the Bligh Labor government not be true to this historically accurate track record of Labor? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031091"></A>
Unfortunately, this particular Labor government has lost the trust of the Queensland electorate, not just the trust of my own constituency. This has come about because of the feeling of betrayal over asset sales, which the electorate feels was not what they voted for at the last state poll. The electorate feels that this Labor government reneged on an implied promise not to sell state assets and went ahead with a fire sale of $17 billion of those same assets. Some of those assets were forests. This government promised to sell just the trees. This Treasurer sent a pamphlet around to householders promising specifically not to sell the land under the trees, but when the time came some of that land was sold unexpectedly and deceitfully. Queenslanders did not expect their coveted fuel subsidy to be converted into a petrol tax, but Brisbane now has one of the most expensive fuels of any capital in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031092"></A>
Of course, the loss of the AAA credit rating means that the interest rate on our debt mountain is higher than it should be. While this Labor government remains in office, that debt grows and grows and grows like Pinocchio’s nose and for the very same reason. The interest bill is now $595,000 every hour, 24 hours of every day, seven days of each and every week. The interest bill is a staggering $14 million every day, week in and week out. It is $100 million every week. It is $5.2 billion each and every year from now on, with no end in sight and not even an apology from the guilty party over there. Where does this interest bill finish up? It simply goes on, the mountain of debt becoming even bigger, because there is no credible plan to address it. Mount Debt Kosciusko a couple of years ago is Mount Debt Everest next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031094"></A>
Every disillusioned Queenslander should look at this document as an epitaph for the state Treasurer. Every Queenslander should view this budget as a legacy for the state government. Every angry Queenslander should be getting out their electoral baseball bat right now, ready for the next state election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031095"></A>
What would that interest nightmare achieve if this had been a responsible Labor government? I know that is a contradiction in terms. It could build a school every two days--a school that the Queensland people would own, unlike the seven being built under private-public partnerships. It could build a regional hospital every two weeks. It could build a major hospital every four weeks. It could employ an additional 70,000 nurses, police officers, firemen and teachers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031096"></A>
My constituents are very disappointed with this budget. The total of all the allocations provided in it, including all of the funding for the House with no Steps, stage 2 of the Peregian Beach State School being built under a PPP, and the second year of the Noosa Fire Station building project, most of which have already been announced, is a mere $11,148,879. What does that equate to? It amounts to 19 hours worth of the state’s interest bill. My constituents are valued at 19 hours worth of interest payments by their you-can-count-on-me Premier. While the Premier was on her feet recently, boasting about her rampant spending in the north--and I have heard Labor member after Labor member get up in this House in their speeches about the budget and talk about this--she talked about how much this represented per person. It was $3,700 per person in Far North Queensland around Cairns. It was $3,700 per person in North Queensland around Townsville. It was $3,600 per person around Mackay. It was $4,500 per person around Fitzroy. But what is it in Noosa? It is $198.73 per person! </Hansard-Body>

Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I appreciate the comfort of your presence. Over the last number of months I have been trying--and I am very pleased that the minister is in the parliament--to bring to the attention of the Minister for Main Roads the state of Eumundi-Noosa Road, particularly an area between Duke Road and Emu Mountain Road. More than anything else, this will describe to honourable members who are present the difference between what is happening in Labor held areas of the state and what is happening in the state seat of Noosa. There is a section of that road--not the whole road; it is maybe two or three kilometres--that is just breaking up. If it breaks up any more we may as well get rid of the last of the bitumen and get the Cobb &amp; Co. coaches back because they at least will be suited to that sort of road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031143"></A>
A couple of nights ago I had an opportunity to travel back to the electorate and return here the following morning. Just outside the Doonan Service Station, which is the area we are talking about, yet another huge pothole that a semitrailer could drive into had appeared overnight. Big hunks of bitumen were lying on the street--and this is the main thoroughfare into Noosa. They just appear and they are still there. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council is contracted to send repair crews there every two days. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council has said publicly that the road is beyond repair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031146"></A>
I again say to the minister--and suddenly the minister has gone very quiet--that according to the latest RIP, which came out earlier this week, no work is scheduled to start on this road until 2013. That road really needs something to happen to it a darn sight sooner than that. Just this morning I received an email--one of the many I receive about this road--from Grant Allan. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1031152"></A>

The other road into town is the Cooroy-Noosa Road. There is a black spot in the area between Tewantin and Tinbeerwah. I know that Main Roads has been carrying out a lot of test work. It has reduced the speed limit on that section of road. I know also that there has been an allocation for that road, and I thank the minister for seeing to it that some urgent work is being done there. That urgent work needs to continue. The last thing we want to see is the lives of any more people lost on that particular section of road.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031158"></A>
I want to turn to another little catastrophe that is wandering around in my seat at the moment, and that is the catastrophe of public transport. I have just mentioned the two roads that come into Noosa: Cooroy-Noosa Road and Eumundi-Noosa Road. On Cooroy-Noosa Road we had a bus stop--not heaps of bus stops, but just one bus stop--in that 12 kilometres and it was decided to close it. Many people came to me--including a young man who goes to the Endeavour Foundation, and this is his only method of moving around independently--and complained that the bus stop at Six Mile Creek was closed. I went and saw Rachel Nolan, who was the Minister for Transport at the time. She gave me a very good hearing. She gave me an undertaking in writing that work to replace that bus stop at Six Mile Creek would commence before the end of the first half of 2011. Everyone should check the date: it is 17 June. In that same letter there was also an undertaking that another bus stop would be built on Eumundi-Noosa Road just near the Doonan Service Station. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031166"></A>
I will explain how macabre this situation is. If the transport department decides that it is going to approve the bus stop, it goes off to the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, which then plans the bus stop. It even goes so far as to talk to the bus drivers to make sure that they are happy with the bus stop and the way it is going to go in. Then when it comes time to build the bus stop it goes from the transport department to the main roads department. I kept on following up with Minister Wallace’s department and late last week we received notification from the main roads department, ‘I’m terribly sorry, but you’ve got to go back to the transport department again.’ We found that these two bus stops would cost $200,000 each. I say to the minister that six mates of mine and a bobcat will go out there on Saturday morning and construct the two bus stops and the only cost to the Queensland state budget will be the carton of stubbies that we will have at the end of the second project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031168"></A>
I say to the minister that along 21 kilometres of the Eumundi-Noosa Road there is not a bus stop. It is deemed too dangerous for fare-paying adults to pull up at a bus stop on Cooroy-Noosa Road or Eumundi-Noosa Road. However, it is not deemed too dangerous for school buses to pull up in a dozen different locations dozens of times over the school week--twice a day--on exactly the same road. I talk here of older buses carrying kids who are going to primary schools and high schools. Is there something wrong with those kids? Are they not as important as everyone else? Obviously, they are not as important as fare-paying adults in the TransLink system. They are allowed to hop off the bus on the same road where there are no bus stops. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031171"></A>
The microeconomy of my electorate is driven by tourism, construction, retail and health services. So in this budget we have a six-month sop to stimulate housing construction. However, as soon as this is over that construction industry will again crash, beaten down by the massive, ongoing increase in stamp duty, enhancing the state’s overdependence on a narrow taxation base. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031172"></A>
I condemn this budget. It is a shameful example of incompetence in the worst tradition of the recently replaced Carr-Iemma-Rees-Keneally led New South Wales state Labor government and the Cain-Kirner state Labor government in Victoria. That is the model and the financial rule book from which no Labor government, particularly this one in Queensland, ever deviates. </Hansard-Body>

We have seen a predictably disappointing budget from the government this year. The budget contains a $2 billion deficit in 2011-12 which is forecast to grow to $4 billion. We are also seeing a debt that is projected to grow to $85 billion, even after the asset sales, with Queenslanders being forced to pay $595,000 an hour in interest, or $100 million a week. It is plainly obvious that this government is spending far more than it earns and it is doing nothing to restrain its spending. To add to that, this government is fully supporting a federal government carbon tax, and the economic impact of that on Queensland is nowhere to be seen in this budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034047"></A>
The LNP will oppose the introduction of a carbon tax because it will have a huge impact on business, an impact on the resources industry and an impact on everyday Queenslanders. Household costs will go up, and those Queensland families who are struggling now will find it harder under this proposed carbon tax. The LNP cost-of-living policy will reduce the cost of power and water for Queenslanders. The LNP cost-of-living policy will slash the cost of living and save Queensland families around $250 to $330 a year. </Hansard-Body>

North Queensland residents can well feel somewhat left out as they view this budget. Rural and regional people have much higher costs of living, particularly with transport costs for goods and produce and just simple access to services. It is harder. People accept it and rise above it, but greedy governments such as this one, with huge rising costs, make it much more difficult. This budget does nothing to ease the cost-of-living pressures that our families are facing. It does nothing to combat rising fuel, food, rego and electricity prices. It does nothing to help the people of North Queensland. With increasing regulations on rural producers, with the live cattle export ban and with huge problems facing the banana and sugar industries at the moment, there is a real level of despondency in North Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034054"></A>
Let me look at the specific items in this budget for the Burdekin electorate. There is funding for North Queensland Bulk Ports, and $19.8 million for the investigation and preliminary works for the multicargo facility at Abbot Point is welcomed. It is certainly good to see that there is a commitment by the government to fast-forward this project because this is the epicentre of so much development that is occurring in North Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034057"></A>
The Bligh Labor government has also set aside funding in its budget to buy more land at the state development area at Abbot Point, and that is welcome. As I say, it shows the commitment for this essential project. However, it is disappointing that it has not bothered to fund the water needed for that area. The Water for Bowen project is essential to the expansion of the Bowen region. I cannot believe that this government set aside money to buy more land but has not committed to forward planning to look at the big picture to ensure there is adequate water supply for that area. I would hardly consider this encouragement to parties interested in setting up at the Abbot Point state development area if the water is not already there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034062"></A>
People of Bowen have been waiting years for the Water for Bowen project to get past the stage of bureaucratic paper shuffling. Water is essential to this district, and if the Bligh Labor government is serious about wanting the region to boom then it should be looking ahead and funding this essential infrastructure. I know it is a case of which comes first, the chicken or the egg? But to encourage investors in the area the infrastructure must be in place, and that is the role of a government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034064"></A>
There is this huge expansion occurring at Abbot Point with the opening of new mining projects in the Galilee Basin. The initial expansion of 50 million tonnes of coal being shipped through the harbour is likely to expand to 230 million tonnes in the future. The bottom line is that water will be essential just for that expansion, let alone for new industries that will be encouraged to come. The region has been drip-fed promises by this government, which through its mismanagement of the bountiful resources sector continues to leave this region thirsty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The residents of Bowen will welcome funds for the Whitsunday Regional Council’s water treatment plant. Water quality has been of prime concern there, so that funding will be welcomed by the residents. It is also good to see further funding for the Bowen State High School trade training centre--$2.89 million of $2.98 million. Also, the Queens Beach State School will get a little over $1 million towards the kindergarten there. </Hansard-Body>

Funds have been allocated to continue the port access road, which we note. It is disappointing, though, that the 2011-12 budget has offered no specific funding promises to flood proof the Bruce Highway. I note the two areas that are major flood spots--Sandy Gully and Yellow Gin Creek. I can assure the minister that I will cheer when I see the priorities and the funding for those areas in place. That is a promise, Minister. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will leave that one alone. I will cheer when we see funding for those two major flood spots, particularly Sandy Gully. While I am on this, Sandy Gully has not even been noted by the Department of Transport and Main Roads as a flood spot. It is probably one of the worst ones, particularly when we see hundreds of workers frequently cut off trying to get from Merinda to Abbot Point because Sandy Gully is underwater. I challenge the minister that these are major flood spots and, as we know, this is the main highway up and down the coast. </Hansard-Body>

In the budget we also see this very interesting funding of ‘$1 million in capital grants to assist with the construction of the Burdekin Rural Multi-Tenant Service Centre to provide a safe and suitable location for youth services, activities and programs’. This is a great centre. It is really good. It has been well welcomed in the Burdekin. It is very much needed and is going well. The minister came to Ayr in April this year to open this facility. That was on 13 April. I was delighted to welcome the minister to the district, and I know that this facility was very much welcomed. So why is there still funding in the budget--this grand announcement of $1 million towards the construction? Does this mean that the government has not paid its bills? Does it mean that there are some poor contractors out there who have not been paid? Or has it just been put in for padding by a desperate government trying to make their budget look good? If it is a mistake, it does call into question the credibility of this budget as to how many other mistakes there are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034077"></A>
This morning when I asked the minister she seemed to be totally unaware of where this funding was in the budget papers. I remind her that it is on page 25 of the Capital Statement, Budget Paper No. 3, and it is exactly that wording. The Ayr and the Burdekin people do need an answer as to what this funding is about. If it is another $1 million for the Burdekin area, we will welcome that. But I seriously doubt that it is. </Hansard-Body>

Residents will get cold comfort from the axing of the ambulance levy from their power bills. Electricity prices will still continue to rise under this government, and whatever saving there was from axing this levy will be eaten up by those rises. One of the real hits in this budget is the abolition of the principal place of residence concession for homeowners buying established houses and units. As real estate agents will tell you, that is the majority of their business--people buying established houses. This will be a further burden on those wanting to realise the Australian dream--to have their own home. After 20 long years, Labor is still promising that good times are around the corner. The LNP will save you money. The LNP will deliver more by getting action on the basics and cutting waste. </Hansard-Body>

Coming from North Queensland, I believe it is great news for the north. I heard the member for Noosa decrying the funding spent per capita in North Queensland, and well may he. They have had it too good for too long in South-East Queensland. I say that coming from the bush. That is why I support 100 per cent $3,750 for every man, woman and child in North Queensland in capital works, compared to $2,750 here in SEQ. It is quite right that we get a better lick in the regions than they do in South-East Queensland. We do it tougher up there. We will do it a damn sight tougher if Campbell Newman gets his way with these tolls on the Bruce Highway. But that is a different matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

It is good news for Townsville and good news for North Queensland as a result of this Labor budget. We will help support housing across the area--and we do need that boost in the new home sector; things are very tough in Townsville in the housing construction industry. So I congratulate my good friend, my mate from Proserpine, the Treasurer, who knows what regional Queensland needs--and that is this boost to housing in the north. Coming back to roads, the lifeblood of the north--and do not forget that we will oppose Campbell Newman’s tolls on the Bruce Highway--</Hansard-Body>

In Townsville, there was good news for local motorists. On Monday I was at the intersection of Banfield Drive and Dalrymple Road with the member for Townsville. This is a really busy roundabout. The member for Townsville lives just around the corner from there and I drive through there regularly. She knows how busy that intersection gets at peak times, especially in the mornings and the afternoons. We have allocated $17.5 million as a result of the Bligh Labor government’s commitment to motorists in Townsville to solve that problem once and for all. I want to congratulate the member for Townsville. She is a fine advocate for that city as she serves in this place. She is doing a very, very good job at solving a trouble spot that has been there for many, many years. Congratulations, member for Townsville. I know that will be welcomed by the local community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036908"></A>
My good colleague the member for Mount Isa drives the Flinders Highway regularly into our city of Townsville. She will be delighted to hear that there will be two new overtaking lanes between Townsville and Charters Towers as a result of the actions of this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036909"></A>
The member for Burdekin got up and sprouted about the Townsville Port Access Road which is in her electorate. We fought for over a decade to get funding for that road and it has been funded by Labor at a federal and state level. It is good to see further funding in the budget for this mighty project. It will take a lot of heavy vehicles off local roads and open up the port of Townsville for trade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036910"></A>
The good news continues at the port of Townsville. We will have our initial tranche of funding for that cruise ship terminal that will really power Townsville along. It is not only cruise ships that will benefit; it is those naval vessels from the United States, Australia and China as well, because the Prime Minister was in Beijing last month inviting the Chinese Navy to visit Australia. This $80 million investment will be a great boost to the city. I hope they come and invest in our fine city.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036911"></A>
Another project which we started planning this year at the port of Townsville is the eastern rail corridor. I am sure the member for Townsville will agree that it will be good to get those heavy trains out of the city centre of Townsville and following the Townsville Port Access Road into the port. This project will also help the member for Mount Isa’s electorate. Bigger trains will come into that port and that will really reduce the load on that rail system. More importantly, it will add to the prosperity of the north and the north-west as we become major players in the national economy, and that is great news for the north-west. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036912"></A>
We are continuing with the $110 million duplication of the Douglas Arterial Road. This is more roads in Townsville thanks to Labor. The tories would not fund it; they walked away from it for donkey’s years. That is why it took the election of a federal Labor government, plus money from the Bligh Labor government, to do this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036914"></A>
One road that is close and dear to my heart, even though it is not in my electorate, is the Gregory Developmental Road from Charters Towers going north. I heard the member for Dalrymple talk about it in this place. I drove that road when I first became minister. We are going to invest close to $100 million on that road to upgrade it, and that is why we allocated $26.5 million this year for repairs on that road. This money will be welcomed by people across North Queensland. That road serves not only those good people who live in those areas but it serves important industries, like the mining and the cattle industries, as well as the tourists who drive it, the grey nomads. But I say this to the House: there will be no tolls on the Gregory while I am here. </Hansard-Body>

This budget has been framed in very difficult circumstances. Our economy and industries were just getting off the canvas from the GFC when unprecedented natural disasters struck another blow. Despite these setbacks, this budget, building on the hard decisions taken in previous budgets, lays the platform for our economic recovery. It rebuilds Queensland after the natural disasters, it provides cost-of-living relief for Queenslanders and it invests in our future. I congratulate the Treasurer and his staff on putting together a very good budget for Queensland in difficult circumstances.</A></Hansard-Body>

In addition to these broad objectives for the state as a whole, we have also been able to provide for a number of important local projects. Since I was elected just over two years ago, I have had four key priorities for the electorate of Everton: first, tackling local congestion; second, improving local schools and kindergartens; third, completing the new children’s emergency department at the Prince Charles Hospital in Chermside--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1036925"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is a project that I know the member for Stafford is a big supporter of. And the fourth priority is fighting for cost-of-living relief. I am very pleased to say that this budget delivers on every one of those priorities, thereby delivering better services to Everton residents, improving their quality of life and assisting them with their financial obligations. In the interests of time, I will include details of these initiatives in the section of my speech that I will incorporate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036926"></A>
However, prior to concluding, I must contrast the government’s thoughtful plan to assist our economic recovery and invest in our future with the opposition’s embarrassing and empty excuse for a budget reply. This is the third budget for which I have been a member in this House.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They are a shambles; I take that interjection from the member for Thuringowah. Year after year, I have heard opposition members use their budget speeches for what I call a ‘less but more’ approach to the state budget. They all get up, speaker after speaker, demanding less tax but more doctors, more nurses and more teachers in their electorates, less debt but more infrastructure in their electorates--the list goes on. They seem incapable of reaching the conclusion that, if you reduce government revenue, you also have to reduce government expenditure unless you run an unsustainable deficit--something they also rule out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036929"></A>
I had hoped that with the election now being less than a year away, we would get a bit more maturity from the opposition members. I had hoped that they would demonstrate a bit more effort in identifying what could be cut to pay for what they want locally. Sadly, I am again disappointed.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the member for Stafford; it is ‘Newmanomics’ at work. I am open to their ideas. I am actually one of those nerds who like budget speeches. Budget speeches are the best opportunity a government and opposition have to articulate their vision for Queensland and how they will achieve it, but again the opposition members have squibbed it. They claim to have a philosophy; maybe they are embarrassed to reveal it. But, in hiding it, all they do is embarrass themselves further. This government will never be embarrassed about its aims and this budget delivers on them. It helps rebuild the state, delivers help to those in need and invests in the future. It sets Queensland up to prosper from the next mining and resources boom, and it ensures that residents of Everton share in that prosperity.

Tackling Local Congestion </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036936"></A>
The biggest local commitment in this year’s Budget ticks off on my first priority--tackling local congestion.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036937"></A>
The Budget contains $4.2M in the next financial year as the first step towards a massive $91.2M upgrade to one of Brisbane’s most notorious intersections, at Samford Rd and Wardell St, Enoggera.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036938"></A>
My neighbouring members--the Member for Ashgrove and the Member for Ferny Grove--and I presented a petition from over 1000 locals wanting this intersection fixed sooner, and we are delighted that our communities’ pleas have been answered. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036939"></A>
Stage 1 of the upgrade will extend the left hand turn lane on Wardell St, approaching Samford Rd, from 30m to 115m. It will allow about 100 extra cars through the intersection in every change of lights, and will be completed this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036940"></A>
In response to the community campaign run by me and my neighbouring local members, the Government has also agreed to bring forward Stage 2 of the intersection upgrade by one year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036941"></A>
Stage 2 involves a massive widening of the intersection and increasing the number and length of turning lanes on both sides of Samford Rd and the other side of Wardell St. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036942"></A>
The upgrade will be finished over the next three years, a year earlier than originally proposed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036943"></A>
These improvements will make a huge difference to the daily commute for Everton residents, giving them more time with their families, rather than sitting in traffic. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036944"></A>
Improving Local Schools and Kindergartens</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036945"></A>
My second priority has been to improve education in my area.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036946"></A>
Of course, local students will benefit from one of the major initiatives in this year’s Budget, being the decision to move Year 7 to secondary school. This decision will extend Year 7 students, with an opportunity to learn a more advanced curriculum, in the right environment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036947"></A>
This visionary plan is matched by substantial funding to improve local schools and kindergartens.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036948"></A>
$200,000 will be spent in the coming year for planning towards a new arts centre at Albany Creek SHS. This school has a fantastic performing arts program, but currently has to perform in a sports hall.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036949"></A>
I am determined to get the funding needed for students to have a better performance venue, and this is a good first step towards that aim.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036950"></A>
The Budget also contains an allocation of $400,000 for Eatons Hill State School to address staffroom and classroom concerns.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036951"></A>
This school is one of the biggest primary schools in the State, and its continued growth has meant the old staff room has had to be taken for other uses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036952"></A>
Albany Creek State School also stands to benefit from $150,000 to improve its outdoor learning centre, and undertake repairs to the quadrangle.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036953"></A>
McDowall State School will also get $268,000 to extend its school hall. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036954"></A>
This funding will make a huge difference to the students and the teachers of these schools, and to the learning outcomes of their students.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036955"></A>
$75,000 will also be provided to childcare centres within the electorate to deliver accredited an approved kindergarten program and provide a flying start to children’s education.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036956"></A>
Completing new northside children’s emergency department</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036957"></A>
My third priority has been to see through the completion of a new Children’s Emergency Department at The Prince Charles Hospital in Chermside. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036958"></A>
Construction is now well underway, and this Budget allocates $32 million to complete this $45 million project. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036959"></A>
The new Emergency Department will be staffed by children’s emergency specialists. It will have 12 new emergency bays, 20 beds for short stays and children’s outpatient services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036960"></A>
When it opens in 2012, it will deliver first class health care to young families closer to home.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036961"></A>
Cost of Living Relief</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036962"></A>
My fourth and final priority has been to fight for cost of living relief for families and seniors in the Everton electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036963"></A>
This is one of the main issues raised with me by people in the Everton electorate, and consequently, it’s one of the main issues I have taken up with various Ministers, on behalf of local residents. I recognise that a number of my fellow Government backbenchers have done likewise.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036964"></A>
That’s why I’m pleased the Government has listened, by announcing a number of measures to relieve cost of living pressures on working families in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036965"></A>
Yesterday, we introduced legislation to bring in a new tariff system for electricity, which will charge people higher tariffs, the more electricity they use, and provide cost savings for those who conserve power.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036966"></A>
We also debated another Bill which limits increases to the water and sewage bills charged by council-owned water businesses.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036967"></A>
This year’s Budget contains a number of additional initiatives to help with the cost of living. They include:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036968"></A>
Increasing rebates and subsidies for pensioners and seniors,</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036969"></A>
Extending the Climate Smart Home Service--delivering potential electricity savings of $480 per household per year, and most importantly,</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036970"></A>
Abolishing the ambulance levy--delivering a $113 reduction to electricity bills for 1.4 million households and small businesses.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036971"></A>
All of these initiatives will deliver real cost of living relief for families in the Everton electorate, and indeed Queensland as a whole.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036972"></A>
Other Commitments</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036973"></A>
The Budget contains a number of other road improvements in addition to the massive upgrade of the Samford Rd-Wardell St intersection.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036974"></A>
$985,000 will be spent improving the intersections of Samford Rd with Pickering St and Taylors Rd/Prospect Rd, at a cost of $985,000.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036975"></A>
$1.2 million will be spent to deliver noise barriers on Old Northern Rd at Albany Creek. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036976"></A>
These improvements were committed to following a delegation of local residents meeting the Main Roads Minister at last year’s Albany Creek Community Cabinet.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036977"></A>
And $717,000 will be spent to commence traffic signal improvements at the Flamingo Drive intersection on South Pine Road at Albany Creek.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036978"></A>
These are all important local issues for the people of Everton and I’ve fought hard to have them addressed in the interests of improved road safety.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040328"></A>
The Budget has of course delivered funding for many other important services in the electorate of Everton. These include:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040329"></A>
$365,000 for the Corporation of the Trustees of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane to establish new services or expand current services to people with a disability</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The abolition of the ambulance levy, an impost that has burdened my constituents’ electricity bills for too long, will help many now struggling, and by doing so, help the economy. So will the increase in the pensioner rebate, which will help thousands in my electorate who are struggling to meet the costs of reticulated services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037004"></A>
The Moreton Bay rail link from Petrie to Kippa Ring remains on track in spite of the economic constraints on this budget caused by the natural disasters of last summer. Indeed $12 million has been brought forward to ensure that the construction is timely. The Federal Government, in the Federal budget, has brought forward a large sum also. This will ensure early progress on the project: Progress at a time of economic adversity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037005"></A>
Some of my constituents have drawn to my attention environmental concerns with the railway, for example, that the line passes through some areas of natural habitat, including koala habitat. This is true, but the government has the balance right. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037006"></A>
The line has been drawn to minimise the environmental impact. Moreover fauna crossings are being considered for strategic points, where remnant vegetation remains north of the proposed line. Personally, I support koala underpasses, which, I predict would become known as the ‘Teddy tunnels of Rothwell’. These would enable koalas and other animals to forage on both sides of the line.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037007"></A>
Perhaps, more importantly, the line will be an overall positive environmentally. It will take thousands of cars off the road in one of the fastest growing population zones in Australia. It will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037008"></A>
In the end, though, it is the human impact that is decisive. This railway will enable commuters to travel more quickly to town. It will enable people who cannot get themselves there now, like teenage job seekers and those elderly people who do not drive, to get there. It will enable some families who now have to have two cars, to make do with one. It will change the lives of the people of whole suburbs, and change them for the better.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037009"></A>
Another transport initiative in the budget will provide immense benefit to my constituency. When we drive home along Anzac Avenue at the wrong time of day, we inevitably wait for ages at the Rothwell roundabout. In this budget is $830,000 to start construction of new lanes at this intersection.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037010"></A>
This budget delivers the necessary funds for growth in our burgeoning suburbs. There is $22.56 million for Stage 1 of the new Mango Hill State School, and $2.74 million for Stage 2 of Bounty Boulevard. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037011"></A>
Mango Hill State School will open next year, as will the North Lakes Ambulance Station, after the expenditure of another $3.7 million this year. Ambulances and personnel for the North Lakes Ambulance Station are already operational and working from Deception Bay Ambulance Station. Their relocation to North Lakes next year will cut vital minutes off their response times.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037012"></A>
This budget also provides millions of dollars for improvement of services in the electorate of Murrumba, in the area of education, community services and disabilities. I will highlight details of these programmes in coming months.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Pensioners and the low-income earners in my electorate cannot cope with the continual squeeze on their low income, so what is this government doing? It has brought out a few bandaids to try to bandage up a few things. It is rebating pensioners for things like electricity, water and council rates because the government has lost sight of how to keep the cost of living low. The rebates announced to pensioners and low-income earners are just a drop in the bucket compared to the increases they have endured in the previous years--increases in car registration, fuel, groceries, stamp duty, insurances, actually everything. It is just all too much.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1037021"></A>
For just electricity, water and car registrations, Queenslanders have been slugged hundreds of dollars in the past three years. The electricity rebate increased by 6.6 per cent for pensioners to match the increase in electricity announced this month. However, while there is a 6.6 per cent increase in the power bill--and for a household that is an average of around $117--the 6.6 per cent increase in the rebate for pensioners means only about $15 per year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037022"></A>
I have a few questions from my constituents. ‘How can I afford the rent, electricity, registration, insurance and the heating and cooling of my home on a pension?’ ‘How can we afford the current cost of living as a pensioner?’ What will I do if my husband goes into high-care aged care?’ ‘I can’t afford to live on my own anymore.’ In light of this budget, they will be no further towards getting any answers. They are simply trying to keep everyday living utility expenses to a minimum. This is beyond this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037023"></A>
My electorate of Hervey Bay has the second highest population of aged persons in Queensland, only beaten by Bribie Island per capita. The aged population and pensioners of my electorate are very proud people. They come from strong stock with distilled determination so strong that they do suffer in silence--suffer the squeeze at the grocery store, suffer the squeeze at the petrol bowser. These proud people will turn their heaters and their air conditioners off just so that they can buy food.</Hansard-Body>

 As I was saying before the lunch break, these proud people will turn off their heaters and their air conditioners just so they can buy some milk and bread and pay the rent at the end of the day before they will admit financial ruin. I am here today to let the House know that pensioners in my electorate can no longer suffer the continual squeeze from the financial mismanagement of this tired, old Labor government. We all welcome the ambulance levy being abolished, saving $113. However, when we consider that electricity costs will go up by about $120 next year and have already gone up several hundred dollars since 2006 and then add the potential carbon tax to that, it is unthinkable. </Hansard-Body>

I was in local government in my previous life and I wonder what would have happened if Peter Beattie had got his way in terms of putting the ambulance levy on council rates. There is already the fire levy on council rates. We do not talk about doing away with the fire levy. If Peter Beattie got his way in those days, it would be interesting to see whether the ambulance levy was abolished. People blame councils for those things. People blame councils for the fire levy. This parliament seems to have made a real art of bashing councils around, but that would be very interesting. The sale of public assets has not made a difference. We are still going backwards. The budget deficit is more than $4 billion. How are we going to pay off this debt? It is like Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard, and do you know what she found? She found that this old Labor government had sold off the cupboard!</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044454"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This budget does nothing to relieve cost-of-living pressures. It is all just about spin, spin, spin. It is really getting out of control. The elderly in our community are suffering. The government might rejoice in announcing a few rebates for water, electricity and rates, only because it knows as well as I do that low-income earners have reached flashpoint. It is flashpoint and there are many old people suffering at this point in time. I see it every day, especially those pensioners whose loved ones have to go into a nursing home who are left home on their own. Those people are struggling and are not being insulated from the rising costs year in, year out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044457"></A>
Then there is the potential of the carbon price. The federal government will give people $10 a week to offset that. This proves one thing: without a shadow of a doubt, this is going to hurt. The carbon tax is going to really hurt many people, and it will hurt pensioners. They are not coping now in terms of affording the basic living standards that they deserve today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044458"></A>
Who is paying? We need to look no further than stamp duty, and I am concerned about that. Are people selling their existing homes to move into a retirement village going to have to pay stamp duty? When property prices are down those people cannot sell their house for the same amount as it costs to go into a nursing home or a retirement village. Are people going to pay this enormous tax on buying units in retirement villages? It will be interesting to see what happens with that in terms of people being able to afford to move into retirement villages. At the end of the day, it is a lot better for some people to move into retirement villages which have access to high care. When those people live out of town or miles away from where their loved one is being nursed in a nursing home, it is very difficult for pensioners to make it every day to see their loved ones because some of them cannot afford fuel because fuel prices have gone sky high. I feel sorry for these people because they are really struggling.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044459"></A>
Last night I spoke to a number of people about the gouging of this property tax, as we might as well call it. It will cost an extra $5,000 in stamp duty for a house in Hervey Bay. For an existing home, that will make a huge difference. When we put the carbon tax on top of that, that means an extra $6,000. The extra cost is incredible. Homeowners will have to be paying out and paying out again with the carbon tax, stamp duty and all the rest of it. It is just ridiculous!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044461"></A>
With this government it is just numbers on papers nowadays, and we only have to look at police resources. When I have asked where are our police, we have been told the same old stuff--that is, 6,000 extra police over the life of this government. As this House would know, I have been asking for more first-response police for Hervey Bay. Yes, last year we did get four police, but just wait: they took four away! An article in the <Hansard-Italic>

 titled ‘Snow job on police numbers’ states--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044465"></A>
This is how this government counts police numbers: it counts new faces and when the old faces leave it does not bother to tell you. Let us look at police numbers in Hervey Bay. There is about one police officer to every 1,500 residents and in some cases there is only one patrol at night-time. The police numbers in Hervey Bay are totally inadequate for the population.</Hansard-Body-Continued>

 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Another thing that is always taken for granted is our valuable SES workers in Hervey Bay. They are always looking for money to try to maintain their facilities and get things they need. They rely on the councils a lot in regional areas. We take these people for granted lots of times. We should be looking at funding these community groups better than we are, because they are a very valuable resource, especially given the disasters we have seen this year. I would like to thank all of those SES workers for the amount of work they do for us, especially the work they did during the floods earlier this year. I think we really have to pay our respects to those people.</Hansard-Body>

My electorate depends heavily on the tourist dollar. Last year, the government peeled about $15 million out of the tourism budget for Queensland. It would seem that the tourism industry has suffered a downturn of about $400 million this year. The Treasurer has come up with a big announcement about how to boost tourism with $85 million to lure the tourism dollars back to our regions. Why not give some relief to the accommodation and general business owners in Hervey Bay, who are paying huge expenses for their utilities and land tax? They cannot cope with some of these large land tax bills that have really gone through the roof over the past few years. As members know, the land valuation system takes an average valuation over three years to the present-day value of the land. The land tax bills are still very high. A lot of these businesses are struggling to pay these high land tax bills. We only have to look at the way land tax has gone up over the past few years--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Property values have gone up, but they have also gone down. With the system of averaging valuations for land tax, the land tax rate has not gone down in accordance with valuations. You want to get it sometimes. Those businesses have been forced to trim their budgets, especially their staff wages, and that means putting people off. I have had interviews with some of the accommodation providers and business owners in the tourism industry in Hervey Bay. They are saying to me that they have no time to grow their business as they are doing the hard yards and they are doing all the work themselves. They are cleaning the rooms and attending to service calls 24 hours a day just to stay afloat. A lot of them are going into the red and taking on mortgages and things like that just to stay afloat, waiting for the good times to return. Some of them are actually going under. I know that some restaurants in Hervey Bay have already gone under. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047643"></A>
We have to look at what small businesses are all about. There is a lack of understanding of how these small businesses are struggling at the moment, especially with the red tape and compliance costs that are just strangling business. It just goes on and on. To see this we only have to look at the pages of bureaucracy we pass through this place every year. It is just getting out of hand. The other morning one electrician told me that he has to do two hours of paperwork before he can even start his job. It just goes on and on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047644"></A>
I want to talk about the tourism industry on Fraser Island--the mismanagement of Fraser Island and the inability to repair some of the roads over there. There are a lot of road closures on Fraser Island. When people go over there, they cannot go where they want to go. The minister has no idea of the minimum essential services needed for the tourism industry on Fraser Island. The brand-new infrastructure at Lake McKenzie has been partly undermined by the rising waters in the lake, especially since the heavy rain. Some of that brand-new infrastructure has been ripped out and tossed behind a fence. Tourists can view that. Nothing seems to be done about the amount of rubbish that gets washed up on Fraser Island and it looks terrible. Some of the tourists comment about that rubbish. Recently, half a boat was washed up and it just sat there for months and months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047646"></A>
The management of the Fraser Island dingoes attracts so much media attention. Wildlife professionals locally and internationally have now stuck these electronic collars on the dingoes which weigh about half a kilo or more. It upsets a lot of the residents and a lot of other people to see this big thing with two antennas sticking up around a dingo’s neck. It really looks good when you see photographs of it! No reasonable wildlife ethics committee would allow it. It is quite amazing sometimes what they do. </Hansard-Body>

If the minister would like to travel around her own backyard, I offer my services as a guide. The minister is welcome to bring a compliance officer with her, with his infringement notice and ticket book, when she views the World Heritage listed Fraser Island so that they can gauge the penalties for an infringement of the minister’s management practices on Fraser Island. At the moment, the situation is pretty pathetic.</Hansard-Body>

We talk about promises and we talk about things in the budget. On 15 April this year I thought I would follow up a promise made in this budget for 16 community dental chairs. In fact, it has been in every budget since 2008--2009, 2010, 2011. Those dental chairs are needed desperately in Hervey Bay to reduce the dental waiting list. So when can we really expect an answer? I even asked a question on notice about the matter. The reply stated that the government was looking into it. The answer also stated that this new expanded oral health facility will help reduce patient waiting times and increase capacity to see more patients. No kidding! They sure won me there! But then the minister stated further in that answer that early planning and investigation works on the new Hervey Bay oral health facilities were underway. At the end of the day, how long is a piece of string? We have seen these promises in every budget. </Hansard-Body>

One of the consistent issues raised at both the district and Central Office level has been the absence of a service plan for the State. Queensland Health has created a small Statewide Planning Unit to strengthen its planning capabilities. However, the capabilities of this unit are not sufficient to meet departmental needs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1047667"></A>
It seems there has been limited coordinated service planning since the substantial work undertaken at the time of the Statewide Hospital Rebuilding Program. Districts in particular are concerned that they are potentially planning new services with no coordinated framework within which they can undertake their own service planning. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

... the audit identified fundamental weaknesses in current practices. These weaknesses include: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050900"></A>
I will paraphrase these: a lack of transparent linkages between statewide and district service plans; a lack of clear prioritisation of needs within district service plans; no clear linkage between service plans and implementation of the Queensland Statewide Health Plan 2007-2012<Hansard-Italic>
; </Hansard-Italic>
district plans are not supported by time frames or performance indicators; and that there is no monitoring, evaluation or reporting framework in place. </Hansard-Body>

One would have thought that the health department, following the Davies royal commission and the Forster review, would have taken on board at least the contents of the Forster review in putting in place a health service plan and a process that was transparent and linked the districts together. Yet we know by 2009 the Auditor-General in his report of June of that year highlighted that nothing had been learnt by Queensland Health or, indeed, this government and that planning had been taken on an ad hoc basis with outcomes commensurate therewith.</Hansard-Body>

There has been some discussion of late in relation to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital so I went back and looked at the history of the hospital. Some members were not in this House back in 2005 when the announcement of a new hospital was made by then Premier Peter Beattie. Actually the hospital goes back further than that--in part. In May of 1999 then health minister Wendy Edmond established what she called a task force to investigate Sunshine Coast health needs. That task force was to make recommendations on future resource needs for the Sunshine Coast District Health Service. I table a copy of that media release dated 17 May 1999 by the then minister.</Hansard-Body>

It was in April 2005 that former Premier Peter Beattie and Terry Mackenroth announced a new hospital for the coast at a cost of $500 million. Members will be acutely aware that the current capital statement for this hospital is $2.03 billion. That is up from $500 million and is an increase of $1.53 billion. Taxpayers money is going to waste yet again because of this government. I table a copy of the media release by the then Premier dated 27 April 2005 for the benefit of the House wherein the initial announcement was made.</Hansard-Body>

In June 2008 the state budget suddenly reveals the cost of the hospital had gone from $940 million to $1.2 billion. So we start with $500 million in 2005 and by June 2008 it had gone to $1.2 billion--a blowout of $700 million. In August of 2008 the then health minister Stephen Robertson named the new hospital the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and revised the budget up to $1.2 billion by way of an official announcement. He also confirmed construction will begin in mid 2010. I table a copy of a release by the minister dated 6 August 2008 in relation to that matter.</Hansard-Body>

Now, of course, we come to the election of March 2009. The government is completely silent on what has happened to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. In fact, we are led to believe that things are going along very nicely, that nothing is going to change, that the deadline, the cost and the bed numbers listed by this government, as I have indicated earlier, would be rolled out. The election comes and there is no announcement about the hospital being deferred. In June 2009 the Deputy Premier and then minister for health, Mr Paul Lucas, flags that the global financial crisis has now led to a delay in the new Sunshine Coast Hospital being built and the budget has been revised to $1.57 billion. In a media release dated 14 June 2009 he also outlines that the completion date will now be 2016, not 2014. I table a copy of the media release in relation thereto.</Hansard-Body>

 I withdraw the comment. This government claims that it has the right to attack the LNP when the history of this hospital from 2005 until the current date has been littered with mistruths, innuendoes, false statements and simply plain untruths right across that timeline. The LNP is going to deliver this hospital to the Sunshine Coast. We will deliver it quicker than this government can. The history of this government on this particular hospital site is an appalling waste of money--in 2005 a cost of $500 million and in 2011-12 a cost of $2.03 billion. There has not been one brick laid on the dirt set aside for this hospital--not one brick in the last six years. It will not be until 2016-17 that that occurs. That is an appalling indictment upon a government. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame that they have the gall and the temerity to attack the LNP. We have consistently made it quite clear that we will build this hospital and we will build it sooner. The member for Morayfield can hold up any funny piece of paper he likes, the facts are that the Labor government has delayed this hospital for the last six years. Premier Peter Beattie started the rot. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let us start with a quick snapshot of the Queensland Children’s Hospital. In or about April 2006, the development of that hospital was announced with a budget of $700 million. It has now reached a budget of $1.4 billion. That is more wasted money. Do members know why? Because, again, this government did not do the planning. It did not do the basic work required to establish that the hospital should move to that site. No health services plan was undertaken. Nothing was done to establish that the size of the site was big enough to cater for the hospital and for the growth required to ensure a centre of excellence for children’s services. </Hansard-Body>

Because the government did not do the planning, it had to use the State Development Act to declare the sites as acquisition sites to compulsorily acquire shops along the Stanley Street frontage to the corner of Vulture Street, a 36 strata title motel in Raymond Terrace and privately owned properties in Graham Street; to negotiate the purchase of the Mater Health Services car park in Raymond Terrace; to negotiate the purchase of the heritage building on the corner of Stanley and Vulture streets; and to acquire an additional building on Stanley Street opposite the Mater Children’s Hospital currently occupied by a multicultural organisation and the Somerville House junior boarding school in Raymond Terrace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054427"></A>
However, one of the pinnacles of this debacle was the need to buy the Telstra site at a cost of $78 million. One of the most telling comments about that appears in today’s Courier-Mail. In relation to buying the site, Telstra spokesperson Tracey Wickham said that it ‘made sense to use this opportunity’. She was so right. Because this government could not acquire the site, it had to negotiate to buy it because it is federally controlled land. Telstra knew that the government did not get the planning right and extracted $78 million from the taxpayers of this state, for the simple reason that a health service plan and site analysis was not undertaken on the site. That is a further waste by this government of money that could have been poured into delivering services right across the state and it is a clear indication that the government should hang its head in shame. In addition, there is no doubt that the site will lack the capacity to provide the research needs for children across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054431"></A>
Another issue that came to light involving health service planning was outpatient waiting lists. Last week a deplorable situation came to light when the Gold Coast Hospital issued 300 letters to people who had been referred as outpatients to the Gold Coast Hospital. The hospital told those patients that they would not be put on the waiting list because it is too long. I am concerned that earlier this week in the House the minister made this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054433"></A>
I made it clear when I first became health minister that tackling outpatient waiting lists was one of my key priorities. This work already underway is proof that we take this issue extremely seriously. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054435"></A>
The outpatient waiting list was identified in 2007 by Professor Ken Donald, chair of the Specialist Outpatient Review Committee, in <Hansard-Italic>
A report on access to specialist outpatient services in Queensland public hospitals</Hansard-Italic>
. On page 1, in the foreword to the report, Professor Donald states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054439"></A>
Specialist outpatient services in Queensland public hospitals require the urgent attention of Government, Queensland Health and hospital managers alike. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1054440"></A>
The last line of the foreword states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054442"></A>
Failure to address these issues will result in further deterioration in the provision of specialist outpatient services in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054443"></A>
I want to know how a health minister who says he is taking care of outpatient waiting lists cannot be informed by his department that a major hospital in this state is breaching policy or making its own policy? When a person is referred by a GP to an outpatient clinic, the hospital has no option: that person must be placed on the list. Who determined this policy? What process was put in train by the Gold Coast Hospital to make it hospital policy? How widespread is the policy? What has the government done to rectify the situation? Is the minister aware of the June 2007 report prepared by his department’s own committee for its implementation? Recommendation 3 of the report makes it very clear what is required to be done. It is one of 11 recommendations. I will not read the recommendation in total, but it touches upon a lot of the issues raised in this House, the public and the media. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054444"></A>
In the few moments I have left, I will touch upon a few issues in relation to Caloundra. The Landsborough Railway Station sits in the state electorate of Caloundra. Every day many people park their vehicles at the station and catch the train to and from Brisbane. The problem is this: so many people are parking in the area around the Landsborough station that they are blocking access by other users to businesses in Landsborough. There is land vacant on the other side of the car park, adjacent to the railway line, that could be used for that purpose. It is a simple and straightforward solution that would alleviate the immediate problem. It would not solve the long-term problem, but it would alleviate the immediate problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054445"></A>
Earlier this week in the House I spoke about issues involving the Caloundra Coast Guard. I will not go over that again, except to say that it is a necessity that the state government and the Sunshine Coast council work together to ensure tenure and security for the people who work as volunteers on a daily basis and also to secure their property, their boats, their equipment and other items they use to save lives. The installation of CCTV is a critical component in providing for the long-term safety and welfare of people in Caloundra, both in Bulcock Street and along Bulcock Beach. Recent incidents have raised issues, particularly the damage done to the Ithaca Royal Lifesaving Club and a number of broken or marked windows in Bulcock Street. Also, there is a need for the CAMCOS rail corridor to be upgraded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054448"></A>
It is important that we as a state undertake a revamp of how we deliver health services across the state. At this time we are simply not delivering the outcomes we need. We have ramping, we have access blocks, we have blowouts in budgets and we have people on waiting lists on waiting lists on waiting lists. My concern is that if there is a third waiting list--that is, the ‘access denied’ waiting list--will there be a list for those who have seen the outpatient GP but have not been placed on the elective surgery waiting list? Is there now a fourth waiting list? Has a hospital taken it upon itself to decide that, even though a patient has been referred to an outpatient waiting list, a patient will not be put on the elective surgery waiting list? That may be argued as nonsense, but a week or two weeks ago no-one on the Labor side of this House would have argued that a hospital would not put a patient on an outpatient specialist waiting list. There is nothing to disprove my argument that people could now be on a fourth waiting list and are simply languishing there because a hospital does not want to burden its waiting list. </Hansard-Body>

In many ways, what those two politicians experienced is exactly what too many Queenslanders are suffering from and, more broadly, what parliament is not delivering for the public at large. This is occurring in tandem with one of the greatest commodity booms in our state’s and nation’s history. I do not wish to demean any of those involved--and there were others, including the member for Maroochydore, who was here earlier--or question the sincerity and the worth of the great cause, but sometimes you cannot really understand a situation until you walk in another man’s shoes. </A></Hansard-Body>

Debt is causing great community pain. Both the Treasurer and shadow Treasurer have made clear statements. The Treasurer will never deliver a surplus budget and the shadow Treasurer will deliver a budget in surplus. That is the stark contrast of the two political positions. The shadow Treasurer predicates his statement by stating that he accepts Treasury forecasts and the Treasurer justifies his position by stating that it is all about recovery and reconstruction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057907"></A>
The Treasurer is young and inexperienced. He has fallen into the trap of believing it is possible to carry such a large debt burden without any real penalty. He also seems to miss the point that Australia is a country of droughts and flooding rains and always will be. We are always having to repair the damage from the weather. </Hansard-Body>

Victoria has half of Queensland’s debt and New South Wales, the former basket case, has two-thirds of our debt. Promises are nothing if they are incapable of being paid for. Labor is no better than a habitual overspender with a credit card problem. Unfortunately, in Australia that alone is a $49 billion problem. Labor will not stop borrowing because it will not stop spending. Critically, this government shows that it does not know how to rein in its own uncontrolled spending, compounding the structural deficit of its balance sheet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057912"></A>
There is no retrieval strategy to break the chronic deficit budgeting of Labor. The evidence for this is that, even after allowing for the $17 billion asset sale, the 2015 debt is projected to be $85 billion, doubling state debt within eight years. The aspirational goal of the AAA credit rating is gone and so is QR National, Abbot Point, Fisherman Islands port, the waterways, the hardwood forests, the airports and surplus land. In summary, the debt is increased to fund recurrent expenditure and declining economic stimulus capital expenditure. The Commonwealth is funding 75 per cent of the disaster funding. So it is immoral to claim the full cost of reconstruction at $6 billion on the budget bottom line. State revenue has continued on a three per cent annual uplift, but expenditure is haemorrhaging at a six per cent increase. By 2014 the interest bill alone will be a $5 billion hit to the budget bottom line, effectively not funding any income-producing assets. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057915"></A>
The Treasurer made the outrageous statement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057917"></A>
This State Budget puts us right back where we belong--out in front.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The minister is out there on his Pat Malone. Almost as a joke, he adds--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057921"></A>
It marches back towards surplus. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057922"></A>
The illusion is that is where it is headed. That is untrue and it is cowardly. If the government expects the public to be conned, I can tell it that they are not. Even if the remaining QR National asset is sold in September next year--and the income will probably be claimed in the next election campaign as the potential fund to pay for some more irrelevant programs--then nothing tangible was gained by selling key assets at a very difficult time in our history. The Treasurer and Labor are pinning all their new hopes on a cash bonanza from CSG/LNG as their economic budgetary and political saviour. They are hopeless dreamers and fools if they believe that will come true. The new Walter Mitty of Queensland politics is probably the Treasurer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057925"></A>
In failing to plan, Labor has consigned Queensland to always be behind. Labor’s plan is one dimensional and ignores the fact that the world stock market is currently in retreat. Greece is certainly in imminent danger of default and possibly so are Spain and Portugal. As was announced yesterday, US company income has slowed significantly. There is every chance that the world’s major economies may step back to zero per cent growth or maybe re-enter recession. We need to plan for that, and that is not done here in the budget. Do not think Western Australia will not compete for gas contracts even though we have what we think are done deals. A done deal is measured by dollars in the bank. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

As the Treasurer talks about ego and careers, I sincerely ask that we focus on facts and detailed analysis. History will judge him very harshly for financial recklessness. The impact of uncontrolled spending by Labor governments globally has had near identical end consequences, those being devastating cuts to services, community pain and anger and far too many people losing their jobs or having to move to find employment. Two days ago Nick Nichols correctly stated in the <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1057929"></A>
This year’s State Budget had an air of urgency, even desperation, about it as Treasurer Andrew Fraser moved to justify Queensland’s mounting debt burden. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057930"></A>
It is no wonder that the Treasurer forgot to even bring his budget speech into the parliamentary chamber on Tuesday. The figures confirm everyone’s worst fears: zero per cent growth in this financial year, a deficit of $2.127 billion and $4 billion in 2012-13, a 20 per cent fall in the capital expenditure to $14.9 billion and borrowing as a proportion of GSP at 20 per cent or greater every year until 2015 peaking at 24.2 per cent in 2013-14. We can ignore this nine per cent figure as it is the proportion of GSP that is the critical figure. Gross debt is to rise from $65 billion this year to $84.9 billion in 2014-15. This is occurring in a wider national environment of rising onshore interest rates, a rising Australian dollar, rising industrial disputation, declining national employment and intolerable cost-of-living increases with another 30 per cent increase in projected electricity increases in the next two years alone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057932"></A>
Nick Nichols again confirms what we all know. He stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057934"></A>
The debt figure would have been much worse without ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1057935"></A>
--the sale of Queensland assets. Those assets will yield $17 billion, which will only offset 3 years of debt repayments. GST income is static at $9.1 billion with total revenue in 2010-11 of $43.007 billion, again with a three per cent annual uplift. That puts paid to all this nonsense about the GFC effect of the past. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057936"></A>
Total dwellings approvals are down 13 per cent in the last year alone with a 15 per cent decline in housing finance approvals in this same year, and they continue to decline. Our economy has stalled. The government has overspent by $5 billion if it is assumed that the Commonwealth will fund 75 per cent of the disaster recovery expenditure--as it will. Therefore, there is a debt growth creep of $6 billion in this budget. Therefore, in gambling terms, this budget is doubled down for the third year in a row as Treasury has spent twice incorrectly before. For those who have an interest in gambling, I point out that the odds of achieving success with a third double down are extremely low. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057937"></A>
This budget hinges on our energy investments quickly reversing our state’s fortunes. Business investment will thereby rise from 9.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent and, inexplicably, dwelling investment has been quoted as doubling from 6.5 per cent to 13 per cent in spite of the Treasurer removing the stamp duty concession, which on the average $400,000 home is $7,500 and, of course, this $10,000 grant being in existence for only six months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057938"></A>
At present in Queensland there are two worlds within one. This is confirmed by observation at the most regional parliamentary sitting in Mackay. This budget is desperately assuming that the business investment will not only happen but that the five per cent growth target in 2012-13 will result from it. Labor neither cares nor understands the personal pain that Queenslanders are suffering as the Labor government hedges, as I say, all its bets on the turn of a roulette wheel for the economic fortunes of the state. Labor is unable to handle and cannot be trusted with money. By aggressively producing budget deficits of unheard sizes in our state’s history within this budget, effectively shutting down economically productive areas such as private property transactions, mining on Stradbroke Island and property development by a failed PIP charging scheme, Labor is continuing its policy of taxing, levying, charging and blundering its way through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057940"></A>
The net result is that of driving down confidence both in the market and the public. The impact has been a massive decline in Labor’s primary vote in Queensland. Public anger is increasing and there is an increasing movement of our working population out of the state. There has also been a severe broad based decline in profitability on anything other than mining or energy related businesses in the state to the point at which all of those businesses are considered to be in recession, as stated by the head of Linfox both in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 last week and the <Hansard-Italic>

 in the middle of last week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057942"></A>
The practical effect of this in my electorate of Gaven is that the public are both suffering real and economic pain. In my electorate 13 per cent are unemployed and 40 per cent are underemployed. They are having trouble feeding themselves and their families. They cannot afford the electricity price increases, the water price increases and the cost of fuel, especially after removing the fuel subsidy. But what did those people get from the last budget? They got a new footy stadium. For the benefit of the member for Southport, it is actually Metricon Stadium, which is the home of the Suns. He actually confused them with the Titans. It is only going to be used eight times a year. Those people cannot even afford a family ticket to enter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057944"></A>
The budget removes their ambulance tax, but increases the stamp duty on moving home by $7,500 on the average home. Go card prices have increased 15 per cent and will rise by the same every year. For those who commute to Brisbane, it makes it all that much harder to actually survive. By a survey, what the $60 million allocated to move the showgrounds from Parkwood to Carrara offers locals other than greater traffic noise, dust and pain escapes 90 per cent of my constituents. The M1 remains a mess from Helensvale to the border because Labor spent all the federally allocated funds at Daisy Hill, and we can see what is going on with regard to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057982"></A>
Do honourable members remember all that talk about Labor’s concern for working families? Working families in Gaven needed lower stamp duty yet received a 125 per cent increase in stamp duty when purchasing an average home. With sales down already 60 per cent, there will be a knock-on effect to conveyancers, building and pest inspectors, property valuers, mortgage brokers, printers, sign-writers, photographers and a lot more. There are staff who work in all of these offices. They are moving to a situation where they have unaffordable mortgages and there are going to be significant repossessions. This is all because we have rushed changes to stamp duty concessions and it was not discussed with these people. That is what is really happening in the housing market. </Hansard-Body>

Many need to understand that there are also problems in the public housing market. There are homes in my electorate that are empty. There is one in Carrara that has not had a tenant in it for weeks, possibly even months. The house is open, the grass is growing and the neighbours realise just how expensive it is. Our area has a waiting list as long as any other in the nation, I would think, yet we cannot get people into these homes. I ask the minister to particularly look at that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057986"></A>
My constituents were looking for more police in places like Nerang and Pacific Pines for obvious reasons. There have been recent tragedies, as we all know. I could list the armed robberies that occur every day. I do not want to, but I can tell members that we have hit 52--52 armed robberies. It is just absolutely outrageous. They missed out on getting even one officer, even though we have lost one officer who put his life on the line in the name of duty. People are nervous. They are suffering pain and they are angry, but they are getting nothing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057988"></A>
My constituents needed more relevant bus timetables. They have bus timetables that are literally circa 1995. Unless the Gold Coast City Council stumps up another $700,000 to be paid to TransLink for a single bus service in Pacific Pines, they are going to lose that service as well. The Transport Workers Union did help us with the campaign and the Labor government even ignored them. They even passed a law that fines drivers for illegally urinating in public. These people cannot even get access to toilets! Crowding on trains travelling to Brisbane in peak hour is Third World. You have to see it to believe it. It is Third World. Nothing is being offered to duplicate the rail lines. The state government advertising budget would pay for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057992"></A>
Despite the M1 carrying 100,000-plus vehicles per day through Nerang, we cannot get the road widened to cope with the massive afternoon gridlock that now starts at two o’clock and finishes near seven o’clock. Residents at Carrara and staff at the Carrara Health Centre have been promised parking, and of course they have not got it. It is a car park that has never eventuated despite multiple questions to the minister and the government saying they are going to build it. Please go ahead and build this. Please allocate the money. The state government refuses to deal with the council over this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057994"></A>
Just to make this a farce, there is a crazy campaign that was run in the last 12 months called TravelSmart. It cost $1.5 million. It was spent on convincing people to get out of their cars and crowd onto the train, hitch a ride with friends or find another job. All sorts of gimmicks were given away to trick people into believing that it is normal to catch a train, particularly a very crowded one, and not get a seat. </Hansard-Body>

I heard that we are alleged to not have supported the Gold Coast University Hospital, as the member for Broadwater stated earlier. We did support it. We are just trying to understand why it does not have the 350 extra beds that it will need by the time it is finished. We also want to know why the old Gold Coast Hospital, which is not that old at all, really, needs to be demolished. </Hansard-Body>

As for the light rail--which I have heard we have been criticised about--it ignores 75 per cent of the Gold Coast population. That is great value for $1 billion--not! The problem with this budget, with a deficit of $2 billion--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058000"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lawlor:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 So your party are against it, are they? They are against the light rail; is that the case? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058001"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, no. Hear me out. The member will get his turn to speak. The problem with this budget, with a deficit of $2 billion and peaking at $4 billion in 2013-14, is that it cannot even be explained in Labor’s philosophical terms. That philosophy is primarily that a budget deficit is essential for stable economic growth if the contribution of net exports--that is, the difference between exports and imports--is not strong enough to sustain domestic demand and the private domestic sector is trying to save. Currently this exists because the federal government is borrowing actively in the markets and competing with business. Interest rates are progressively rising, sucking in overseas capital which is increasing the value of the Australian dollar, and businesses other than commodity trading and energy related businesses are technically in recession. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058002"></A>
The state driving debt accumulation at the same time as the Commonwealth government only further contributes to greater community pain and flattening growth, especially when the capital expenditure is non-income producing and is being progressively withdrawn and when expenditure rises increasingly beyond the growth of revenue. When a state which is part of a federation of states, as we are, runs continuous deficits and builds up a large underlying net debt, this has the impact of reducing confidence and market expectation; capital via private investment will drift to more stable, secure places, as is already occurring; the state loses flexibility in policy options; and there is decreasing ability to repay the debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058003"></A>
The current use of continuing state deficits is a flawed response to our present situation. It is effectively attempting to maintain economic stimulus when capital inflows are at historic highs and unused labour--in other words, the number of people employed--is at historic lows and government expenditure is directed primarily to uncontrolled recurrent expenditure of government itself. A similar situation led to the 1987 stock market crash 24 years ago in the US. It should have taught us something. Our situation now is nearly identical to the situation then. It gets worse because the state and federal Labor governments are out of sync. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058005"></A>
Our federal government continues to shock our state economy with extraordinary decisions such as the recent total suspension of live cattle exports to Indonesia, our major northern cattle market. The state has sold assets and by increasing our debt burden has increased our dependence on foreigners and their ability to control our available capital. The impact will be reduced investment and intrasensitive consumption, decreased savings, the need to negotiate a federal bail-out--did the government hear that; a federal bail-out--a wave of bankruptcies and negativity that cycles back to feed on itself. As I indicated, this could be Queensland’s equivalent of the 1987 crash. The mineral resource rent tax at 22 per cent looks to be a near certainty to constrain the state to properly grow its revenue base via net energy exports, primarily CSG and coal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058006"></A>
There is no way for Queensland to move other than to massively diminish our chronic current and projected budget deficits, to rein in recurrent expenditure yet maintain capital expenditure but target it to infrastructure and income production. Far from now suggesting a balanced budget, which may exacerbate the business cycle--although that is what we have to get to--merely reducing the deficit to 10 per cent of the current situation would reverse most of the problems ahead. With the Commonwealth funding 75 per cent of the disaster recovery, we would possibly be in a much stronger position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058007"></A>
The Labor approach is a 2011 version of ‘voodoo economics’. In this case the addiction to huge deficits is being used to argue the case for labour supply and employment. Honourable members, this theory is utter nonsense, and without the mass movement of population unemployment in Queensland will disproportionally rise. </Hansard-Body>

This budget is a win for transport in Queensland. The state government will invest a massive $1.8 billion in transport infrastructure to deliver better public transport for our future. This budget will support the planning, delivery and management of the state’s transport system by focusing on connecting communities, providing access to services that support commerce and industry. </A></Hansard-Body>

We are supporting a number of key projects: the Gold Coast Rapid Transit system, the Moreton Bay rail link, a number of busway projects and improvements to the cycle network. In the budget for 2011-12 we will invest $175.3 million for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit system to progress the light rail transport option from Southport to Broadbeach. This project will deliver a world-standard light rail system to the Gold Coast and bring the latest in light rail technology to Australia. Construction of the light rail corridor will start this financial year, and the project alone will transform the Gold Coast region into a truly international city. But it does not end there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058017"></A>
The Moreton Bay rail link is quickly becoming a reality. The Bligh government has moved forward funding of $12 million as part of a joint commitment of $47 million between the Australian government, the Moreton Bay Regional Council and the state. We already have geotechnical work happening out there. Moreton Bay is one of the fastest growing regions in the country. The current population of around 375,000 people is expected to increase to more than 500,000 people by 2031. The rail line is expected to be operational in 2016. </Hansard-Body>

We are contributing $93.7 million to complete the construction of the Northern Busway between Enoggera Creek and Kedron. Next year, this will extend the existing busway from the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital to Kedron. This investment will be supported with a $28.5 million injection of funding from this year’s budget to plan the next stage of the Northern Busway between Kedron and Bracken Ridge. </Hansard-Body>

We will continue to improve the busway network to the east with $66.3 million to complete stage 2 of the Eastern Busway between the South East Busway and Main Avenue, Coorparoo. Our busways are world class. People from all over the world come to Queensland to see our state-of-the-art busways. Instead of the shadow minister criticising our public transport network, he should get out and start using some of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061652"></A>
I already commented in the House this week about meeting our election commitment of delivering 1,300 park and rides. Not only will we meet that; we will almost double it. A hallmark of this government has been that we have delivered more frequent and reliable public transport services. This year, TransLink will receive a record $48.2 million for improving public transport infrastructure. This means 125 new and replacement buses for Brisbane and a commitment for more train carriages on the Citytrain network. These new 125 buses are funded 100 per cent by this Bligh government. TransLink’s budget has increased by more than nine per cent on the previous financial year, with an extra $134 million allocated for public transport services. This additional funding will help pay for more public transport services, new and improved stations and more park and rides. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061654"></A>
In 2010-11 the Bligh government delivered an extra 305,000 weekly seats across the TransLink network and we will continue to deliver more this year. I can say that 200,000 of those seats were on buses and trains as part of the largest rail timetable overhaul in 15 years that commenced earlier this month on 6 June. This was particularly for the train line that incorporates Rosewood and Ipswich through to Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast. The timetable changes have been well received. I understand that there are some issues currently around the 5.22 pm service from Central to the Sunshine Coast, and Queensland Rail and TransLink will continue to monitor this service. In fact we had people out there last week and they will continue to be there this week. We are paying very close attention to this issue. I will be meeting with the CEOs of both Queensland Rail and TransLink at the end of the month to see whether we can make any improvements around that particular service. I am sure that members will be pleased that we are keeping an eye on that issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061655"></A>
Once again, all we see is the opposition criticising these timetable changes, criticising Queensland Rail, criticising TransLink. But not all of the members opposite have criticised this change. The member for Gympie stated on 6 June in a tweet, ‘Just back from welcoming the new midday train to Gympie. Passengers are really happy with the new service, better than the old 15 hour round trip.’ It is good to hear some support right across the board.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061656"></A>
We are focused on improving public transport services, public transport infrastructure and customer service. I was very pleased to hold the first meeting of our Public Transport Advisory Group a couple of weeks ago. We now have community champions right across South-East Queensland. One of our first priorities, as I have said in this House, is to look at how we can bring about some go card enhancements. That is something I am committed to and everybody on that committee shared those views. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061658"></A>
The Bligh government has a plan for the future. That is why Queensland Rail will be spending $1.157 billion for infrastructure investment on improving the state’s rail network through major projects, including the Darra to Springfield Transport Corridor project. This project is vital to the south-west corridor and we are catering for the growth in this region. The Darra to Richlands part is now complete, and we are currently commencing geotechnical works from Richlands out to Springfield. This is a fantastic project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061659"></A>
The Richlands Train Station is in my own electorate and I can report that I had a call to my electorate office from a constituent this week. He called to say that there was excellent service by staff at the Richlands station, that he was a first time user and that he could not have been happier with his experience. So we are not only expanding our services; we are also getting new people onto our public transport network. We will spend $118.3 million on this project to complete construction of new dual track from Richlands to Springfield and new stations at Springfield Lakes and Springfield. There is also $27.3 million for new stabling facilities for rolling stock.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061660"></A>
It is worth mentioning at this point the outstanding efforts of Queensland Rail to reopen rail lines following our summer of disaster. Approximately 3,800 kilometres of track was closed due to the effects of flooding and cyclone activity. I acknowledge the tremendous recovery efforts made by Queensland Rail to re-establish these vital links and get Queensland moving again. I want to place on record my thanks to the staff who helped get our state moving again--the hundreds of workers dedicated to getting our passenger and freight lines up and running.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061661"></A>
I have spoken in this House about our efforts in relation to cycling. We are doubling our effort here, from $20.2 million in 2010-11 to $48.3 million this year. Once again, this shows our commitment to providing alternative means of transport, and this is critical. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061662"></A>
We are also continuing our $2.9 million investment in our Regional Airports Development Scheme. I know that members in the Cairns region are happy with the $12 million to work on City Place Bus Station. The member for Keppel is very happy with the $1.1 million for the Yeppoon Rail Trail, a cycling and walking track. This is something that he has been speaking to me and the Treasurer about. He has been very passionate about it and this is very well received in his local community. We will also connect regional and rural Queenslanders through improvements to rail freight lines, such as the $1.5 million upgrades and priority works on the Mount Isa line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061663"></A>
In relation to multicultural affairs, we will continue to contribute to our multicultural communities through this year’s budget. The 2011-12 multicultural services budget is $8.032 million. Yesterday, the member for Indooroopilly stood in here and mislead the House in relation to funding for multicultural affairs by stating that there have been significant cuts in funding from the previous year. In fact, when looking at the hard figures alone, you can see that in 2010-11, we actually funded 29 more events and projects than we did in the previous year. That is an increase in funding of 29.6 per cent. I would personally like to again acknowledge the outstanding fundraising efforts of multicultural groups to the Premier’s flood relief appeal. There have been outstanding contributions from our communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061664"></A>
I want to mention some specifics in my own local electorate. The budget has been very well received. I have spoken about transport and how vital that is. Education is also very important. Over the last couple of years, we have seen $70 million injected into basically renewing our schools under the State Schools of Tomorrow fund. The Minister for Education recently came out to the opening of the new Richlands East State School. It looked brand-new. We are seeing a huge transformation in these children. Their behaviour is fantastic, they are committed to learning, they have got smart boards in the classroom. This is the Bligh government investing in education. This budget also includes a new kindergarten for Durack and new air conditioning at Darra State School. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061667"></A>
In conclusion, I want to mention that $54.9 million is funded to continue developing the Queensland Police Academy at Wacol. All of these good things are happening out at Inala. There is a brand-new police academy. Progress is going well. We had the opening of the driver training centre recently and we also have some work to upgrade Progress Road.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061669"></A>
Housing always continues to be a major issue in my area. It is good to see that we have partnered with the Australian government’s National Rental Affordability Scheme to offer financial incentives to private investors to build more homes to be rented at 20 per cent below the market price. I welcome this substantial development for housing in Inala.
The choices made in this year’s budget will hold us in good stead for our future. I thank the Treasurer for his efforts in delivering a fantastic budget which is going to have a huge impact on our communities. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Our stadiums pump more than $308 million in direct and indirect benefits into the Queensland economy every year.

 These stadiums are economic drivers. It went to Rocky and said, ‘Maybe a private operator could run these ventures.’ We all know that our stadiums are not cash cows; they are about jobs and about creating economic impact. They are about tourism.</Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from a great supporter of the Central Queensland NRL bid. If that bid is successful, we on this side of the House will build a stadium whereas those on the other side of the House have the complete opposite view. It has put on the record that stadiums are a waste of money. Rest assured, everyone in sport will get to know what those opposite are on about. They do not care about sport, they do not care about jobs and they do not care about stadiums. The LNP’s Campbell Newman showed his true colours when he said that he would wait for private enterprise to come forward to run the stadium, even at Rockhampton. Look at his track record with the Clem7 and the CityCycle scheme. Heaven forbid that he tries to privatise the stadiums, as the Rockhampton paper says is his idea!</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1065220"></A>
As I said, this year’s budget also focuses on the importance of local sport and recreation clubs. We are providing a $10 million boost for the popular Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan, enabling grassroots clubs around the state to hire about 150 coordinators to build capacity and recruit participants, partners and volunteers. We are also currently in the process of rolling out the Sport and Recreation Infrastructure Program. The budget allows for $20 million for new spaces and places, new or upgraded player and officials’ amenities, shade structures, new multipurpose facilities and additional work for flood affected facilities. In addition, $6 million is allocated for the Sport and Recreation Active Inclusion Program to increase opportunities for disadvantaged individuals and groups to participate in sport. We are also committing $5 million to continue to support Indigenous initiatives in the area of sport. I wonder if the LNP regards this as a waste of money! Unlike the LNP, the Bligh government is focused on what is best for all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065225"></A>
This year’s budget also provides a record $733 million for Child Safety to keep our children and young people safe. That includes $15 million to continue the Helping Out Families initiative. Already more than 1,040 families have been supported through Helping Out Families. Under the initiative, families are assessed and referred for support in dealing with issues including parenting, alcohol abuse and budgeting. Where is the LNP policy on child safety? There is not one--just a discussion paper two years ago. It is not interested. No-one from its frontbench is here to listen to the budget debate. That just shows what a joke it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065228"></A>
This government is out there making a difference. We will increase recurrent funding for the Evolve program by $2 million so that 40 additional children and young people with complex needs will get support. We are also spending $9.4 million in assisting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. Some 2,600 families in crisis each year will be assisted, and we are continuing our investment in safe houses at Mornington Island, Lockhart River, the Torres Strait, the northern peninsula area and a permanent facility at Napranum. Non-government run small group homes will get a boost, with $10.6 million set aside. There will be new homes at Loganlea, Chandler, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Atherton and Cairns. These budget measures are designed to protect children in care and also help families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065231"></A>
Locally in Mansfield, which I have had the great pleasure of representing for the past 13 years, the government is allocating $1.41 million for stage 2 of the Metro South TAFE and $1.33 million for a kindergarten refurbishment at Mount Gravatt East State School. For our local roads, we are spending $36 million to upgrade two key intersections on Mount Gravatt-Capalaba and Mount Cotton roads. That means jobs, but we are also setting aside $29 million to assist low-skill workers and support the Queensland Green Army strategy. At the grassroots, community level the government is helping blokes who may feel a bit isolated to share their common interests. They will soon be able to hook up at the $200,000 Men’s Shed at the Mount Gravatt showgrounds to help them in not just their DYI projects but also their self-esteem.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065234"></A>
It is great to be part of a government that makes the hard economic decisions but also thinks about families and thinks about the community. I will continue to try to get as much as I can for the great electorate of Mansfield. I look forward to working with all of my cabinet and parliamentary colleagues on this side of the House in supporting this great budget. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_154527" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Townsville--ALP) (3.45 pm): I am pleased to rise to participate in this cognate debate on the Appropriation Bill, the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill and the Community Ambulance Cover Levy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This week’s state budget has delivered on the infrastructure, services and household relief that our state, and in particular the electorate of Townsville, needs. A budget which is delivered in the context of the worst natural disasters on record, this budget will rebuild Queensland, it will boost and support industry that is suffering, and it will provide relief for Queenslanders who are doing it tough. North Queensland has benefited greatly out of this year’s state budget, which has a real focus on the vital role our region will play in the state’s future.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1065246"></A>
Following the Premier’s endorsement of Townsville as the second capital of Queensland last year, this budget makes real progress in ensuring the foundations are laid and the region is ready for what lies ahead. Continuing investment in Townsville’s CBD and the port is solid proof of this government’s commitment to Townsville and the region. Townsville’s inner city is undergoing a major rejuvenation, and I absolutely welcome the state government announcing plans to commission the construction and be the anchor tenant of a new city building. I have been leading the charge for the state government to make this strategic decision for some time. This announcement will be a catalyst for the next stage in the rejuvenation of our CBD in terms of triggering the construction of a major new office building which will be a showcase for new environmental standards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065247"></A>
It makes sense to me to bring together the accommodation needs of our state public servants with the prospect of creating a purpose-built facility that will help build greater confidence in our CBD. Premier Anna Bligh said that the government would seek expressions of interest from CBD property holders next month for up to 10,000 square metres of office accommodation. As anchor tenant, the state government will help breathe new life into the Townsville CBD and help create more opportunities for growth in local businesses. This is solid proof that we recognise Townsville’s important role as Queensland’s second capital and a major driver of the state’s future growth and prosperity. In fact, there are some sites that already hold the development approvals that would allow such office accommodation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065249"></A>
This announcement has received universal support from all stakeholders involved in the CBD revitalisation push. Unfortunately, the tories have started a smear campaign on this important announcement. For people to say that this project is merely political and achieves nothing is a slap in the face for everyone who has been working towards returning our CBD to its former glory. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065250"></A>
More than $23 million will also be spent in this year’s budget completing the Townsville Marine Precinct at the port of Townsville, with an additional $22.8 million being invested to continue the extension of the current berth 10 facility which will see our ocean terminal finally become a reality. Not only will the revamped berth 10 accommodate defence and cruise vessels; it will also have general cargo capability, and it is these investments that our port needs to see us into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065251"></A>
The budget supports an expanding Townsville population and will see council receive over $23 million towards the upgrades of the five wastewater treatment plants at Mount St John, Condon, Deeragun, Bohle and Mount Low. This budget focuses heavily on the government’s priorities. The Treasurer was right in his summation of the budget when he said that, as well as easing cost-of-living pressures on Queensland families, this budget puts first and foremost our plans to rebuild Queensland after the natural disasters. This focus on recovery has also been reflected in the roads funding for our region. The natural disasters we saw earlier this year had a huge impact on our North Queensland roads and we are providing $54.4 million for the reconstruction work to go into the region’s network.</Hansard-Body>

Townsville is a city growing at a cracking pace. We pride ourselves on the quality of lifestyle we offer and part of that appeal is a functional and accessible road network. We see massive investments in our roads in this budget:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069037"></A>
$47.9 million to complete the important duplication of the Douglas Arterial Road.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069038"></A>
We see money to start works on relieving the congestion of the Dalrymple Road-Banfield Drive roundabout. This is one of the most congested roundabouts in the city. The realignment of traffic lands at this site will see vast improvements to traffic flow for residents of Mt Louisa, Heatley and Thuringowa but will also see improved safety for the many students who use this corridor to get to Heatley State High School adjacent to this site.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069039"></A>
Again, more money for the desperately needed additional lanes at the Nathan Street and Dalrymple Road. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069040"></A>
We’re also allocating $1.05 million for resurfacing at O’Keefe Court in Mount Louisa and the Glenwood Drive roundabout, both perfect examples of pertinent local road blemishes we’re committed to addressing in this budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069041"></A>
Students at one of my local primary schools are set to benefit out of this year’s Budget, following the announcement of a major funding boost for better facilities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069042"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Townsville Central State School will receive $45,000 for air-conditioning and an additional $20,000 for a classroom furniture pack. Having worked closely with Principal Sandra Perrett and the rest of her school community to secure these much needed upgrades, I’m incredibly pleased to see the announcements out of this year’s budget. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069043"></A>
The state government is committed to giving our children a flying start in life, and making sure they’re studying and learning in quality classrooms is part of that. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069044"></A>
Mr Speaker, I am continually working with school communities in my electorate to ensure our students have everything they need to reach their full potential and it’s great to see the Budget deliver once again on something I’m extremely passionate about. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069045"></A>
I place on the record my support for the recent government announcement to move year 7 into high schools. I have spoken to parent groups from state, independent and catholic schools in my electorate and I think I can safely say that parents were concerned more about the delay in the decision out of the green paper. They wanted certainty over when changes would be implemented so that their school communities could prepare for the changes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069046"></A>
As a parent of a child who will be in the first cohort affected by the move, I have considered this matter in detail. I want my children learning in a school setting that will stimulate their minds and ensure that they are inspired to become the best people they can be. I firmly believe that the move of Year 7 to high school will give my and all Queensland kids exactly those opportunities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069047"></A>
It is great to see $328 million over four years for the capital works required to get our schools ready for this important change. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069048"></A>
That said, I also understand the concerns that this education reform raises for some. I particularly want to place on the record my continued support and advocacy for a number of smaller primary schools in my electorate who are concerned about the resourcing impacts that this reform may mean for them. I will continue to walk this journey with you and will fight hard to ensure that the message is understood that bigger is not always best. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Magnetic Island C&amp;K offers the only limited hours child care service on the island. Their future has been in the balance following last year’s federal government decision to cease important funding for these services. I cannot stress strongly enough how important this service is for the many families of young children on Magnetic Island. I congratulate the education minister for covering the 50% shortfall in federal funding for the next twelve months. That’s a total of $64 852 for the Magnetic Island C&amp;K in this budget. I thank the education minister for covering this gap and for his continued advocacy with the federal government to get this resolved. I reiterate that I will continue to fight for the ongoing support from both levels of government to ensure the continued operation of this wonderful place of fun and learning and the unique opportunities Magnetic Island children get from being educated within the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069050"></A>
Mr Speaker, this budget provides funds for important community assets on Palm Island as well.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069051"></A>
$1.9million for a new pre-prep facility at Bwgcolman Community School, $150 000 towards revenue replacement following the surrender of general liquor licence, $2.9 million in Financial Aid for Indigenous Councils in lieu of rates to meet the costs of essential services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069052"></A>
Mr Speaker, when we speak about closing the gap of disadvantage between indigenous and non-indigenous Queenslanders I think about economic participation--that is having a job. I am very pleased to see $160 000 in the budget for the advancement of economic development opportunities on Palm Island. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069053"></A>
There is also a $4.62 million for the upgrade and construction of housing on Palm Island. This is on top of $10 million budgeted for the island in last year’s budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069054"></A>
Mr Speaker, targeted stimulus and supports for our residential construction and tourism industries are both strategic and vitally needed. I understand the housing market well. My father is a well known and respected builder in Townsville and I know how tough this industry has been doing it. The $10 000 grant on offer to all brand-new home dwelling purchases will stimulate this industry and get our tradies back on the tools.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069055"></A>
I mentioned the important tourism industry earlier. A massive investment of $83 million will see Queensland attract more major events and drive visitor numbers up. I am passionate about showcasing North Queensland and working with industry to further develop our role in this space.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069056"></A>
I also support the transfer duty reform which will allow for the abolition of the Community Ambulance Levy to save $113 a year off the 1.4 million electricity accounts issued in Queensland. This is important relief for households who I understand are needing relief. Pensioners will also see their electricity rebate increased by 6.6% to $230 and will see a further $20 increase in maximum council rate rebates to $200.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069057"></A>
Of course, the Bligh government rightly said that 2011 will be a year of rebuilding and we can see hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into North Queensland for the rebuilding of our region. $2.2 million to restore our beautiful Strand and other important infrastructure in Townsville. Very importantly, we also see investments to assist our people and community sport and recreation clubs in their recovery from Severe Cyclone Yasi.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069058"></A>
Mr Speaker, I have spoken many times in this place and in my electorate about the expectation I have to have effective and targeted services for homeless people in my region. Services must be targeted to doing whatever it takes to assist people break the cycle of homelessness. Investments in properly supported and targeted housing services in this budget mean that we will no longer be setting people up for failure. We will no longer say to someone who has been sleeping rough for years, who has complicated medical conditions, who in many cases have alcohol or other drug addictions, we will no longer plonk these people in houses or units and wave good-bye. We will properly support them with intense around the clock services to give them every possible chance to improve their quality of life and contribution to our community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069059"></A>
Mr Speaker, I support the bills and commend them to the House. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.49 pm): The budget that was delivered this week was delivered under a heavy dark cloud of the biggest debt that any state government has in Australia. It is the elephant in the room, yet the Treasurer did not mention it throughout his speech. He dodged and sidestepped it. It would have done Graeme Langlands proud to see the step that he did around that amount of debt. Everything that happens in this state is clouded by this debt. This debt pervades every decision made by the government and average people in Queensland are drowning in a massive cost of living. It is making life for them either extremely hard or almost intolerable. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_06_17_DAILY-64.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069067"></A>
Just a few years ago--before the last election and even before the global financial crisis--this government was facing a debt of around $65 billion. Since then, we have seen this debt escalate to the prediction now that in three years time this debt will hit $85 billion. The tragedy of this debt is that in the meantime the government has sold off $17 billion of prime income-earning assets that were earning more in income than the interest they will save by being sold. How smart is that? So despite selling off $17 billion of our best income-earning assets, we are still facing a debt of $85 billion. In other words, without those asset sales this debt could have reached the astronomical level of $102 billion. That is how badly and how quickly this government has driven us into this massive debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069068"></A>
People talk about New South Wales being a financial basket case. But New South Wales has less debt than Queensland and New South Wales has far more people to pay off its debt, because the government debt is the people’s debt. It is the people who pay it off and the people of Queensland are paying that debt off through higher electricity prices and through the 10c a litre increase in petrol--the petrol tax made up of the 8.35c petrol tax plus the GST. So the cost of petrol is going up by anywhere between 9.2c and 10c a litre. We have gas going up, we have water going up, we have rates going up. We have driver’s licences going up and we have car registration going up. Just about every one of the major basic costs of living has gone through the roof because of this government debt and because of the amount of interest that has to be found for both the government debt and the government owned corporations debt. So the people are paying and the people will continue to pay for a long time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069069"></A>
Throughout the Treasurer’s speech this elephant in the room was avoided. There was no plan. What is the plan to meet the interest payments? What is the plan to meet the capital payments? Or is this massive debt just going to be left for generations to come so that our young people who are at high school or in primary school now will be saddled with it? So people will be saddled with this debt for decade after decade after decade. What is the government’s plan? Does it just plan to let the debt lie there and grow and grow--or does the government intend to do something about it? What is the government’s plan to try to get back Queensland’s AAA credit rating, which is probably costing the state in the order of $200 million to $300 million a year simply because the state has to pay an extra penalty on the interest, which none of the other states pay, because of the parlous state of the government’s finances? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069070"></A>
So there we have it. One of the very basics of running the finances of a company, a business, a household or a government has been so badly managed to have such a massive debt. People who have this sort of debt cannot sleep at night, because people who have this sort of debt worry at night about how they are going to pay it off, how they are going to meet the interest and how they are going to meet the capital or they are going to have this debt on their shoulders or hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives with no chance of getting rid of it. But this government does not seem to care. It just seems to let the debt level grow and grow. It has no plan for paying it off. So future generations are going to be saddled with debt as well. Not only us but all the generations to come in Queensland are going to be saddled with this plan. With inflated electricity prices, petrol prices, licence fees, registration fees, gas, rates and everything else that emanates from the cost of paying this debt, people will be saddled with that debt forever as well as this generation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069071"></A>
People are reeling under the cost of living. Even though in this budget there are modest increases in the rebate to pensioners--and to pensioners only--of rates and in some cases water and electricity charges, those pensioners will still be paying for this massive cost of living, because this increase in cost flows through to every business. Everyone who runs a delivery van, everyone who turns on a switch at their business to turn on the lights, everyone who uses water and who pays rates will pay. The debt has to flow on. So the cost of everything is rising. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069072"></A>
On top of that, many small businesses are struggling under the burden of the cost of living. The average working family in Queensland has $100 or more less in their pockets because of the rises that have happened--the 54 per cent rise over the past three years in the cost of electricity, the rise in water charges, the rise in rates, the rise in petrol and everything else. Everyone has a lot less in their pockets. So they are not going into small businesses and buying things. They are putting off making purchases because they have to pay the electricity bill to keep the lights on, they have to keep the taps running with water, they have to pay their rates, they have to put fuel in the car and they have to have a driver’s licence. They are essentials. So those payments come first and down the chain--all the way down the chain--less and less is spent in small businesses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069073"></A>
No wonder there is such uncertainty and lack of confidence. Members should ask anybody who is involved in real estate how things are going. They say that they do not think they have ever seen the market as tight and as tough as it is at the moment. People are tightening their belts. They simply have to, because this massive debt from this state government is coming down on everybody and is causing this huge cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069074"></A>
The budget that was delivered this week made only modest changes to the cost of living. The ambulance levy has been taken off electricity bills. Finally, the government has got rid of that insidious ambulance levy, which should never have been brought in by the Labor Party in the first place and which we voted against and railed against. But its removal makes only a modest change to the actual cost of living for people. All the working families do not get any rebate on electricity, on water, or on their rates. So the cost of living for working families will remain as big a problem as it is at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069075"></A>
The people of Queensland are now waking up to this Labor government. The people of Queensland are realising that government debt is the people’s debt. They understand that much of this debt has been waste, has been bad planning and has been overruns in projects because they were not properly managed and they were not properly overseen. The government has been living beyond its means--paying wage rises that it cannot really afford but just paying wage rises virtually on the basis of debt. We saw a $2 billion deficit in the budget last year and another $4 billion projected in this year’s budget. It goes on and on. The government has no obvious plan of repayment of that money. Obviously, Queenslanders will lose patience with this Labor government and decide, ‘They’ve got no plan, they have no future, and it’s time to look at the LNP.’ I have no doubt that the people of Queensland will say that they have had enough of this government. They cannot take this burden of cost of living--this burden that has been brought on by incompetence and mismanagement, lack of planning and lack of oversight. They will be looking to the LNP to rescue them from this situation. The LNP will have a long-term and sensible plan to bring about the proper financial management of the state so that people and the working families of Queensland are not burdened by this massive cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072774"></A>
One of the real tragedies of this budget--and it is just the most amazing decision by the government--has been to jack up the cost of stamp duty on the purchase of a house by 125 per cent. If anything is designed to destimulate our economy it is this ridiculous decision. About 60 per cent of the business of the average real estate office in Toowoomba comes from people upgrading their home to a better home, people who have been transferred into or out of the town or people moving to another part of the town that might be more convenient to their work or their children’s school. So about 60 per cent of sales are people buying and selling in that area. About 30 per cent of the sales are investment sales and about 10 per cent is new housing. This 125 per cent will be absolute lead in the saddle bags of the real estate industry and will make many people reconsider whether they purchase a house knowing that they will have to pay this extra amount of money. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072777"></A>
On a $400,000 home, instead of paying around $5,500 in stamp duty people will be paying well in excess of $11,000. That is the straw that will break the camel’s back and will cause enormous damage in the real estate industry. This will affect all of the people who work in the industry--not only those in real estate offices but also those involved in conveyancing and other aspects of the industry. This will be a real drag on that very important industry, not only in Toowoomba but all over the state. This decision demonstrates quite clearly what happens when a government is drowning in debt and has to make bad decisions because there is nowhere to go. They have this interest to pay which in three years time will be $5.1 billion--$595,000 on the hour every hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. </Hansard-Body>

The ambulance levy that is to be removed should never have been there in the first place. It was one of the worst decisions ever made by this government. Now it has had to realise how invidious it was. After we have opposed it for so long, the government is finally getting rid of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072779"></A>
I want to talk about a couple of other aspects that will have a great effect upon people in my area as well as throughout the rest of Queensland. The first is this Labor government’s support of the carbon tax. Sensible people know that once the carbon tax is introduced it will put up the cost of just about everything. They know that because they are sensible, normal, average people. They know that the carbon tax will flow through to just about everything that they will buy but particularly to important items such as power, fuel and other essentials. They also know that once the carbon tax is introduced by the Labor government, rebates will go to only certain people. They know that the rebates will not offset the cost that comes directly and indirectly from the carbon tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072780"></A>
The rebate system will probably end up as convoluted as the tax system because as years go by the government will start to put rebates into marginal seats or Labor seats. With all the rest of the stuff that happens, with some of the political manoeuvring that goes on at the federal level, they know that that will happen. They know that they will never get back the extra costs that they have to fork out, whether they are pensioners on rebates or working families getting nothing. They know what will happen because they are just normal, average, thinking, working-class people. That is why there is such antagonism towards it. They know that at the end of the day, when we all wake up in 20, 30, 40 or 50 years time, there will be no difference to the temperature, but there will still be this system that has made it harder and harder for people to live and raise their children because they have to pay this theoretical, hypothetical tax which has nothing to do with getting a true end result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072781"></A>
The other issue I raise in terms of the budget is the live cattle trade because of its importance to our state economy. The Premier and primary industries minister of Queensland have gone missing in action. This is one of the most important industries in the north of the state. This is an industry that has developed feedlots and abattoirs in Indonesia that are as good as or better than similar facilities in Australia where the cattle are washed down every day and under shade. These are first-class facilities developed by companies such as Elders and others that are operating to a high standard. For the federal government to stop all of them and everything else that is associated with them in a blanket ban, instead of maintaining the trade to those places that can meet this proper and high standard that they have achieved and been able to develop in a nation that did not have those sorts of facilities or those sorts of processes, is clearly wrong and has sold out the people of Australia, but particularly Northern and Western Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072782"></A>
Just think of all the people in the trucking industry who will lose their jobs. My colleague the member for Gregory told me the other evening of someone who is thinking of deregistering about 20 road trains. What happens to those drivers and their families? What happens to the people who work in the livestock-handling business in Townsville, Karumba, Cloncurry and those places? What will happen to all these cattle that are there ready to be mustered in this the winter season when they can be mustered? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072783"></A>
By the time this blanket ban of six months is finished we will be back into the wet season and no-one will be able to move. What will happen to the young men and women who fly the helicopter for helimustering and the ringers and other people who get so much employment out of this business? It is an absolute tragedy and shows the mismanagement existing within the Labor ranks, particularly federally but also here. No-one from this state government has stood up on behalf of Queensland. One of our most important industries will be brought to its knees and the flow-through from this decision will come down through Roma to the Darling Downs, to people who are producing cattle in these areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072784"></A>
On average, 500,000 cattle from Queensland go to this live trade every year through the various ports of Queensland and the Northern Territory. My understanding is that at least 350,000 of these cattle have been going to these feedlots and abattoirs that maintain the highest of standards, yet they are all being affected by this blanket ban. We are seeing no fight from the Queensland government. It acquiesces and does not stand up and fight, scratch and claw for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072785"></A>
I want to use a short amount of time allotted for my speech on the budget to praise a wonderful high school in my electorate that has achieved amongst the highest OP results. The Centenary Heights State High School achieved over the 90 per cent mark in the recent report that came out and was in the top 3 high schools in the state for numbers of OPs, particularly OP5 and above. This school has not only achieved that; it has also achieved one of the very best levels of school based apprenticeships and has a special ceremony at the end of every year to recognise the status and importance of school based apprenticeships. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072787"></A>
There is more to it than that. This school also operates, on behalf of our community and particularly on behalf of the Rotary Club of Toowoomba East, the Toowoomba Flexi School for some 50 students who are unable to attend their own school for whatever reason. This can be for family, disciplinary or poverty reasons. There are all sorts of reasons they are unable to attend their own school. The Centenary Heights State High School also looks after the Flexi School in the middle of the CBD. In a wonderful honour to the late John Armstrong, whose family have run the Nissan dealership in Toowoomba for many years, the Flexi School has now been called the John Armstrong Flexi School. John, along with his colleagues from the Rotary Club of Toowoomba East, provided the building and much assistance to make this Flexi School a reality. I say to Centenary Heights State High School, well done! You are a shining light amongst schools in Queensland, be they public or private. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072790"></A>
The achievement of that school, the enthusiasm that has developed in the children, the enthusiasm of the teachers--from the principal, through the deputy principals--right down to the ground staff has to be seen to be believed. Those kids leave the school gate at the end of year 12 as optimistic, confident and self-disciplined young Australians. Well done to them. </Hansard-Body>

My final comment is a warning regarding the Baillie Henderson Hospital. The rumour is that once again they are looking to cut back the bed numbers, putting unfortunate patients out. That has to be stopped. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072849"></A>
I am pleased to introduce the Parliamentary Service and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2011. The bill has two major purposes. The first purpose follows on from the recently passed Parliament of Queensland (Reform and Modernisation) Amendment Act, with the bill seeking to implement further reform to our parliament by altering the way that the Parliamentary Service is administered. Secondly, the bill proposes amendments to the Auditor-General Act 2009 to implement the government’s responses to Public Accounts and Public Works Committee Report Nos. 5 and 7, which address matters raised in the Strategic Review of the Queensland Audit Office. The government’s responses to the reports were tabled on 1 December 2010 and 9 June 2011 respectively.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072850"></A>
From the outset, I would like to make it very clear that the amendments being proposed to the Parliamentary Service Act 1988 in this bill should not in any way be seen as casting aspersions on the way that the Speaker or any of the Speaker’s predecessors have discharged the Speaker’s role for the Parliamentary Service. Indeed, I believe that during my time in this House, the parliament has been served by a succession of Speakers who have upheld the role of the Speaker and have keenly advocated for improved funding for the parliament to enable the provision of enhanced facilities and support services so that members can best serve Queenslanders. These amendments are simply a different way for the Parliamentary Service to be administered, and arise from the bipartisan recommendations that have been made to the parliament and the government by the Committee System Review Committee and the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, CLA.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072851"></A>
In the government’s response to the Committee System Review Committee’s report, we supported the establishment of a bipartisan CLA to, among other things, oversee the parliament’s budget, facilities management for parliamentary committees, maintenance for the parliamentary buildings and policies for the management of the parliament. In this respect, the government also referred the task of reviewing the Parliamentary Service Act 1988 to the CLA. Since March 2011, the CLA has been considering the act and it recommended to the government that the administrative functions of the Speaker with respect to the Parliamentary Service be transferred to either the CLA or the Clerk of the Parliament, as the chief executive of the Parliamentary Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072852"></A>
Under the proposed changes in the bill, the CLA will be responsible for: deciding policies about accommodation and services in the parliamentary precinct and elsewhere such as electorate offices, deciding major policies to guide the operation and management of the Parliamentary Service and preparing budgets and associated submissions to the government, and hearing appeals against promotional appointments and disciplinary actions that might be imposed by the Clerk upon officers or employees of the Parliamentary Service. These matters will be placed in the hands of the six member CLA, made up of three government and three non-government members, and will enable a greater number of members, including non-government members, a direct say in the management of the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072853"></A>
I acknowledge that appeals about promotional appointments and disciplinary actions, particularly in relation to electorate staff, can be very sensitive given the direct working relationship between the electorate officer and member of parliament. Therefore, the government has given and will continue to give careful consideration to how those appeals should be heard. For this reason, the government reserves the right for further review of this amendment during the consideration in detail stage of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072854"></A>
The CLA will be required to work in a bipartisan way, as the chair of the CLA has not been provided with a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes at a meeting. This provision was provided at the request of the CLA and was included in the Parliament of Queensland (Reform and Modernisation) Amendment Act 2011. While I understand that the CLA has already been conducting itself in a bipartisan way while exercising its other parliamentary functions, it is clear that neither the executive nor the opposition acting on their own would be able to control the CLA with respect to its intended role regarding the Parliamentary Service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072855"></A>
The CLA has also recommended to the government that the Speaker’s current role under the act as the employing authority for Parliamentary Service officers and employees be transferred to the Clerk of the Parliament, rather than the CLA. The government supports this recommendation and the bill makes provision accordingly. This reflects arrangements in government departments where directors-general, not ministers, are the employing authority for departmental officers and employees. This change will mean that the Clerk will also appoint electorate office staff. However, such appointments will be made by the Clerk on the recommendation of a member in the same way that a member currently would make such a recommendation to the Speaker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072856"></A>
The bill also provides that the Clerk must ensure that the remuneration, conditions of employment and other benefits given to Parliamentary Service officers and employees are comparable to those of state officers and employees who have similar duties. The equivalent obligation applies to the CLA with respect to the position of Clerk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072857"></A>
The bill provides that following the dissolution of a Legislative Assembly, the CLA continues in existence until the end of the day before the polling day and that from polling day until the appointment of new CLA members are advised to the House, the Clerk will perform the functions of the CLA. However, while the Clerk constitutes the CLA, the Clerk will be required to perform this function under the policies as decided by the CLA before the polling day. This is similar to the provision which applied during election periods, when the Parliamentary Service Commission was responsible for the management of the parliament from 1988 to 1995. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072858"></A>
While the bill provides that the Speaker will not be involved with the management of the Parliamentary Service, the bill inserts certain provisions to maintain the prestige and dignity of the office of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. For instance, the bill provides that the functions of the CLA and the Clerk under the Parliamentary Service Act do not limit the Speaker’s functions under section 50 of the act relating to behaviour in the parliamentary precinct or the Speaker’s functions under the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 or the Standing Rules and Orders of the Legislative Assembly. An express provision is also being inserted to provide that nothing in the act derogates from any power, right or immunity traditionally held or exercised by the Speaker on behalf of the Legislative Assembly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072859"></A>
Furthermore, the bill provides that: the CLA must ensure the Speaker is given the necessary administrative and other support to perform the Speaker’s functions efficiently and effectively; the Speaker may appoint appropriately qualified and competent persons to the Office of Speaker; the CLA must consult with the Speaker before deciding a matter relating to the Speaker or the Legislative Assembly chamber; the Speaker will continue to be consulted by the government, together with the CLA, with respect to the appointment of the Clerk; and the Clerk and Parliamentary Service officers and employees must follow the reasonable directions of the Speaker relating to operations of the Legislative Assembly and the Speaker’s functions relating to the Legislative Assembly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072860"></A>
I now turn to the provisions of the bill relating to the Auditor-General Act 2009. The bill includes amendments to the Auditor-General Act that implement the government’s support for recommendations made by the Public Accounts and Public Works Committee in Report Nos. 5 and 7. As recommended by the committee, the bill provides for a fixed, non-renewable term of appointment for the Auditor-General of seven years. This will further strengthen the independence and integrity of the position of Auditor-General.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072861"></A>
The bill also expands the audit mandate of the Auditor-General through providing for two new types of audits. Firstly, the bill provides the power to conduct an audit of a matter relating to public money and property. This will allow the Auditor-General to examine financial transactions between government entities and third parties, such as companies and community organisations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072862"></A>
In light of the time, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my second reading speech.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072863"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072864"></A>
In conducting this type of audit, the Auditor-General will be able to ‘follow-the-money trail’, including deciding whether Government money or property has been applied economically, efficiently and effectively for the purposes for which it was given. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072865"></A>
As recommended by the Public Accounts and Public Works Committee, the Bill also provides that the Auditor-General must set out the reasons for conducting a ‘follow-the-money trail’ audit. The Auditor-General is to include these reasons and the results of the audit in a report to Parliament.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072866"></A>
The second new type of audit is the power to conduct a full performance audit of a public sector entity. The committee considered that the Auditor-General has extensively tested the boundaries of the existing mandate in relation to performance management systems audits and believed that more could be achieved if that mandate was expanded. The committee acknowledged that although it is management’s responsibility to review and report on their agencies performance this does not prevent the Queensland Audit Office from bringing a fresh and independent assessment of that performance. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072867"></A>
This means that the Auditor-General will be able to examine and report on whether the objects of a Government department or other government entity are being achieved economically, efficiently and effectively. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072868"></A>
As recommended by the committee, the power to conduct a full performance of a GOC or a controlled entity of a GOC, will be at the request of Parliament, a parliamentary committee, the Treasurer or the relevant Minister. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072869"></A>
The committee also recommended that the Auditor-General prepare a strategic audit plan setting out the performance audits and performance management systems audits proposed to be conducted over the following three years. The Bill provides that when preparing the plan, the Auditor-General must consult with the parliamentary committee and any relevant entity, such as a department proposed to be the subject of a performance audit. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072870"></A>
Once a draft of the plan is prepared, the Auditor-General must give the draft to the parliamentary committee for comment and consider these comments when finalising the plan. The plan is then published on the Queensland Audit Office’s website.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072871"></A>
The Bill also implements the committee recommendation to allow the Auditor-General to exempt certain entities that are considered ‘low cost/low risk’ audits from audit by the Queensland Audit Office for up to three financial years. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072872"></A>
An exempted entity must still engage an auditor and provide the Auditor-General with any audit documents on request. The Auditor-General continues to maintain an oversight role in relation to the exempted entity and, if necessary, may revoke the exemption.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072873"></A>
In consulting on the Bill, including with the Auditor-General and the Queensland Audit Office, it was decided to include additional amendments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072874"></A>
The Bill provides that the Auditor-General may conduct an audit jointly, or in collaboration, with the auditor-general of another Australian jurisdiction. This power could be used, for example, in the audit of a Queensland statutory body that received funding from the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments. To facilitate this collaboration, the Bill also provides that the Auditor-General may disclose information obtained in the course of this type of audit to a Commonwealth, State or Territory auditor-general.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072875"></A>
The Bill also amends the definition of ‘protected information’ to include observations, comments, suggestions or notations made by auditors in the conduct of an audit. This is to ensure that an auditor may provide full and frank advice in the conduct of an audit.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072876"></A>
The Bill also makes amendments in relation to where the Auditor-General provides advice to the Treasurer, the relevant Minister or another person about a matter of significance proposed to be included in a report to Parliament. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072877"></A>
The Bill provides that the Auditor-General must also provide a copy of this advice to the Premier. This will ensure that the Premier is kept informed of cross-agency and whole of government issues as they arise. I commend the Bill to the House. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_161942" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (4.19 pm): The Bligh government’s budget increases the state’s debt, delivers another budget deficit, increases the cost of living for families and increases the cost of doing business in Queensland. Despite the government’s claim that revenues from the fire sale of state assets including our railways, forests, ports and motorways would be used to reduce Queensland’s debt, the projected debt remains the same as it was before the fire sale. </A></Hansard-Body>

Premier Bligh and Treasurer Fraser want people to believe that all the state’s financial problems are due to the natural disasters that occurred in Queensland earlier this year. In fact, the state’s debt was already $65 billion before the floods and Cyclone Yasi. With the assets gone, the government’s debt is still projected to reach $85 billion. Without the fire sale, the debt would have blown out to a whopping $100 billion. This debt is massive and unprecedented. At some point it has to be paid back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077327"></A>
The Bligh government’s claim that the abolition of the ambulance levy will reduce electricity bills is hypocritical given that it was the Beattie government that introduced the ambulance levy in the first place. Next year average electricity bills are set to go up by $118, or 6.6 per cent. So the removal of the ambulance levy will be a very temporary benefit. The opposition strongly opposed the ambulance levy when it was introduced and we have now been vindicated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077328"></A>
Motor vehicle registration will increase by three per cent next year on top of a 24 per cent increase over the last three years. This comes on top of recent increases in driver’s licence fees and the removal of the fuel tax rebate in 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077329"></A>
One of the most appalling aspects of the Bligh government’s budget is its decision to slug homebuyers with an extra $7,000 of transfer duty, which will undermine an already fragile housing market in some areas of the state. The fact is that the figures, commitments and initiatives in this budget cannot be relied upon because they do not take into account the impact of the Gillard Labor government’s carbon tax on Queensland’s economy, which the Bligh Labor government supports. Queenslanders should be aware that a Newman LNP government will stand up for them and will strongly oppose Labor’s carbon tax and the cost-of-living pressures it will place on families and businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077330"></A>
The budget allocations in my electorate of Hinchinbrook are unremarkable insofar as they are a mixture of commitments that have been announced previously, have been funded by the federal government, are part of natural disasters claims or are a result of the damage caused by Cyclone Yasi. There are certainly no initiatives in the budget that represent a positive decision by the Bligh government to support industries, businesses and households in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077332"></A>
In the area of main roads, no new projects were announced on the state controlled road network in the Hinchinbrook electorate. I acknowledge the second instalment of $25 million in the 2011-12 financial year for a total project cost of $115 million of federal funding for the previously announced upgrade of the northern section of the Cardwell Range on the Bruce Highway. The only new moneys in my electorate will be the $4.5 million to be spent over two years on Mount Low Parkway which, although a welcome allocation, is a council road funded through the Transport Infrastructure Development Scheme. I am disappointed not to see funds in the budget for state controlled roads that have been a priority for me, such as the Canecutter Way--the road between Innisfail and Silkwood via South Johnstone, Mena Creek and Japoonvale--or the Tully-Mission Beach Road, which needs to be resealed completely after being extensively damaged following Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077343"></A>
Another part of the Bruce Highway that I feel strongly about is the section between Black River and Bluewater north of Townsville. Planning for this section to be widened to four lanes needs to be a priority as the northern beaches area continues to grow. There is a lack of observable progress in the planning for this project. The other day I came across yet another accident just north of Black River. Continued and strong residential growth and traffic associated with the Yabulu nickel refinery on the northern beaches mean that this section warrants more attention from Main Roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077347"></A>
In relation to transport, I am concerned about the failure of a funding allocation in last year’s budget for a new commercial fishing facility at Mourilyan Harbour to be brought forward into the current budget, given the facility has not been delivered. In last year’s budget there was $226,000 through the Far North Queensland Ports Corporation for a new commercial fishing facility at Mourilyan Harbour. It has not been delivered, but the allocation has disappeared from this year’s budget papers. This needs to be explained immediately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077351"></A>
In the area of infrastructure, the announcements in the budget are a mix of ongoing project spending and new initiatives associated with the recovery of the Cassowary Coast region following Cyclone Yasi. The budget contains a $15 million support package for the Cassowary Coast Regional Council to restore council infrastructure, natural vegetation and beach foreshores that were damaged by Cyclone Yasi in February. This allocation is welcome and was jointly funded by the state and federal governments through the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. This funding will be used by the Cassowary Coast Regional Council to undertake repair work not covered by its NDRRA claim. I hope this funding will go some way to meeting the cost of the repair works undertaken by council following Cyclone Yasi that are not covered by its NDRRA claim. The ratepayers of the Cassowary Coast region desperately need this support package because they cannot possibly afford a rate increase as a result of Cyclone Yasi.</Hansard-Body>

In the area of energy, Powerlink continues to fund its replacement of the 132 kVA line with a 275 kVA line between Cairns and Townsville, and the $121 million upgrade of the section between Yabulu and Ingham is progressing. Powerlink has also made allocations this year to upgrade the high-voltage transmission line between Ingham and Cardwell and between Cardwell and Tully. Both of these sections have $63 million allocated to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077359"></A>
I welcome the ongoing investment by Stanwell Corporation in upgrades to the Kareeya hydroelectric power station, west of Tully, which is an important part of North Queensland’s electricity infrastructure network. This year that investment will be $1.2 million. I am pleased that Stanwell continues to make regular allocations for the maintenance and upgrades at Kareeya as the power station is an important employer in the Tully district. I would note that Stanwell also has a positive relationship with Tully State High School, supporting bursaries for and offering career pathways to local students attending that school.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077363"></A>
In the area of education, I am concerned about an apparent cut of $300,000 from the capital budget to construct a new kindergarten at Bluewater State School on Townsville’s growing northern beaches. It appears that the allocation of $1.5 million in last year’s budget has fallen to $1.2 million in this year’s budget. This needs to be explained by the Minister for Education.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077365"></A>
Once again, I want to raise the issue of the need for a new primary school to be constructed in the near future to service the rapidly growing area of the northern beaches of Townsville. Residential growth on the northern beaches in my electorate--in North Shore, Burdell, Bushland Beach and Mount Low--is still very strong. Education Queensland needs to plan properly for this growth. Incidentally, the state primary school that currently services this area, Bohlevale State School, is celebrating its centenary this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077371"></A>
There is an allocation of $6.3 million in the budget for the replacement of B block at Tully State High School which was destroyed by Cyclone Yasi. However, it is not due to be spent until 2012. There are no capital allocations in the budget for the repair and refurbishment of D block, the manual arts block and other facilities at Tully State High School. However, I have had some preliminary advice from the Minister for Education that this work will come from an NDRRA claim. I accept that preliminary advice and give an undertaking to my constituents to monitor this situation closely.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077374"></A>
Regarding the environment, I am pleased to find that the allocation for a new Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service ranger station has reappeared in this year’s budget papers, three years after it was originally announced. The cost of this project has blown out from $620,000 to over $1 million. After originally being announced in the 2008-09 budget, the proposed QPWS ranger station in Cardwell disappeared from the budget papers and was not constructed in the 2009-10 or the 2010-11 financial year. For three years this commitment by the Bligh government has gone nowhere. The QPWS employees in Cardwell were promised this facility three years ago. The three years worth of delays has seen the project increase in cost by $400,000. The Bligh government plans to spend $3.6 million over the coming financial year to increase the size of the national park estate in Queensland and yet it has still not spent the funds that it promised three years ago to build a new QPWS ranger station in Cardwell. I do not believe the Bligh government can justify increasing Queensland’s national park estate by 350,000 hectares over the next 12 months when it has failed to deliver the basic infrastructure required to maintain existing protected areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077375"></A>
In the area of health, I feel compelled, once again, to express my concern that the Bligh government has failed to recognise that many rural and regional Queenslanders continue to be disadvantaged by its refusal to increase the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme. The withdrawal of services from smaller hospitals in my electorate such as Ingham and Tully means more patients are required to travel long distances to Townsville or Cairns for basic health services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077412"></A>
It is not just the cents per kilometre subsidy that is inadequate but also the accommodation subsidy. The process involved in applying for the subsidy is also very complicated. This poses difficulties for many people for whom the subsidy is important to be able to afford treatment, such as those on low and fixed incomes. The removal of the fuel tax rebate by the Bligh government means transport costs have increased for patients, many of whom have chronic illnesses. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1077415"></A>
I turn now to the portfolio of agriculture, food and regional Queensland, for which I have shadow ministerial responsibility for the opposition. With all the political rhetoric in his budget speech about the Bligh government supposedly planning for and looking to the future, the Treasurer all but ignored agriculture, mentioning it only as a traditional strength of the Queensland economy that has been affected by the recent natural disasters. The Treasurer also mentioned the mining and tourism sectors as traditional strengths of the state’s economy affected by Queensland’s recent floods and Cyclone Yasi. The Treasurer mentioned them again later in his speech in terms of the government’s support for them and their forecasted contribution to Queensland’s future. The Treasurer talked at length about the resources sector, particularly the LNG industry and its importance for Queensland’s future. The Treasurer reaffirmed Labor’s commitment to tourism as part of the state’s future economic framework. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077416"></A>
In contrast, agriculture was completely left out of the Treasurer’s grand vision for Queensland’s future economic prosperity. Mining, tourism and agriculture were all badly affected by the floods and Cyclone Yasi but only agriculture was passed over in Labor’s future plans. This is a perfect example of the difference between Labor and the LNP. The LNP sees agriculture as part of Queensland’s future; Labor considers agriculture to be part of the state’s past. The Treasurer’s budget speech makes this attitude very clear. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077417"></A>
I wish the resources sector and the tourism industry well. They are indeed traditional strengths of the Queensland economy. However, I believe that, while agriculture has been a pillar of the state’s economy over the last 150 years, it is also critical to Queensland’s future. The release yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies of a draft food policy for Queensland, a worthy initiative, will count for little if the Bligh government does not see agriculture as an important part of the state’s economy. A strong agricultural sector diversifies and strengthens Queensland’s economy. It earns vital export dollars for the state and underpins the economy of many regional and rural communities. Queensland needs a strong and profitable agricultural sector that is supported by the state government at least to the same extent that it will support those other traditional pillars of the economy--mining and tourism. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1077419"></A>
Queensland’s agricultural colleges have achieved outcomes above budgeted expectations but have not been rewarded for this success, having their capital allocation cut again in the budget papers tabled on Tuesday this week by the Treasurer. The budget papers reported that the Australian Agricultural College Corporation achieved an increase in completed qualifications of 24 per cent above 2009-10 levels and delivered more than the targeted hours of vocational education and training in the agricultural sector last year. Despite increasing the number of people completing qualifications in agriculture and delivering more than the expected number of hours of training, the capital funding to the college will actually decrease by $167,000, from $3.167 million to $3 million. Furthermore, despite the Bligh government stating that the Australian Agricultural College Corporation is aiming to increase the number of sites across the state where it delivers training, the budget papers indicate that staff numbers have fallen by 20 full-time equivalents over the last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077423"></A>
The Bligh government has set out high hopes for the AACC in the budget papers, with the Service Delivery Statement for DEEDI outlining goals that include growth in full-time residential training, creating partnerships with schools and developing new models of training such as cadetships, amongst others. The steady decline in core funding and staff at Queensland’s agricultural colleges indicates that these worthy goals will be much harder to achieve. To do so, the AACC will have to do more and more with less and less. This is not the mark of a government that takes rural training seriously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077426"></A>
Careers in agriculture can be rewarding. There is currently a shortage of skilled people available to work in agriculture. Investment in training and our educational institutions is the key to addressing this problem, not slowly starving them of core funding and staff. The sale of agricultural college campuses at Dalby and in the Burdekin by the Bligh government will prove to be a short-sighted decision that ignores the current major challenge facing Queensland to deliver sufficient skilled workers for the agricultural sector, a recognised pillar of the state’s economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077428"></A>
The budget contains more words than dollars for the agricultural sector, with strategies, plans and reports outnumbering new investment announcements. There are few new capital allocations to reassure agricultural industries that the Bligh government is interested in ensuring that it has a positive, vibrant future in Queensland, particularly in driving economic growth in the state’s regional and rural communities. DEEDI’s Service Delivery Statement includes the Regionalisation Strategy, the Biosecurity Strategy, the Industry Supply Chain Recovery Plan, the Queensland Timber Plantation Strategy, and the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland rural skills and training demand report</Hansard-Italic>
. However, the Capital Statement only lists the same projects that were in last year’s budget, such as the Food Sciences Precinct at Coopers Plains, the 2020 Beef plan, the biosecurity lab at JCU and the Darling Downs Cropping Research and Training Centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077438"></A>
I am not criticising the development of those strategies, plans and reports, and I am not criticising those capital allocations that were carried over from last year’s budget to this year’s budget. It is always important to plan ahead, engage with the relevant stakeholders and have goals for the future. I am just hoping that all of these words will translate into some action. I am not filled with confidence because the current projects in the budget are falling behind or going nowhere. The Darling Downs Cropping Research and Training Centre has stalled, for example, because it is dependent on the sale of the Dalby agricultural college. I am surprised DEEDI included its fire ant and Asian bee responses as a highlight of the department’s service delivery in the budget given the fire ant program has struggled badly and the Asian bee program has been described as ‘unlikely to succeed’. Queensland has had a terrible season of floods and Cyclone Yasi. While QRAA expenses have been many times more than what was budgeted for last year, natural disaster assistance to farmers cannot stand in for real support for agriculture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077441"></A>
The shadow Treasurer, the member for Clayfield, outlined in his budget reply an alternative agenda of initiatives on behalf of the LNP. The shadow Treasurer tore apart the Bligh government’s economic and financial record, pointing out that after 20 years in government Labor had achieved a record debt, lost the AAA credit rating, sold off the state’s assets and failed to stand up for Queensland against federal Labor taxes undermining our economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077444"></A>
In addition to exposing Labor’s failings, the member for Clayfield outlined a number of initiatives that an incoming Newman LNP government would implement to reduce the cost-of-living pressures on households and businesses. First, the LNP opposes Labor’s 125 per cent increase in transfer duty on family homes and would reintroduce the principal place of residence concession. Second, the LNP will freeze the standard domestic tariff, tariff 11, providing savings to consumers of around $120 a year. Along with the abolition of Labor’s ambulance levy from power bills, this will provide some relief to Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077445"></A>
The shadow Treasurer also made it clear the LNP would stand up for the rights of the state of Queensland by strongly opposing federal Labor’s carbon tax and in government support a High Court challenge to federal Labor’s minerals resource rent tax. Lastly, the LNP is committed to restoring the authority of the Coordinator-General to properly coordinate major infrastructure projects that will create the foundation on which the Queensland economy will grow, addressing two decades of neglect by Labor. </Hansard-Body>

(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Employment, Skills and Mining) (4.39 pm): The 2011-12 budget rebuilds Queensland while helping families with the cost of living. It locks in the spending that will build back better Queensland communities. It sees the abolition of the ambulance levy, saving some 1.4 million Queensland families and small businesses $113 off their electricity bills. </Hansard-Body>

I note the bleatings of a number of members opposite about this particular measure. This measure, as was the levy in its day, represents progress. If those opposite had their way, the Chermside Local Ambulance Committee--an institution I am very proud to be the patron of--would still be running community fundraising for basic services to supplement the subscription, rather than using these activities to enhance their services. They would be back to fundraising for basic services, and that is disgraceful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081873"></A>
This budget also delivers a concessions pack totalling almost $1.4 billion, including big increases to electricity rebates, the pensioner rates rebate and South-East Queensland water subsidy schemes--which are all very important to many of my constituents. This pack includes: for the pensioner rates rebate, an 11.11 per cent increase to $200 for pensioner homeowners off gross rates and charges levied by local councils; for the South-East Queensland water subsidy, a 20 per cent increase to $120 each year off the cost of water access and volumetric usage charges; and for the Electricity Rebate Scheme, a 6.6 per cent increase to $230 off the cost of their domestic electricity supply each and every year. </Hansard-Body>

Turning to my portfolio, the Bligh government has invested some $104.5 million in the continuation of the very successful Skilling Queenslanders for Work program. This program will help 24,000 job seekers into work. The Bligh government has renewed our commitment to managing abandoned historic mines with $24 million. The Bligh government has delivered a total skills and training budget of some $1.3 billion. The Bligh government will continue to work with Skills Queensland as it delivers a $50 million strategic investment fund to partner with industry on skills training. </Hansard-Body>

When it comes to helping people in the Stafford electorate, this budget delivers for the north side. Small measures are often overlooked when we discuss billion dollar budgets and million dollar projects, but these measures are very important in my electorate. They make a real difference to particular communities and particular community institutions. That is why students, parents and the community will soon be able to enjoy some upgraded facilities at two local schools thanks to a $120,000 investment in better facilities. We will invest $100,000 in upgrading the car park at the Stafford Heights State School. After the great improvement that has come with their recently opened BER project, this car park will make a huge difference to the way the school operates. I know that Tammy Robinson, the president of the Stafford Heights P&amp;C, is very appreciative of this measure. The $20,000 funding to resurface the tennis courts at the Somerset Hills State School is ideal for keeping our youngsters fit and active. I know that Ian Carmody, the president of the Somerset Hills P&amp;C, is very appreciative of this. He raised this measure with me as a concern and I was very pleased to be able to deliver on it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081888"></A>
I grew up on the north side of Brisbane. I did the whole of my schooling there and now my children are going to school there. Our community values our local teachers and schools and I am proud to see this responsive investment. I want to thank the Treasurer and the Minister for Education for listening to my representations and providing students in the community with first-class facilities for our schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081890"></A>
The budget will also help provide funding for transport, health and infrastructure. We are delivering better public transport, with $93.7 million to continue building the Northern Busway to Kedron and provisions to plan the next stage to Chermside and Bracken Ridge of that great piece of public transport infrastructure. There is also continued budgetary commitments for the new children’s emergency department at the Prince Charles Hospital, which is a very important improvement in the context of delivering the Queensland Children’s Hospital. This is further evidence of the Queensland government delivering on its priorities for the north side--traditional Labor priorities of improving health and education services and addressing the cost-of-living pressures on working families and fixed income households. </Hansard-Body>

I am pleased to see that there are some very good outcomes for the Sunnybank electorate in this year’s budget. Over $6 million has been allocated to commence intersection improvements at Miles Platting Road, Padstow Road and Logan Road. This intersection, which I use daily, has some very long waiting times due to the growth in our suburbs, and I know that local residents will be prepared to endure the necessary roadworks and delays while this project is undertaken. Work will commence early next year and should take six months and will lead to reduced congestion and better crossings for pedestrians and cyclists. We have recently upgraded the Padstow Road and Warrigal Road intersection so this will finish the worst of the traffic problems in the Eight Mile Plains area.</A></Hansard-Body>

Work is also about to begin on the upgrade of the Kessels Road and Mains Road intersection, with the successful tenderer soon to be announced. The planning for this $300 million upgrade has taken many years. It is a project that the state government is delivering with federal government money. Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister committed the funding to this project and I am sure generations of motorists will be grateful that he made our local problem a priority. The state has now completed the compulsory acquisitions and this project--which I know many long time locals thought would never be achieved--is due to commence in January next year.</Hansard-Body>

Before my election to parliament, I was a secondary teacher and one of the reasons I was motivated to run for public office was to see improvements in our education system. Labor governments have always made education a priority for public spending. Ever since the Whitlam government first funded high school libraries and science blocks, Labor governments have allocated the funds and introduced the big reforms that have been required to ensure that our educational standards are of world standard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081911"></A>
The schools in my electorate have all enjoyed improvements to their physical environment, and I believe teachers are tackling the challenges of change in delivering a modern day curriculum. We need to do more to minimise disadvantage. One only needs to drive 10 minutes around my electorate from Macgregor to Acacia Ridge to see the difference between advantage and disadvantage displayed in an educational sense. Julia Gillard’s MySchool results confirm what teachers already know--that, notwithstanding some terrific work and results in disadvantaged areas, results are pretty much postcode based. The challenge has always been to ensure education provides an opportunity for anyone to attain their full potential, and that means young people from disadvantaged backgrounds need additional attention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081912"></A>
The majority of my teaching was in Logan city schools so I know how important this is. It has been the Labor governments of the last 20 years that have modernised and transformed the educational system in this state. The Goss government introduced the study of languages into our primary schools and started the big spend on computers. The Beattie government introduced the full-time prep year to give our children 13 years of formal schooling, and now the Bligh government is allocating unprecedented funds to early childhood education and starting the transition of year 7 students to high school.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081913"></A>
This budget has $2.22 million for Acacia Ridge early childhood education and care and funds six separate maintenance works at the Acacia Ridge State School. If we are going to ensure that education really does give everyone an equal chance to explore their full potential, then focusing on the early years is the essential first step. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1081915"></A>
Like other members of parliament, I have spent the last 18 months attending openings of the magnificent new school halls, libraries and classrooms. Schools like Coopers Plains State School, which is small and not affluent, could never have imagined they would have a brand-new purpose-built school hall. The same could be said for the Aboriginal and Islander Independent Community School or St Thomas More College or just about every other school in my electorate. They are all enjoying facilities that have given a real boost in morale to teachers, parents and students. </Hansard-Body>

International education is a key export industry to the state’s economy. It is always in the top five largest industries getting Queensland important export dollars. It is a relatively robust industry but it is not one we should take for granted. We are in competition with North American and European markets and they also have good products to sell. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081955"></A>
Government policies which promote this industry over the last 20 years have seen overseas students in our high schools, universities and private colleges. At present I am completing an MBA at Griffith University and our classes are made very lively by students from Asia, South America and the Arab countries. They offer different and interesting viewpoints on just about every subject. Given that our world, particularly our business world, is increasingly internationalised, it is important that we are skilled at engaging with people from different cultural and language backgrounds. </Hansard-Body>

The electorate of Mount Gravatt that I represented for 19 years and now the electorate of Sunnybank that I have represented for over two years have much in common. They are both increasingly multicultural. Our focus on international education is one of the reasons for this multiculturalism. Migrants come to this country and to this state because they want to give their children better educations and better lives. I recently quizzed two South African doctors who are of Indian background about why they chose Queensland given they had the choice to live and work in many countries in the world. They told me that they did their homework very thoroughly and chose Queensland because they determined it was one of the safest places you could live in the world. It is interesting to hear these stories because we probably do not think of our community in those terms.</Hansard-Body>

When I step out of my electorate office, which is in the heart of Sunnybank, it feels like I am in Asia. We should be proud of the multicultural community we have created in suburbs like Sunnybank, Eight Mile Plains and Acacia Ridge. I live in this community; my children grew up and went to school here. The Wu brothers along with the Ngyuen brothers have grown up in our home. My husband is German and my son has recently married a Japanese woman, and we are typical of our community. Almost 40 per cent of the people who live in my electorate were born overseas. I would not have had the good fortune to win eight elections if I had not had the strong support of the multicultural communities I represent. The Chinese, Indian, Islamic, Polynesian, Spanish speaking and various African communities have been very generous in inviting me to their celebrations and their homes and sharing their views on the world. I have made many friends and I am looking forward to spending more time with them post politics.</Hansard-Body>

The biggest new initiative in my electorate in this year‘s budget is the $24.8 million of funds to commence building at the SkillsTech Australia Acacia Ridge campus. Money spent on this TAFE is vital to ensure the future of apprentices and trades in Queensland. The Acacia Ridge training centre of SkillsTech Australia has 7,133 students, which includes 4,252 apprentices, 198 overseas students, 156 teachers and 241 support staff. It is the biggest trainer of apprentices in Queensland and it is no surprise that other countries are sending their apprentices here to be trained, because we have some of the most skilled teachers in the world at this TAFE and we have built state-of-the-art buildings and have provided training machinery and equipment that is cutting edge. Every building at this college is environmentally sustainable. For example, rainwater is gathered from the extensive roof system into large tanks. The building design of the new $20 million electrical, refrigeration and air-conditioning training facility incorporates 90 solar panels, putting power back into the grid. It will be wonderful to see how this money we have allocated in this year’s budget will be used to provide a light automotive training centre and an engineering building, as well as a resource canteen and client services.</Hansard-Body>

The QEII Hospital is in my electorate and I am regularly visiting people there. Last month I took a friend to the emergency department on a Sunday afternoon. The care she received was outstanding. The doctors and nurses were professional, friendly and caring. I hear only praise about the quality of care that people get at the QEII and I take this opportunity on behalf of our community to thank them for the work they do. State and Commonwealth money has recently been announced to upgrade the QEII emergency department. It will be completely remodelled, with 11 new fast-track bays created and additional short-stay beds. </Hansard-Body>

This year’s Health budget will exceed $11 billion. We will again spend more on new health facilities than any other state. We have the largest Health building program in Australia. I know that people’s expectations of a modern, free health system are very high and we are still paying for the decades when we failed to train enough doctors, particularly enough specialists, but I believe the Labor governments I have been part of have made improving our hospitals and health system generally one of their highest priorities.</Hansard-Body>

The QEII Hospital is now running a hospital-at-home program. I want to share with the House a letter I received from a constituent about this service, and the health minister might be interested in this letter. My constituent said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081973"></A>
Rather than being admitted to hospital, I was informed I would be treated on site and further treatment would be provided at my home via the hospital at home program. I was given a brochure explaining the program and describing my particular infection.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081974"></A>
Treatment would begin the following day by a qualified nurse and appropriate visits by a doctor who would communicate by phone and discuss time and day for each treatment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1081975"></A>
He says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081977"></A>
... at 2 pm the hospital at home nurse arrived, took a blood sample for testing and administered antibiotics by intravenous drugs</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081978"></A>
... at 2.30 pm the doctor arrived and arranged for an ultra sound scan at Sunnybank Private Hospital the following day</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081979"></A>
Each day for the next 5 days I received treatment by qualified nurses and several visits by the doctor, culminating with an appointment with a specialist.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081980"></A>
I cannot offer sufficient praise for the hospital at home program. The personnel involved are very professional in the medical treatment they provide, respectful of my wife and of our home and very co-operative with me, their patient.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081981"></A>
I would like to congratulate the government on this new innovation to the medical health system and one which I most certainly approve as it provides excellent care to those with limited mobility, reduces the stress on our hospitals and frees hospital beds so that more urgent cases may be serviced. Please support hospital at home as much as you can.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I recently attended the opening of our $7 million expansion of the state government’s forensic centre at Coopers Plains. Many people will remember that it was not so long ago that we were troubled by a DNA testing backlog, and this was delaying court cases and even delaying the solving of some crimes. I am pleased to report that, because of our investment in this facility, there are no longer any delays and we now have the best testing laboratories in Australia. These labs also identify missing persons and our forensic scientists recently assisted with identifying people who tragically died in the floods. Without them, families would have potentially spent their lives wondering about the fate of loved ones.</Hansard-Body>

There is $54.9 million in this year’s budget to continue developing the new Police Academy at Wacol. The new academy, which is already being used by police, will become fully operational by 2014. It is a project which I began as police minister, along with Commissioner Bob Atkinson, because we realised that the Oxley academy had outlived the training needs of a modern police force and because we had a vision to create a world-class academy which would be the best in the Southern Hemisphere. It will mean we will be well placed to market our police training to Asia-Pacific countries. It will build on our reputation of being a provider of world-class education in every walk of life.</Hansard-Body>

As this is likely to be the last speech before I retire that offers me an opportunity for broad range observations, I want to take the time to put on the public record my thanks to the many people who have stood by my side during my time in politics, firstly my husband, Heinz. Heinz has taken care of our children and me so that I could do this job for a long time now. He has fed us and washed our clothes and located our lost things and been there to run us all around while himself holding down a job. My children, Lucas and Jack, have never known a time when their mother was not a politician. I know that they are very proud of me, but it has not always been easy for them to see their mum in the public spotlight. But they are hugely successful people and it seems that no damage has been done. My mother, Gwen, and my sisters, who all look a bit like me and have had to answer for me sometimes, have lived this public life with me and they have been great.</Hansard-Body>

I have had so many wonderful staff members. They cannot all be mentioned, but I have to mention Kerry Humphreys--also known as ‘The Goddess’--who has been my PA for 13 years. She is a legend in the Labor Party. She has worked for us since 1983. Kerry, you helped keep it together for me. Thank you. I have been very privileged to work with people like Geoff Allan, Simon Tutt, Paige Armstrong, Ian Lang, Fiona Reynolds, Fiona Kennedy, Ross McSwain, Paul Loney, John Francis, Elvin Kempnich and so many, many others. Over the years the electorate staff have changed, but Chris and Jodi, who are with me now, are wonderful. I want to make particular mention of two of my colleagues--Barbara Stone, the member for Springwood, who was once my electorate officer, and my colleague of 22 years Robert Schwarten. Ours has been an extraordinary friendship in modern politics and we have been lucky to have each other to share problems and come up with creative solutions to them. Everyone needs friends in the workplace, and politics is no different. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1082001"></A>
Many Labor Party branch members have been working to support me over 20 years--John and Margaret O’Donnell, Shirley and Ron Wilmott, Brian and Mary Dutton and hundreds more. My good friend Bernie Dawson has become part of our family. She and her late mother, Trisha, have been my mentors and support people every step of the way. Not many people get to choose the time of their departure from this job, and I count myself very fortunate to leave on my own terms. </Hansard-Body>

One of the negatives in the life of the modern-day politician is that the constant demands on your time leave little time for the level of consideration we should all give to the laws we pass. The new committee system that this parliament established this week heralds a new era of change. We are the first parliament in Australia to send every piece of legislation to a committee for consideration before it is debated and passed in the parliament. We are the first parliament in the country that will give the public the opportunity to comment on every piece of legislation before it is discussed in this House. I hope that my legacy of chairing the committee that recommended these remarkable reforms will be a positive one. </Hansard-Body>

In the future, members are going to have to devote more of their time to their legislative duties. Even if that means they do not get to every monthly meeting that they currently attend, I think Queenslanders will be grateful that their elected representatives are across the detail of the laws they pass rather than come into the parliament and make some general observations. The new system will only be as good as the members of parliament make it. It can offer the people of Queensland unprecedented participation in their democracy.</Hansard-Body>

As one of the people who was at the forefront of the movement to get more women elected to parliament in the 1990s, I am proud of the fact that women have comprised about 35 per cent of our representatives for over a decade now. I am convinced that our political parties in Queensland have to do more to embrace the diversity in our population. Our parliaments are meant to reflect the diversity of the communities we represent and the Queensland parliament is a long way from doing that. I continue to encourage people from our multicultural communities to get involved in politics and I hope we are going to see more of them get elected to represent us in the future.</Hansard-Body>

I want to thank the people from the Mount Gravatt and Sunnybank electorates for continuing to put their confidence in me to represent them. The best thing about the job is the wonderful people you meet every day. I still love hearing the stories of people who come into my office or whom I meet in the community, and it is great when you have some wins and you can help them out. The job is about service and leadership and I hope that I have proven adequate in both respects. </Hansard-Body>

This budget is not going to please everyone, but I think it has enough new initiatives to see strong business investment in this state, to see job creation continue and to ensure that our most vulnerable are given the support they need. It recognises the need for bold incentives to encourage and support people to get into first home ownership and it gives a boost to the tourism and building industries. I am pleased to support it. </Hansard-Body>

It is a budget that will help young people get a foot in the door of a newly built home and it helps others upgrade to a new home. It also helps cut the cost of living by abolishing the community ambulance cover and helps pensioners with electricity and water prices. The budget has significant funding for rebuilding after the flood, which damaged hundreds of homes and units from Bundamba to Gailes. </A></Hansard-Body>

For people in my electorate who want to buy a newly constructed home or sign a contract to build a new home, from 1 August this year and for six months only they will be eligible for a $10,000 grant from our Labor government.

A brand-new fire station will be built at Ripley, replacing the Ipswich station. It will be a modern, state-of-the-art station. An amount of $31.49 million has been allocated for improvements to the Swanbank gas fired power station, including overhauls. An amount of $488,000 has been allocated to replace the existing transformer at Cooneana with a larger unit and for an upgrade of high-voltage switch gear at a total cost of $8.7 million.

Goodna was heavily affected during the January floods. Working together with the Departments of Communities, Queensland Health, Queensland Sport and Recreation, Public Works and other State departments, we were able to rebuild the Goodna Rugby League Club and help the community through this tragic time. The Leagues Club now hosts the Community Recovery Centre one day per week. The other days it is located at Max Employment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Queensland Health was magnificent during the flood. Nurses established a mobile tetanus clinic and assisted with wounds for volunteers who helped clean houses and shops. More than 2,800 tetanus injections were provided to volunteers during this time. As well, social workers, mental health nurses and supplies to St. John’s Ambulance were made available in the Goodna community. Queensland Health continues this work at the Goodna Health Centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In all, five new schools have opened in our electorate this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1090453"></A>
I stand up for everyone, including the poorest and most disadvantaged in our community. I try to help everyone and in doing so, I try to empower them to help themselves and believe in their own ability to achieve.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1090455"></A>
Yes, I rattle the can. Yes, I stand for Labor values. I am proud to deliver on these values and principles. Yes I bring up issues that others would never dare--but I do so because I love our community. I want the very best for our people, our families and our elderly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1090456"></A>
Now more than ever I want to make sure that people who were affected during the floods get the help they need to get their lives back to normal. As a community, we do care for each other and when people need help we should be there to meet their needs. After all, that is what community is about. And that is what our Labor government is about.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1090457"></A>
And as your State member of Parliament, I will keep on fighting for our community, keep on getting more than our fair share of the budget and standing up for what is right for all of us. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.05 pm): I rise to speak to the Appropriation Bill, the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill and the Community Ambulance Cover Levy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. It is with much pleasure that I rise to speak on behalf of my constituents. To understand where we have come from in terms of the budget, we really have to go back almost 20 years to when Wayne Goss was the Premier and Kevin Rudd was his chief of staff and when they cancelled the Wolffdene Dam. In terms of a surplus budget in Queensland, that was the beginning of the end. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_06_17_DAILY-80.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090481"></A>
This budget is unprecedented in that it has brought in a deficit of $4 billion--$4 billion borrowed to maintain this state for the next 12 months. When the Wolffdene Dam was cancelled, it put in place an issue that Queensland has faced ever since--that is, we did not build a water supply for Brisbane as it grew in comparison with other cities in Queensland and, more importantly, for the number of people who were settling in Brisbane and using the water supply. When we had a drought, which is not uncommon in Queensland, the then Premier, Peter Beattie, made a very hurried decision while on a flight over the Mary Valley to build a dam at Traveston.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090482"></A>
Basically, that is where this budget sits. The government then went through the process of buying land at Traveston and ultimately built a water grid in Brisbane. The cost of that water grid was astronomical. It was built at a time when all of the contractors throughout Queensland--or throughout Australia, for that matter--were heavily involved in building construction and mining ventures. Indeed, it was almost impossible to get contractors. Quite frankly, it was a standing joke among contractors that the Queensland government was a good bet: all they needed to do was submit an invoice and they would get paid on it. The cost of a lot of the projects was blowing out by millions of dollars. It certainly set up a lot of contractors around Queensland who were able to partake in the luxury of tendering for a government contract. The buying of land and properties in the Traveston Dam area in the Mary Valley and ultimately the resale of those properties has caused a huge hole in Queensland’s finances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090483"></A>
I refer also to a lot of the projects that were developed in this 20-year period of the Labor government, such as the Stanwell light metals project, which the Queensland government was involved in with private enterprise. That cost this government quite an amount of money, as it did a lot of private investors, who were mums and dads and in some cases even pensioners, who put their money into that project and thought it was going to get off the ground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090548"></A>
One can talk about a whole lot of projects in that 20-year period that have cost this government very dearly. All of the projects funded under the auspice of the Smart State gimmick, I guess you could call it, and then Q2 cost this state dearly. The $4 billion deficit in this budget is a combination of all of these issues. The $80 billion odd that we have in debt currently is part and parcel of bad decisions that have been made over more than 20 years. Some will say that the Liberal National Party were in power for a little over two years. That is correct. In that time we did a survey of dam sites right throughout Queensland. There is a very substantial project book somewhere on the shelves gathering dust that will identify all of the dam sites right around Queensland that could easily have been built in the 20 years that this government has been in power. If they had been built we possibly would not have the huge burden of debt that we currently have. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090551"></A>
We are also seeing in this budget the removal of the QAS levy tax that was imposed when I was the shadow minister for emergency services. Mike Reynolds was the minister. I remember clearly the debate with regard to that matter. I almost pleaded with the minister to not bring in that tax. It was so unfair in that it was a tax on the electricity bill. There were exceptions for pensioners and Seniors Card holders and their dependants, which there had to be, but the reality is that there were many people who were paying that levy many times over. Indeed, in the time that I was the shadow I can recollect receiving an email from a person who was actually paying that levy 22 times. He had billboards on the side of the highway and every one of those billboards had a power metre on it. There were cases similar to that all over Queensland. It was an unfair tax and should never have been put on. Listening to the debate here in the parliament over the last couple of days in respect of that levy one would swear that this government was doing taxpayers a great turn and that it can gain some virtue out of the fact that it is taking the tax over. I ask members opposite to remember that it was their government that put it on to start with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090552"></A>
We are seeing huge increases in vehicle registration, but the doozy of them all is an increase of 125 per cent in stamp duty on family homes. That is a similar issue to the QAS tax. Real estate is doing it tough right throughout Queensland. In the Rockhampton-Mackay region real estate agents are telling me that it is very tough trying to sell homes. This will result in an increase of between $5,000 and $7,000 in the cost of a transaction. Due to the mining industry in that area there are a lot of people moving in buying homes and there are others moving out selling homes and, of course, a lot of people upgrading their homes. A lot of people are renting now rather than buying homes because they are concerned about the future of the mining industry with the introduction of a carbon tax and rising interest rates. We have heard the chairman of the Reserve Bank indicate that there could possibly be an increase in interest rates in the near future. That certainly is having a real impact on people borrowing money to buy homes. This stamp duty will be another impact on those people who are trying to buy a home. It certainly will have a huge impact on real estate agents. I believe it will cost the state government more than it actually thinks it will receive. There will be less turnover in houses and ultimately less return to the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090553"></A>
I believe that with the combination of all of those issues, along with the issues of the cost of power and the fuel tax, the cost of maintaining a lifestyle for people with families, retired people, people who have actually set aside funds to be self-funded retirees, has gone through the roof under this government. I believe that this government has lost its way. I believe it is out of control and out of touch, not only with the general population but the grassroots of its party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090554"></A>
We have seen the contentious issue of asset sales worth $17 billion. The prime assets of Queensland--QR, the motorways, Forestry Queensland, the airports and ports--have been sold. That has created a loss of income to the state government. Those sales have not really made any difference to the bottom line. Before the sale of assets it was predicted that we would be looking at $85 billion of debt--$85 billion of debt, I say again. Indeed, I wonder where we would be if we did not have the proceeds from those asset sales? Would it be $100 billion of debt that we would now be carrying if it was not for those asset sales? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090555"></A>
We have a $4 billion deficit this year. The amount of money that is needed to cover the interest on $85 billion in debt amounts to $595,000 per hour. We will pay $100 million per week in interest on that debt. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to work out that in about three or four weeks the government could build a fairly substantial hospital, a couple of schools, pay hundreds of nurses, ambulance officers and police et cetera. The dead hand of debt is on this government. The dead hand of debt is on Queensland. Sooner or later the children of the people sitting here in this chamber--and their children’s children--will be facing this debt. There is no way that this government and any future government can actually write off $85 billion of debt. That money has to be earned over and above the interest every day that we are paying that amount of interest. That will be very, very difficult to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090556"></A>
After 20 years of Labor in this state we are in a position now where for at least a generation and possibly longer we will be facing huge interest payments on a debt that has been accumulated over those 20 years. New South Wales, which was obviously a basket case, did not lose its AAA rating. Late at night we watch the news from America and the problems it has had with debt over there. It still holds a AAA rating. One wonders in hindsight what measures this Labor administration has taken over 20 years to put us in this position. This has occurred at a time when we have been generating huge amounts of royalty income from the mining industry. Still we find ourselves in this position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090557"></A>
The bottom line on the budget does not even take into consideration the carbon tax. On the nightly news we see that Julia Gillard is very keen and is saying that we will have a price on carbon. A price on carbon will be a killer in the area that I represent. The coalmining industry in Central Queensland and the aluminium smelter at Gladstone will be hugely affected by a price on carbon. Any price on carbon will certainly affect the huge secondary industry that we have in Mackay which employs thousands of workers. That is not even factored into this budget. As I have said, we have a $4 billion deficit and we have not even factored in some sort of carbon tax. At the end of the day, the income that will be wound back from that carbon tax will be astronomical. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095612"></A>
No scientist can tell us that, by putting a price on carbon, we will reduce the temperature of the earth by a single degree. We will wipe out a number of Queensland industries without any guarantee that the tax will change the weather patterns or anything else. In Central Queensland, $40 billion worth of projects are stalled because they have no certainty in terms of the carbon tax. I assure the House that if the carbon tax goes ahead those projects worth $40 billion will not go ahead. </Hansard-Body>

I support what my colleague the member for Toowoomba South said about live cattle export. It is a pity that the truth was not spelt out in the <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
 program and the subsequent publicity surrounding it. In Indonesia, there are 770 abattoirs and less than 10 of those are backyard abattoirs that have problems. Cattle are looked after far better in Indonesia than at any of the feedlots in Australia.

As a cattleman certainly I was distraught watching some of the images on <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
. Indeed, I turned off the program. That is no way to treat animals. If we withdraw from that market, Indonesia will source cattle from Brazil and other countries that are further away, so the cattle will be on ships for longer, and we will have no influence whatsoever over the way in which they are treated when they arrive in Indonesia. We need to stay in that market. We need to look after the people who run the Aboriginal stations in the Northern Territory and North Queensland and we have to maintain the huge amount of infrastructure and investment in those areas. </Hansard-Body>

Cattle that are slaughtered in Indonesia are for the wet market. In most cases, there is no refrigeration in the more remote areas of that country. Obviously, there is no way that cattle can be slaughtered in Australia, frozen and sent to Indonesia to supply the market. Even if we could do that, the cost would be too high. It is about time a few people in this chamber understood what they were talking about. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am ‘moving forward’, which are the words we hear frequently. In my electorate, work has started on the Connors River Dam or Mount Bridget Dam. It will be built to a capacity of 373,000 megalitres, with an estimated high priority yield of 56,400 megalitres a year. This dam needs to be built to full capacity. I am disappointed that we are building it to such a low capacity. My understanding is that it can be built to over 1.1 million megalitres. That dam should supply water required for the Galilee Basin and the further development in the Bowen Basin. I think it is short-sighted of this government not to build that dam to full capacity. As I have indicated earlier in my speech, it is important that we maximise all of our capacities in terms of water supply. In Queensland, the problem with water goes right back to a time when we did not properly plan but made a political decision to cancel a dam in southern Queensland. I believe it is incumbent on this government to revisit the Connors River Dam and ensure that it is built to its full capacity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095625"></A>
In conclusion, I raise an issue that is very dear to my heart, which is the sewerage plant in the small town of Sarina. When the Sarina shire council was planning the sewerage plant, the cost was going to be $8 million with the subsidies that were current at that time. Since the Mackay Regional Council has taken over, the cost has increased to almost $50 million simply because the dead hand of DEEDI has come on board and is insisting that the plant be built to a standard that can supply class A water. It is unrealistic for the government to make this impost on the regional council. Indeed, it is impossible for the regional council to build that plant at that price. It also has to build another sewerage plant and ensure water supplies throughout its regional area. It is about time this government got realistic and made sure that the departments are supporting regional councils, rather than making it more and more difficult for them to supply the needs of their areas. </Hansard-Body>

Over the past decade or so, Queensland has had the great misfortune to suffer a continuous series of economic setbacks. Those setbacks are properly and correctly called the Labor Party. Over this period, Labor has made absolutely no effort to reign in its administrative costs, particularly the size of the bureaucracy and its salary levels that are excessive in contrast to the state’s front-line workforce in education, health and police. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry responded to this year’s budget with concerns that the budget deficit of $2.13 billion for 2010-11 is $600 million higher than the midyear fiscal and economic review released in only February of this year. More troubling, they say, is the budget deficit ballooning out to $4.06 billion in 2011-12, with net debt expected to reach $84.9 billion by 2014-15. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095634"></A>
Much of the general government investment in public non-income assets will be funded by more debt. This budget is less about 2011-12 than it is about 2001-02 and the intervening period of waste, vote buying and administrative incompetence. The state will have to spend close to $2 billion on flood damage repair because it had neither insurance nor adequate contingency reserves, notwithstanding the known extreme cyclical climatic conditions in Queensland. In short, they did not save for a rainy day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095635"></A>
This year’s budget is merely the mouth of a financial blackhole, not an exceptional one-off natural disaster. Labor’s answer is that everything will be better in the coming years, we just have to wait and it will happen. Clearly there is no intention to reduce expenditure or deal with out-of-control rising costs in both the general government or the GOCs, notwithstanding the government’s own admission in last year’s budget that GOCs were in need of reform to improve productivity and profits in line with what would be expected in the private sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095636"></A>
Budget details are merely background noise to the main game, the ever-increasing debt in the general government unfunded debt. The Queensland people are entitled to know what else, other than hoping things will get better, the Treasurer has in mind to address the ideological addiction Labor has to debt, which is unavoidably a massive threat to services and of much higher taxes and prices in the future. </Hansard-Body>

 Both the Tasmanian and South Australian Labor governments have recognised that you cannot live beyond your means. Why not Queensland? Campbell Newman and an LNP government will do what has to be done and will save money and deliver more by taking action on the basics and cutting waste. Queensland’s Premier, Anna Bligh, left the hand-on-heart routine to her Treasurer for this year’s budget. There were no more ‘you can count on me’ pledges; it was a case of flicking the tough stuff to her understudy and hoping the spin works. The Treasurer, the honourable member for Mount Coot-tha, was so nonplussed about this year’s budget or was too embarrassed to even present it that he rose to deliver this most important speech of the year without it in his hands. </Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095677"></A>
The <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 labelled the budget this year as the ‘big steal’ and a Channel 9 poll on Wednesday night revealed that 87 per cent of people thought they would be worse off and a mere 13 per cent thought they would be better off. No matter how reliable this type of poll has proven to be, that is a shocker of a result for the Bligh government and her wonder boy, the Treasurer. The gloss has certainly worn off and it has laid bare these true spin merchants once and for all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095678"></A>
In essence, this budget is no more than the same old misleading and dangerous failure to deal with a major and growing financial problem that Labor has created over almost two decades of self-delusion that that debt will evaporate at some time in the future and that the evil day of reckoning can be deferred indefinitely. Sure, there is a sweetener designed to buy some votes: the ambulance levy will be removed from Queenslanders’ electricity bills as of 1 July this year. Even the Treasurer admitted that this was a regressive levy, and it is one that we on this side of the House argued against when Premier Beattie imposed it on everyone back in 2003.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095680"></A>
However, the real sting for homeowners is in the form of stamp duty, which will almost double in the case of the sale of the average $500,000 home. Real estate agents on the Gold Coast are saying that the state government’s move to scrap the home concession on the transfer duty will lead to job losses, higher rents and lower house values, pushing this already fragile industry over the edge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095681"></A>
Mark my words, this budget will greatly and negatively affect future economic growth and public services in Queensland. Yet we are told by the Treasurer, the Premier and other Labor members, ‘Sit tight. We’re on the way back now. The new wave of prosperity is about to wash over us.’ We have heard all this before: ‘Sell the state’s assets off and all will be fine.’ But it is not, is it? Queenslanders cannot trust a word that this Labor government says. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095682"></A>
Despite selling off $17 billion of assets supposedly to reduce debt, Labor’s mismanagement means that debt will rise further, to $85 billion--or $595,000 an hour or $100 million a week in interest--causing Queenslanders’ cost of living to skyrocket. How many new hospitals, schools and roads could have been built with this money? If the state did not have the monopoly on a variety of taxes and charges, no financial body would lend the Queensland government money. In the private sector, banks would demand that a borrower in such circumstances move quickly to eliminate debt and return to a profitable position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095683"></A>
The state of Queensland’s finances is of even more concern in the still-fragile environment of the global economy which will see continuing downward pressure applied on tax revenues in this country, exaggerated by the attack of the Commonwealth on the profitability of Queensland’s mining industry. Now we hear that the Gillard government will blow $12 million on advertising propaganda for its carbon tax, and the Bligh government is supporting her. Their wasteful spending knows no bounds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095684"></A>
There will be an election in Queensland in the next 12 months. For our part, the LNP will not join Labor in a denial of the terminal seriousness of Queensland’s finances, its lack of direction and long-term policy, and the further use of unfunded debt in another attempt at vote buying based upon deception and dishonesty. Listening to the delusional blubbering of government members blindly espousing the good times ahead, I felt I was witnessing the kind of brainwashing that one reads about relating to cults. I am a ‘glass half full’ person most of the time, but deliberately misleading the public is not only cruel; it is downright dishonest. Every single year we hear a different excuse from this tired Labor government and every year Queensland is plunged further into debt. As honourable members heard from the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Clayfield, the LNP will implement policies to actively save households $250 to $330 per year, including reforms to electricity pricing and a reintroduction of the abolished stamp duty concession. This is on top of our commitment to implement a four-point water plan and freeze the cost of car registration, providing further savings for families.</Hansard-Body>

As the shadow minister for tourism, manufacturing and small business and having run a small business for 25 years, I know too well the dire situation in which many find themselves as a result of this Labor government’s mismanagement of our state’s finances and burdensome red tape. My 15 years experience in consulting directly with the tourism industry gives me a genuine understanding of the effect that this tourism downturn is having. As I travel around our great state listening to small business operators and employees, I hear tale after tale of how red tape and overregulation are crippling our 400,000-plus small business sector. In 2009 alone, this Labor government introduced 68 new acts which created 7,920 pages of new or amended legislation and passed 439 regulations and subordinate legislation at a cost to businesses of $780 million. </Hansard-Body>

While the recent Queensland natural disasters will place significant downward pressure on our State’s economic growth, it is important to realise that Queensland’s economy was facing challenges well before the impact of the recent natural disaster events. Queensland businesses indicate that the floods and Cyclone Yasi will only exacerbate an already difficult business trading environment and that there are a number of other issues undermining the viability of Queensland businesses including the level of demand and economic activity, the level of business taxes and interest rates. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

So what does the Bligh government do to address this, knowing for years that it was going down this spiral? I will tell honourable members what it did. It added another bureaucrat. That is what Labor does. It is spending another $190,000 to $200,000 to establish a Queensland Business Commissioner. On 15 June the Minister for Finance, the Hon. Rachel Nolan, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095695"></A>
By September this year we will appoint Queensland’s first-ever business commissioner, a new position to cut red tape, establish clear time frames for turning around paperwork and work closely with key business representative groups in their strategic priority areas.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1095696"></A>
She continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095698"></A>
... ideally will be someone who can speak the language of both government and business. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095699"></A>
That is right, ‘ideally’; she said ‘ideally’. Surely our business community deserves better. This sounds like an idea that has been quickly thrown together and that, like most things Labor does, has not been properly thought through. It is as though it were looking for Christmas stocking fillers for this budget and had a sudden flash of inspiration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095701"></A>
Likewise, the Minister for Tourism, Manufacturing and Small Business showed her lack of capacity to handle this portfolio by scratching for things in this budget to praise. The honourable member for Whitsunday heralded the establishment of this Business Commissioner as a key announcement, along with the huge wave of prosperity coming our way. Did she not know that DEEDI already produces the Smart Regulation Annual Reports that outline the Queensland Regulatory Simplification Plan and the Regulatory Assessment Statement System and that a small business advisory council already exists? So why is there a need for another bureaucrat? Are these agencies not doing their jobs? The government says that it has a target to cut $150 million from compliance and administration costs by the end of 2012-13, but it is difficult to see how this will be achieved based on its past history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095706"></A>
Our tourism industry has been hit particularly hard, with many long-timers comparing it to the devastation caused by the 1980s pilot strike. Operators want to see some leadership from this government to restore lost confidence. After all, tourism is in the top three money earners for Queensland; it is right up there with mining and agriculture. It creates about $9 billion each year. This government has taken the industry for granted. People in the tourism industry tell me that they are sick and tired of political grandstanding by the minister and the Bligh government, who demand to be the centre of media appearances for every announcement or initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095744"></A>
I found it quite puzzling, therefore, when the minister in her budget reply speech said that the small business, tourism and manufacturing industries were all celebrating news of this budget. However, events funding--which, by the way, does not come out of the Minister for Tourism’s budget--was boosted by $83 million over four years. But the question that is being asked by the <Hansard-Italic>
Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 and by many others in our great state is: how will this support small businesses now? Events planning generally takes several years, as do conferences and exhibitions, not a six- or a 12-month cycle.</Hansard-Body>

Speaking of events, this month the inaugural Cooly Rocks On festival was held. That replaced Wintersun, which moved interstate after 20-plus years. I would like to congratulate Bob Newman, the festival operations manager, and his team for a fantastic effort. Coolangatta and surrounding suburbs rocked for 10 days, attracting upwards of 50,000 people on one day alone. It received an initial $30,000 grant from Events Queensland, and it is to be hoped that this funding can be continued for 2012-13 now that the money has been allocated. </Hansard-Body>

Budget pickings for Currumbin, though, were very slim this year. As usual, the government created a labyrinth system for opposition members to weave through to find budget announcements for their electorates. It is almost impossible to determine what are reannouncements, what is new funding and what is complete fabrication. Most disappointing, though, was the lack of funding for the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary wildlife hospital. Many times in this place I have spoken of this unique and precious facility and its new state-of-the-art hospital that treats over 6,500 injured wildlife annually. It costs about $600,000 a year to run this invaluable community service for South-East Queensland, and without some help it cannot afford to continue for more than a couple of months. This miserly government has never given a cent of funding to the sanctuary, yet it funds others, like Fleays.

The Blair Athol crisis accommodation service has operated since 1978 and is still struggling to cope with the demand for assistance to help the homeless. The number of people and families at risk of homelessness has increased significantly due to the tough economic times and natural disasters. That means an increase in people seeking emergency relief for rental arrears, electricity costs, health and education. Their turn-away rates for individuals--men, women and children--will likely reach 7,000 individuals this year. The budget mentions two grants in Currumbin, but both of these are already in existence and on a three-year funding agreement. They need an increase in funding now. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to take a moment to extend my sincere condolences to the family of Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding and all of the Police Service.

The Queensland Police Union president, Ian Leavers, summed up the tired, long-term Labor government’s commitment to law and order in this year’s budget as the worst police budget in 20 years.

Some five million people traverse Coolangatta Airport annually, highlighting the desperate need for transport options other than cars and buses. Heavy and/or light rail and the widening of the M1 are long overdue. How can anyone believe that the Premier or any of her ministers care one iota about our ailing tourism industry or small business operators when they refuse to build necessary road infrastructure or supply trains? Projects listed in the Capital Statement attempted to deceive Currumbin into thinking the long-awaited, overpromised widening of the daily bottleneck, the M1, is nigh.

This is a fraudulent and bankrupt Labor government that has presided over the state’s finances for the most part of 20 years, and this year’s budget avoids any effort to address the financial crisis facing the state.

This is a major win, and I will continue to make sure that we deliver and that we can provide for our local community. </Hansard-Body>

This builds on $1.2 million that will be delivered this year to extend the turning lane from Wardell Street into Samford Road. This will make travelling times to get home much quicker for those who live in those suburbs. In addition, I also have very exciting news. A further $3.7 million has been allocated to resurface 1.8 kilometres of Wardell Street between Samford Road and Frasers Road, making it much safer for motorists using this road. This is a road I travel a lot, so I know how welcome this funding will be for that local community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095789"></A>
The reason we can do this--the reason we can see the significant investment in our local roads--is that we have a record Main Roads capital works budget this year of $3.4 billion. The reason we can deliver that record investment in Main Roads is that we have made the tough choices that governments with a plan and governments with a real vision have to make to ensure we can deliver these projects locally. </Hansard-Body>

In addition to this, we will see $28,000 spent on constructing a pedestrian-crossing facility at Our Lady of the Assumption School in Hurdcotte Street. This street is very busy because it is also the location of Hillbrook Anglican School. Quite a lot of people use this street during school time and this extra pedestrian crossing will make a big difference to the safety of those young students, some of whom I met again today here at Parliament House when they did their tour. </Hansard-Body>

Because we are a government that believes in public transport and we are a government that continues to spend record funding on getting people on public transport so they can make smarter decisions about the way they travel, I am very pleased to see in this budget that a further $4.5 million will be invested in the new park-and-ride at The Gap. I worked very hard with the previous transport minister to make sure we got funding for this park-and-ride at The Gap. The situation at the moment is dangerous because cars are parking on Waterworks Road after the area that was old water land was closed off, but this park-and-ride at The Gap will solve that with a 70-plus car park. I know that this is something the community at The Gap particularly wants to see, and I am very pleased that this budget delivers on that.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1101207"></A>
One of the things that really motivated me to get into political life and stand up for my community is my passion about education. I know, as many of us in this chamber know, that the best way to change lives is to invest in education, and we have a very strong and proud record of that, particularly in my local community. I have some of the best schools in the state--academically, musically and athletically--in the Ashgrove electorate. This year we have a record Education and Training budget of $10.34 billion. This is a huge investment in the future of our state. These future young lives, these future brains, will power Queensland’s community for years to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101208"></A>
Locally, over $30 million will be spent in schools in the Ashgrove electorate to ensure we do keep that world-class standard of education. Something I am very excited about and something I did lobby the Minister for Education about is funding of $600,000 to upgrade two science laboratories at the Mitchelton State High School. I know that the school has wanted to see this for some time. Recently, the Mitchelton State High School received a new trade training centre from federal government funding. This is creating new opportunities for this school and I am delighted that we can build on this investment at Mitchelton State High School with $600,000 towards these science labs. This will make science more engaging for young people and ensure we have people studying science locally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101212"></A>
Other funding in the education budget locally includes $100,000 to child-care centres to deliver kindergarten programs at the Woods Early Education Centre and Pre-School, The Gap Early Childhood Centre and Community Kids Enoggera and Gaythorne Community Kindergarten and Limited Hours Care. Once again, this is about providing kindergarten quality education in these child-care facilities and it builds on our recent commitment with the brand-new Oakleigh C&amp;K kindergarten, which is now on the Oakleigh State School grounds, and the new The Gap C&amp;K kindergarten that I also recently opened. These are major investments in the young lives of the people in the Ashgrove electorate. As I said, access to high-quality education and state-of-the-art facilities gives children a much better chance of success at school and in their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101220"></A>
The other thing this budget does and which goes to the core of what we on this side of politics have always believed in is that we have provided record funding for disability services, record funding for public housing, record funding for those people who need it most--the most vulnerable people in our community. This year in our local area, over $1 million has been provided to support people with disabilities through Ablecare, and $5.8 million has been provided to support adults with a disability through the Cerebral Palsy League of Queensland, which is based in my electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101222"></A>
We are also delivering $218,000 to complete the construction of one unit of social housing accommodation, and $241,000 is being provided to Communify Queensland through the Home Assist Secure program. This centre is based on Waterworks Road in my electorate. I want to put on the record what a great job Communify does in delivering the Home Assist Secure program. I have worked with them for many years with my history in housing. It is a really great way to keep people with a disability or the elderly in their own homes for as long as possible; it keeps them close to their family, friends and connections and close to the services that they are used to. We want to ensure that people in our community who are in most need have access to the services and support they need to get on with their lives in a positive way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101226"></A>
As the Treasurer said in his budget statement, this maintains our position at the front of the pack when it comes to providing help to those who need a hand with cost of living. We are increasing the local government rates subsidy for pensioners paid by the state to 11 per cent, to $200 per annum. We are increasing our allocation for the subsidy scheme for pensioners and seniors for their electricity costs to $115.6 million this year; this will increase the subsidy for their electricity bills to $230. We are increasing the subsidy for pensioners to reduce their water bills in the Ashgrove electorate by up to $120. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101227"></A>
To deliver major relief for all Queenslanders and everybody who lives in the Ashgrove electorate, we are abolishing the ambulance levy on electricity bills from 1 July--delivering a saving of $113 on electricity bills for everybody in Queensland. This is a strong move by our government to provide relief for people in our local areas, and I am very pleased that residents in my electorate will also benefit from this decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101228"></A>
The funding in the state budget means more assistance and more services to build on those we have already delivered--like the new $2 million Ashgrove Ambulance Station, which provides services to our local community, with 16 paramedics now working out of this new facility. The great news about this new facility in Ashgrove is that many of these paramedics are locals so it actually makes a much better work-life balance for those local staff in my community. As a mum, I know how important it is to know that there are quality ambulance services in our community. As well as delivering emergency care, this new station is providing more support for people with disabilities who need assistance from the Ambulance Service to get to and from hospital for treatment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101229"></A>
We know that quality local infrastructure builds stronger communities. That is why on our side of politics we have made the tough decisions in recent years to make sure we can continue to deliver these local services. This is in stark contrast to when the LNP were last in government in Queensland and they had a capital works freeze and closed The Gap Police Station. The Gap is one of the largest suburbs in Brisbane and the LNP closed our local police station. I am very pleased to say that we reopened that police station and since I have been the member we have also upgraded that police station to provide additional hours of care for my local community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101230"></A>
It is not always the big, multimillion dollar investments that make the difference, though. I am very proud to say that since I became the local member I have worked with our local RSL clubs and we have delivered three new war memorials in my community. The Gap RSL, the Ashgrove RSL and the Gaythorne RSL have all had their memorials upgraded since I have been the member. We understand how important this infrastructure is to our local community because it enables people to engage in special services such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101232"></A>
The other thing I am particularly passionate about, both as the member for Ashgrove and the minister, is of course the environment; it is something I care deeply about. This government has a very strong record of delivering strong environmental regulation and protection in this state. That is why I am very pleased that this year’s budget is providing for our environment, with investment for environmental protection, regulation and recovery throughout Queensland including in my community of Ashgrove.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101233"></A>
Our environment was hit hard by the floods and cyclones, and that is why in this year’s $1.1 billion budget the Department of Environment and Resource Management is focused on bringing our environment back to health. We know that there is still a lot of work to do, and this budget commits $133 million over three years to allow us to enter the next phase of environmental recovery which is focused on sustainability, long-term resilience and rebuilding our assets. This includes $20 million over three years for the restoration of Queensland’s protected areas including repairs to damaged essential assets in national parks, state forests and other protected areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101271"></A>
I want to take this opportunity to thank the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service rangers who have worked around the clock to get as many national parks reopened as possible so that people can come back to our national parks and see them. To this end, I am also pleased to say that in the state budget a further $10.5 million has been allocated over four years for rangers to assist in managing our growing national park estate. We are currently in the process of employing an extra 50 rangers which will take our total ranks to more than 800 for the very first time. We are also spending almost $19 million on infrastructure and facilities in our national parks and across the Department of Environment and Resource Management to ensure that our parks remain great places for people to come to see from right around the world, like we did this morning at D’Aguilar National Park. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1101275"></A>
The reality is protecting our environment is everyone’s responsibility and each Queenslander can play an important role, whether they live on the Gold Coast, in Mount Isa, on the cape or in my electorate of Ashgrove. That is why in this year’s budget we are providing for the first time $3.9 million for new community based projects to support our government’s soon-to-be-released Biodiversity Strategy. This funding will help local environmental groups--those that do much of the work in our communities every day of the year cleaning up our waterways, replanting trees and also of course doing clean-up events. Groups like Save our Waterways Now in my electorate are making a real difference in protecting our local environment. These groups deserve our support and I have lobbied hard to get state government funding to help them continue to provide this important community support and support for our environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101282"></A>
But it is just not community groups that are making a difference; individuals can help in combating climate change and the effects that climate change has on our biodiversity, and this budget gives a big helping hand to do so with a major extension of the hugely popular ClimateSmart Home Service. In this year’s budget we will spend $34.5 million to extend this service to a total $60 million up to the end of 2012. This new service will provide more energy-saving value, with households able to save up to $480 a year on their power bills as well as reducing their carbon emissions by up to 2,500 tonnes. More than 270,000 Queenslanders have already signed up to the existing service to save money and to cut their carbon footprint. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101284"></A>
In my electorate almost one in three households have already signed up to the service and I am very pleased that now even more people in my local community can reap the energy and money saving benefits under the new and extended ClimateSmart Home Service, particularly with the stand-by power eliminator. Not only is this a great way for all of us to help combat climate change by reducing our energy and water usage but is also a very important measure to help Queenslanders who are doing it tough.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101287"></A>
Like all budgets, this is a budget about choices and everything I have just listed in my speech is absolutely funded by the state government--that is, it is costed and budgeted for. We know that in order to deliver key services like the upgrade to Samford Road and Wardell Street we need to have a plan and we need to cost that, and we have had to make the tough choices to enable this to occur. But what we will never do is promise things that we cannot deliver. Unfortunately, what we have seen throughout this week is an opposition that has no plan for the future, an opposition that has made promises that are totally unfunded and refused to be honest with the people of Ashgrove and refused to be honest with the people of Queensland about how it would pay for any of the things that it has promised. Queenslanders and the people of Ashgrove deserve better, and I am in a unique position to ensure that we do just that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101290"></A>
We deserve a Leader of the Opposition who will come clean with the people of Queensland and come clean with the people of Ashgrove about what his intentions are. What we saw was a man who walked away from his position as the Lord Mayor of Brisbane because he said he had a plan. Well, it has been three months, a whole budget week of debate and I have not seen one skerrick of a plan. In actual fact, all we have seen is someone who is ducking and weaving on saying how he will fund any of the empty promises that he has made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101292"></A>
I will continue to represent the people of Ashgrove to the best of my ability because I am passionate about my community. This is an area where I grew up, where I live and where I am raising my family. We deserve to have a person in this House who has the community’s best interests at heart, and that is absolutely why I come to parliament every day--that is, to speak on their behalf, to stand up for them and to deliver key projects like the projects we have seen in this state budget, including the major upgrade of the Samford-Wardell Street intersection and major resurfacing of Wardell Street. We are delivering on the investment we have made in our schools through our record budget in education, something that this side of the House has a very proud record of. It is an absolute privilege and honour to represent the people of Ashgrove and I am delighted by the amount of funding that we have been able to secure in this budget to build a better lifestyle for my community. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CW PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_180510" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mulgrave--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services, Mental Health and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (6.04 pm): Queensland is on the launch pad of a major economic recovery after being knocked around by the global financial crisis and an unprecedented period of natural disasters. We are ready to become the engine room of the Australian economy once again, with expected growth of five per cent next year and an enormous opportunity for jobs growth. This is great news but, more than that, I am pleased that the 2011-12 state budget has been able to deliver for the people who live, work and go to school in my electorate of Mulgrave. Yes, it is a tough budget for tough times, but it is also a budget with heart. At its core it is about our plans to rebuild Queensland while at the same time helping out families. It locks in the spending that will build back our communities better than ever. I quote--</A></Hansard-Body>

Every little bit helps.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101303"></A>
That was the quote in the <Hansard-Italic>
Cairns Post</Hansard-Italic>
 in response to one of the key measures in this year’s state budget from Claire Dauncey, who lives in Bentley Park in my electorate of Mulgrave. She was referring to the abolition of the community ambulance cover levy--the one that has appeared on people’s power bills since 2003. Mother-of-three Ms Dauncey went on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101306"></A>
It’s a saving that I think everyone would welcome, as long as it doesn’t mean money is taken away from the ambulance.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1101307"></A>
The good news is that the ambulance will still show up but the bill will not. The $140 million announcement means a saving of $113 on the electricity bills of 1.4 million Queensland families and small businesses. This is a permanent change that will still see the Ambulance Service remain free for all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101309"></A>
The popular ClimateSmart program will also be extended for another two years, meaning potential savings of $480 on household electricity bills. The Daunceys from Bentley Park bought their home three years ago--their first--and said schemes like the first home buyers grant made it a lot easier to buy a home. The measures announced by the Treasurer are aimed at families just like the Daunceys. We know that working families are grappling with cost-of-living issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101310"></A>
There are also some great incentives for families to attain the great Australian dream of owning their own home. For first home buyers, there is zero stamp duty for homes under $500,000 and there is the Queensland Building Boost that offers a $10,000 grant for a new home contracted between 1 August 2011 and 31 January 2012. First homeowners can now receive up to $17,000. For families who already own a home but who want or need to trade-up--perhaps because of a growing family--this could be the clincher to allow that to happen. This is not only designed to help Queenslanders into new homes but is deliberately designed to be a massive stimulus package for building new homes, kick-starting the housing market and generating jobs and construction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101315"></A>
Far North Queenslanders already know we live in the best part of the state, but it is no secret that our region has been experiencing growing pains for some time, dealing with higher than average unemployment and a need to diversify our local economy. With continued careful planning, I think we are ready to grow into what we have always known was our destiny--to be Queensland’s most liveable region. In order for that to happen, as a region we need to take advantage of this opportunity. We need to put out the welcome mat for those considering the move from down south. We need people to know that we are a great destination for fly-in, fly-out workers to base themselves and their families. We need to have a very steady stream of population drift to the far north to assure our future. Above all, we need not be scared of growth because it will be the thing that will ultimately make our piece of paradise that much better.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101316"></A>
Education and vital social services underpin this budget. In the next four years we are going to see the biggest change to our education system since the introduction of prep. There is $328 million over four years for state schools for building works to move year 7 to secondary school in 2015, which means a better education system for our children. In Mulgrave this budget ensures $2.3 million for the Cairns Early Years Centre at Bentley Park College to give local children a flying start to their education and families more support. It also locks in $1.11 million towards the kindy at White Rock State School which is being fast-tracked to be open by 2012 and to open up opportunities sooner for young children in our local area. There is also an extensive maintenance program worth around $43,000--important funding that will help pave the way for local year 7 students to make the move to high school. I seek leave of the House to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

This budget puts first and foremost the State Government’s plans to rebuild our state as part of Operation Queenslander.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101322"></A>
This budget has seen $151.3 million go to local governments for recovery and reconstruction projects, in partnership with the Australian Government. This includes $15 million to assist the Cassowary Coast Regional Council restore vital infrastructure, vegetation and beaches. It also included $14.1 million of $20 million for industry clean-up and building industry resilience following Cyclone Yasi.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101323"></A>
And whilst not part of this budget, the recent $390,000 upgrade of the Innisfail airport means that aircraft the size of Hercules will be able to land there in emergencies to bring in vital supplies. This upgrade should be completed by the end of this month.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101324"></A>
We are enormously grateful for the kindness and generosity of the United Arab Emirates for their gift of $30 million which, along with $30 million from Queensland Government will over two years see the construction of at least ten category-5 rated cyclone shelters in North and Far North Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101325"></A>
Like many others, as someone who has grown up with the yearly threat of cyclones, I know that our local community has warmly received this news.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101326"></A>
I’ve put forward a case for an additional shelter for Innisfail, as the major population centre in the Cassowary Coast, along with Tully. I also highlighted the need for a shelter for the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah, which is coastally exposed and has limited transport options.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101327"></A>
I continue to lobby strongly, that the proposed Cairns Regional Council’s Edmonton Leisure Centre at Walker Road could be bolstered and made bigger and better if it were to be selected as the site for one of the 10 shelters.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101328"></A>
The southern corridor of Cairns is the known population growth area for the Far North. There is a recognised need for an indoor multipurpose facility for the southern corridor, as well as a PCYC, to help--in particular young people under the age of 18 who make up around one third of the population in this area--to lead active and healthy lives.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101329"></A>
One of my key priorities that I took to the last election was to work with Cairns Regional Council to push for such a facility to serve the needs of local people both now and for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101330"></A>
To secure this facility at Edmonton would be a real win for our local community--not only as a place of safety during a cyclonic event--but also for sport and recreation in the southern suburbs of Cairns.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101331"></A>
This would complement the work of the Southern Corridor Sport and Recreation Taskforce that I established last year, and has already paid dividends for the local sporting community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101332"></A>
Working with Minister Kate Jones, I recently secured a section of state-owned land, worth potentially more than $2.145 million if sold on the open market, to be dedicated as reserve and set aside as the final piece of Cairns Regional Council’s master plan for the Alley Park Sporting Precinct. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101333"></A>
This was a great example of state and local government working together--that was the whole point of the Taskforce, which will continue to work on other issues, including the future use of land adjacent to Petersen Park at Edmonton.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101334"></A>
Like the land at Gordonvale, this land should be converted for sport and recreation use. This would of course not only see Edmonton Storm Junior Rugby League Club to expand, but would also allow the senior club to actually play and train in Edmonton, instead of Cairns where they currently hold home games which affects the clubs revenue base. There would also be potential benefits for a range of other sporting codes and recreational activities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101335"></A>
I’d also like to talk about a few other issues.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101336"></A>
We’re getting on with the job of the $150 million upgrade in the southern corridor, and this is what people I speak to are crying out for. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101337"></A>
$41.04 million in federal funding is set aside in this budget to allow us to start construction between Sheehy Road at White Rock and Ray Jones Drive. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101338"></A>
And things are happening. The tender process is nearing completion with the winning consortium to be announced in September. Relocation of the Department’s RoadTek depot already underway. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101339"></A>
Commuters in the southern corridor are one step closer to reduced congestion with construction expected to start onsite prior to Christmas for a completion date in 2013.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101340"></A>
$1.52 million to complete the replacement of the Gordonvale ambulance station at a total cost of $2.34 million</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1101341"></A>
Labor went to the last election with a policy to redevelop the existing Cairns Base Hospital site and to acquire land for a health facility in the southern suburbs of Cairns. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101342"></A>
I’m proud to say this is exactly what is being delivered.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101343"></A>
The budget sees the next $50 million towards the $446.3 million ongoing redevelopment of the Cairns Base Hospital, due to open in 2014. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101344"></A>
The decision was made that a redeveloped Cairns Base Hospital will remain the primary hospital for Cairns and Far North Queensland for several years to come but we have also planned beyond the immediate horizon by purchasing land at Edmonton for future health services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101345"></A>
With the ongoing Cairns Base Hospital redevelopment we will have the capacity to perform procedures right here in the Far North, like radiation oncology services, which will mean around 340 patients per year will no longer have to travel to Townsville or Brisbane for treatment. It is because we rebuilt on the existing site that we have an expanded Emergency Department to treat more people and sooner.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101346"></A>
These new and expanded services wouldn’t have been available in this timeframe if we had started again on a greenfield site. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101347"></A>
I’m very proud to have been able to secure land at a second facility in the future at Edmonton is not about splitting services we already have in Cairns. Future services should complement those in Cairns, not compete with them.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101348"></A>
But we know the population in the southern suburbs will fill in over the next 15-20 years. That’s why I advocated so strongly for a site to be confirmed--so it could be safeguarded--and it is only because of good planning that we can even consider having that discussion.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101349"></A>
Expert health planners say we don’t need a second hospital until after 2020, but I am determined to see something sooner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101350"></A>
The Premier ordered a review of the Health Service Plan for the Cairns region. This is the opportunity to give certainty about what is needed on that site and when. Initially, I’d like to see a health facility that provided important primary health care, community and out of hospital services, like physio appointments and ante-natal checks. And in the future, this health precinct would grow to a second supporting hospital for the region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101351"></A>
I want to take this opportunity to again put on the record that I am committed to delivering the best long term, sustainable health outcome--not only my local community, but for our region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101352"></A>
I was humbled to be elevated to Cabinet in February of this year and was tasked as Minister for Disability Services, Mental Health and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101353"></A>
The budget for my portfolio is a record investment of $1.855 billion to help people doing it tough. This investment is providing: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101354"></A>
more services and support for people with a disability</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101355"></A>
$70.3 million for community mental health </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101356"></A>
Funds to help young people with a disability--to give them the support they need so that they don’t end up in residential aged care, and to create more support options to give young people with a disability the life skills and links they’ll need once they leave school</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101357"></A>
Half a billion dollars to help our home and community care workers to help others</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101358"></A>
And $80 million for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services--to roll out more housing, create jobs and job opportunities and to deliver better health and education outcomes--importantly, to help close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101359"></A>
There’s a lot more work to be done and we remain determined, as a government, to deliver the best outcomes for people with a disability in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101360"></A>
As Disability Services Minister, locally I’m delighted there is a significant investment in disability services and support for carers and their families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101361"></A>
$606,000 for Autism Queensland to help children with autism and their families to make the transition to school a little easier.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101362"></A>
More than $1.5 million for St John’s Community Care to help reduce the number of younger people with a disability living in residential aged care facilities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101363"></A>
Organisations like the Endeavour Foundation and Innisfail District Flexi Respite will also be able to continue their good work supporting families and people with a disability in the region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101364"></A>
We’ll have an extra five Local Area Coordinators in Queensland, including one for the Cassowary Coast.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101365"></A>
Our community mental health package of included $11.2 million over three years to help restore mental health and well-being to Queenslanders, particularly those in our flood-affected regions and the cyclone-damaged Far North.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101366"></A>
It also set aside $300,000 for the Men’s Shed initiative. Men’s Sheds have been a turning point for a lot of men, particularly men with mental health issues, alcohol dependency and low self esteem. The sheds are a place for men to get together in their own space, give each other support and share their stories. For some, it’s a meeting place other than their local pub. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101367"></A>
I’m keen to see more Men’s Shed’s in the Far North, and I’ll work with community partners to try and make this a reality.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101368"></A>
Mr Speaker, as I said earlier, this is a tough budget for tough times. It’s a budget that will have a direct and positive impact on people’s lives. That’s what this budget is all about. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_180942" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Ipswich West--ALP) (6.09 pm): I rise tonight to provide my support for the fourth Bligh-Fraser budget and I will ensure that I keep my comments brief and to the point. As everyone in the world knows, earlier this year nearly every community and economy across the state was hit hard by a spate of freak natural disasters and, of course, those natural disasters were also preceded by continual drenching wet weather over much of the south-east corner in particular. With those natural disasters coming hot on the heals of the global financial crisis, I think that most of us thought that the Queensland economy was about to explode into the stratosphere before this combination of weather events. As a result, the state and the majority of Queenslanders themselves, rather than enjoy the expected benefits, now had to refocus their efforts on helping their friends, their neighbours, other family members or, in many cases, even strangers to help them get their lives and livelihoods back to normal. I think that if such freakish weather events were to occur in any other place around the world following hot on the heals of the GFC I am sure that you could probably count out the possibility of the government of the day being in a position to react and reconstruct to the degree we have seen here in Queensland. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101424"></A>
With that in mind, I think it is important to recognise and repeat the comments of the Treasurer when he stated on Tuesday that these events had the effect of smashing the production ability of many of our industries across the state. For example, our traditional strengths of mining, agriculture and tourism all took a major beating. For instance, lost production in the mining industry alone is estimated to total nearly $6 billion in 2010-11, with coal exports to be around 27 million tonnes lower. Agricultural losses were huge and are expected to total around $1.4 billion, with sugar, cotton, bananas and avocados the hardest hit. In addition, the toll for tourism from the natural disasters in terms of lost export revenue is expected to be around $400 million in the short term.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101425"></A>
During the Treasurer’s speech I noted that he also stated that the fiscal cost to Queensland to rebuild our state will be around $6.8 billion. Of course, that cost will be shared by the state and the federal governments, with funds for local councils now totalling $2.75 billion. When we add this figure to the loss in revenue in areas such as coal royalty revenue of around $500 million, stamp duty down by nearly $350 million as well as drops in gambling and land taxes, it is easy to see how these costs have hit the budget bottom line hard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101426"></A>
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have shown my speech to the Speaker as well as sent a copy to Hansard. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101427"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101428"></A>
In fact Mr Speaker, since the disaster declarations began, nearly $90M has been paid out to over 4,200 small businesses and over 5,000 primary producers through grants of up to $25,000 each, and in some cases loans of up to $650,000.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101429"></A>
In addition Mr Speaker, we have reopened 411 schools that were affected by the floods and cyclones, and in less than six months have repaired 6,600 kilometres of roads, the equivalent of a new road from Brisbane to Darwin and back again.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101430"></A>
Mr Speaker, it is expected that in 2010--11 a total of $193M will have been spent on repairing State roads, with a further $93M spent on other damaged infrastructure, like schools and hospitals.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101431"></A>
Further, $465M is expected to be allocated to local governments across Queensland in 2010--11, with $419M provided to date in advance payments to 56 councils.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101432"></A>
However Mr Speaker there is still a monumental task ahead of us with some $2.8B worth of projects and initiatives planned for the 2011-12 year, and a further $2B in 2012-13.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101433"></A>
What this means Mr Speaker is that our road network, our states lifeblood, will receive the majority of the reconstruction budget, amounting to around 72%, and this will ensure that we build better roads, highways and local lanes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101434"></A>
And in addition Mr Speaker, this will mean that over the next year or two, damaged roads right across the state will be a hive of activity, with key regional routes a particular focus of the reconstruction. And Mr Speaker I think it’s also worthwhile noting that around 73%, that’s right, three quarters of this expenditure will in fact be spent in the regions, and only 28% spent in south east Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101435"></A>
Mr Speaker before I move onto budget issues directly associated with Ipswich West I would like to take a few moments to comment on the announcement about the abolition of the Ambulance levy, which will result in savings of around $113 per year per household.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101436"></A>
Mr Speaker as you know more than 1.4 million Queensland households and small businesses will benefit from the abolition of the levy, but at the same time Queenslanders would continue to receive free ambulance services at home, anywhere in their state, or for that matter, any where in Australia.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101437"></A>
It was considered that the option of removing the ambulance levy represented the best and most direct way of lessening the burden on families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101438"></A>
In addition to the $113 saving the government has also announced that it will extend its $60M ClimateSmart Home service, including the new ‘standby power eliminator’ which has the ability to also further reduce the average homes power bill by $190.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101439"></A>
Mr Speaker when you add these saving to the other concessions and savings available to Queenslanders like the increase to the electricity rebate of 6.6%, taking it to $230 for pensioners and seniors, the increase to council rebates by $20, taking it to $200, and the corresponding increase to the Pensioner Water Subsidy by another $20 to $120, it’s easy to see that this government is doing all it can to relieve daily living pressures for Queensland families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101440"></A>
Mr Speaker, I would now like to provide the House with some advice on budget initiatives in my electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101441"></A>
Mr Speaker I’m happy to announce that this year’s State Budget will deliver improved facilities at train stations and schools, across the Ipswich West electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101442"></A>
Specifically Mr Speaker the Rosewood Railway Station will receive $450,000 so it can increase commuter parking. This is necessary because more and more locals are using our train network, and we want to make sure there’re enough parks to encourage more people to leave the car at home and catch the train to work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101443"></A>
The government is also spending $500,000 for additional accommodation at Lowood State High School, where we will be rebuilding the administration area which was recently damaged by fire, and in addition, just down the road, we will see $200,000 put towards planning for classroom/administration enhancements at the growing Fernvale State School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101444"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Budget also features funding for roads, infrastructure, outdoor recreation and emergency services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101445"></A>
For instance the government is spending $36.3 million on improving the Brisbane Valley Highway and Warrego Highway (Ipswich--Toowoomba) intersection, $16.3 million will go towards buying and developing land for the Aerospace Industry Park at Amberley, $9 million has been allocated for the construction of a new sealed two-lane standard on a section of Haigslea-Amberley Road, Ipswich, and the budget has committed $2.3 million towards the development, promotion, marketing and operational coordination of the Regional Recreation Trails--which of course include the Brisbane Valley Rail Trail and the Boonah to Ipswich Trail. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101446"></A>
However Mr Speaker one of the highlights that I am most happy to see is the allocation of $450,000 to be used to construct a new permanently staffed 24/7 urban fire and rescue station at Brassall, which of course is further evidence of the Queensland Government delivering on its priorities for Ipswich West.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101447"></A>
Other funding allocated to the Ipswich West electorate in the budget includes:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101453"></A>
$396,189 to Ipswich Independent Youth Service Inc to provide counselling and support for young people at risk of homelessness and to provide supported crisis-short-term accommodation for young people in the Ipswich area who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, at a total cost of $1.189 million</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_181216" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Bundaberg--LNP) (6.11 pm): Like many Queenslanders, I am very concerned about the direction, lack of planning and waste that has led to this enormous and unnecessary debt that this Labor government has created. I am concerned about the government’s lack of vision and the burden that it has incurred for future generations of Queenslanders. I am concerned that the cost of living is out of control. I am concerned that our debt continues to spiral. I am concerned that, after all the promises and half-truths by this Labor government before the global financial crisis and before our natural disasters, this Labor government has squandered $17 billion of Queenslanders’ hard-earned money and, particularly, has sold off Queensland’s assets such as rail, forestry, ports and toll roads. That mismanagement has seen Queensland still being the only state without a AAA credit rating and a rising $85 billion debt. </A></Hansard-Body>

Before this Labor Treasurer starts saying things like pulling rabbits out of his hat, this Labor government should first address the elephant in the room, which is the carbon tax that will detrimentally affect Queensland’s mining and resource sector. The carbon tax issue needs to be addressed for businesses to have confidence and a clear direction when making investment decisions. We have just been presented with a budget that is almost self-reliant on the mining and LNG industries. But there is not one mention in the budget of a carbon tax, which, by all predictions, will be delivered in this coming financial year. There is not one contingency plan or comment made to alleviate the fears of many Queenslanders and stakeholders for this vitally important industry. There is not one admission that Queensland competes in an international investment market with other LNG, coal seam gas and coal projects and that if this carbon tax indecision is not addressed in a timely manner it would threaten our ability to secure their long-term tenure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101480"></A>
Transparency and accountability are once again words that are manifested by this Labor government only so that it can continue its fairytale of broken promises and not facing up to reality. This state Labor government has run almost unbroken for 20 years with Goss, Beattie and now Bligh and at its inception its foundations were built on the mantra of those two important words. Over the past 20 years the meaning of those two important words has faded and this government fails to have the same motivation due to a heavily laden Labor bureaucracy and the inevitable complacency that comes with being a long-term Labor government. I refer to fairytale promises such as ‘We will not get rid of the fuel subsidy,’ ‘We will not put up the price of electricity’ and ‘We will not sell the assets.’ All of those false promises, coupled with the billion dollar waste of the Health payroll, the water grid, the Tugun desalination plant, the Traveston Dam and the AIGP, overtly manifest a dysfunctional government. The future financial realities of this great state are unable to be addressed by this long-term and complacent Labor government, which has allowed the wheels of government to become clogged by red tape and bureaucracy. It is a government that has also allowed political interference and lobby groups to overturn policy direction and procedures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101482"></A>
The reality of this budget is that it omits the impact of a high Australian dollar and the highly competitive worldwide competition for mining projects and the reality that our state’s future and the lifestyle that we would like to have are dependent on this state government standing up for Queenslanders and saying no to this Gillard carbon tax. For the current Treasurer’s own Queensland state budget to succeed, we must have a strong mining sector and we must address the real concerns of a Gillard-Bligh carbon tax. There is concern as the chief of Australia’s second largest metallurgical coal exporter, Anglo American Coal, warns that a carbon tax will put at risk 3,000 regional jobs in Queensland and New South Wales and put at risk $2 billion in planned investment. There is concern when the Minerals Council of Australia says that a carbon tax could cost the industry $30 billion in 2020 and threaten an investment pipeline of $104 billion. In relation to sovereign risk, there is concern that a complacent Labor government has allowed this state and its mining industry to slip below that of many Third World countries. </Hansard-Body>

Since 1997, the Fraser Institute has conducted an annual survey of metal, mining and exploration companies to assess how mineral endowments and public policy factors such as taxation and regulation affect exploration investment. The survey results represent the opinions of executives and exploration managers in mining and mining consulting companies operating around the world. The survey includes data on 79 jurisdictions in every continent except Antarctica, and that includes Canada, Australia and the United States. This survey is a report card to governments on the attractiveness of their mining policies. The survey states--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1101488"></A>
While geologic and economic evaluations are always requirements for exploration, in today’s globally competitive economy where mining companies may be examining properties located on different continents, a region’s policy climate has taken on increased importance in attracting and winning investment. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101489"></A>
The policy potential index serves as a report card to governments on how attractive their policies are from the point of view of an exploration manager. The policy potential index is a composite index that measures the effects on exploration of government policies, including uncertainty concerning administration, interpretation and enforcement of existing regulations, environmental regulations, regulatory duplication and inconsistencies, taxations, uncertainties concerning native land claims and protected areas. It also goes into infrastructure, socioeconomic agreements, political stability, labour issues, geological databases and security and reliability of the legal system--legal processes that are fair, transparent, non-corrupt, timely and effectively administered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101539"></A>
I will table a copy of the report shortly, but when we look at that policy potential index, it clearly shows that from 2006 to 2007 we were ranked eighth in the world. We were in the top 10 in relation to sovereign risk in relation to the mining industry. In 2010-11 we have slipped to No. 38 in the world. We are not just 38 in the world; we have slipped to being the most poorly effective state within Australia. Our rating of 38 is behind the likes of Tasmania on 28, Victoria on 31, Western Australia on 17, South Australia on 11, the Northern Territory on 27 and New South Wales on 20. In less than four years this state Labor government has increased the sovereign risk of international companies dealing with Australia in relation to mining and resources. I table that first report. It clearly shows the report card for Queensland in relation to its competitive edge and the loss of that competitive edge.</Hansard-Body>

I will name some of the countries that we fall behind in the policy potential index. I have heard other members in this House say that one would think we were a Third World country.

Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the member for Chatsworth. The government that the member for Chatsworth represents has taken Queensland investment from the top 10 to No. 38 in the world. That means that international investment would rather concentrate on the likes of Botswana than it would Queensland--this great state that people love to live in and enjoy. It is an absolute disgrace for the member for Chatsworth to come in here and pretend to put his hand on his heart and bleat a whole heap of rubbish in relation to his lack of knowledge on how the international sector views our reputation on a world scale. In the mining and resources industry, our reputation is important to ensure that we have the investment here in Queensland because we want the lifestyle. The member for Chatsworth might care to have a look at the report that I have tabled. </Hansard-Body>

The budget relies heavily on the mining and resources sector, yet it does not address the real need for skilled workers and the costs associated with educational courses or additional facilities. Nor does this budget take into account contingency plans for the possible future costs of introducing migrant workers into Queensland and accommodating their social, recreational and cultural diversities. </Hansard-Body>

This state government has again not learned from recent disasters that they are unpredictable and has based this budget’s success on fully operating mines. This state government has not taken into account that the state has many mines still affected by floodwaters and the real possibility of further rains in the wet season. A recent media statement from the Queensland Resources Council states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101548"></A>
The credibility of the coal royalties estimates in next week’s state Budget will rest on the Queensland Government’s resolve to do more to allow the removal of flood waters from Queensland coal mines, according to the state peak’s minerals and energy industry group.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101549"></A>
Queensland Resources Council (QRC) Chief Executive Michael Roche said he was concerned that too many people in the Queensland Government continued to underestimate the true extent of the last wet season’s impact on the coal sector and remain unwilling to take more decisive action. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1101553"></A>
Mr Roche said that before the wet season crisis, the Queensland coal industry was set to export a record 200 million tonnes or more in 2010-11, but now looks likely to fall around 40 million tonnes short of that figure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The lack of future planning, proper management and financial management by this state Labor government continues to impact negatively on the aspirations of all Queenslanders and, in particular, the mining and resource sector. This state budget shows Labor’s mismanagement with an explosion of debt, no real relief for households and nothing for the future. Queenslanders are hammered with stamp duty doubling, while electricity, registration and water price increases will more than wipe out any gains from the removal of the ambulance levy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101558"></A>
After 20 long years, Labor is still promising that good times are around the corner. It is still trying to blame everyone else for its failings. On a regular basis people come into my office needing help as they struggle with the ever-escalating cost of bills and everyday essentials. Constant hikes in electricity, petrol, groceries, rates, water and other charges are hurting people in Bundaberg and the rest of Queensland. It really should not be the case when one considers this state’s natural resources and beauty. Queensland should be enjoying the benefits of an economic boom, yet Queensland families and pensioners are struggling to pay the next bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101559"></A>
Unfortunately 20 years of Labor government has seen money raised from Queensland resources and assets being squandered. In times of economic prosperity the Bligh Labor government debt has blown out to an estimated $84.9 billion in 2014-15. This results in Queenslanders paying $595,000 in interest per hour. That is not $590,000 a week or $590,000 a day; that is $595,000 an hour in interest alone due to this Labor government’s mismanagement of the hard-earned tax dollars of all Queenslanders. How many extra nurses, teachers, police, emergency services workers, schools, hospitals and roads would that pay for? Just think for a moment of that money being put towards easing the financial burden and assisting families, seniors, pensioners and those with disabilities with the cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101560"></A>
Yes, the roof is not falling in on Queensland, but how much better could it have been if we did not go bust in a boom long before the global financial crisis and long before our natural disasters? If this Bligh Labor government had not wasted billions of taxpayers’ dollars and planned for the economic and social future of this great state instead of the short-term political future of the Labor Party, how much better a position would Queenslanders be in right now? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101561"></A>
This massive debt and its interest bill have devastating consequences on families and pensioners, whom the Bligh Labor government continues to use as a revenue resource to cover up its own incompetence. In a five-year period, families and pensioners have copped a 63 per cent increase in electricity bills, a 36 per cent increase in water bills, a 23 per cent increase in food costs, a 25 per cent increase in the cost of car registration, the removal of the fuel subsidy and the doubling of the cost of five-year driver’s licences. Those spikes in prices are nothing more than a cash grab by a desperate Bligh Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101562"></A>
For 20 years, Queenslanders have heard the Goss, Beattie and Bligh Labor governments peddle excuse after excuse as to why debt keeps blowing out. For 20 years, we have heard the Goss, Beattie and Bligh Labor governments promise that good times are around the corner, but no amount of feeble excuses and tongue-in-cheek promises can hide that this is not a can-do government. It cannot manage the economy, it cannot invest in vital infrastructure, it cannot provide basic health and education services and it cannot control the cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101563"></A>
Queensland families and pensioners deserve much better. They deserve a can-do government that will manage the economy and do everything in its power to reduce the cost-of-living burden. The LNP is committed to ensuring our state’s resources and incomes are not wasted. The LNP is committed to making sure Queenslanders can enjoy the boom instead of struggle to pay the bills. This Bligh Labor government is more concerned with politics than the people of Queensland. It is only a can-do LNP government that will work for the people of Queensland, save money and deliver more by getting action on the basics and cutting waste.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_193050" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Southern Downs--LNP) (7.30 pm): Before turning to some issues specific to the electorate of Southern Downs, I will make some general comments on this year’s state budget. Of course, as the Treasurer would understand, they are not going to be too flattering. This budget is very predictable in its sameness; it is very much like the budgets that have been delivered by this Treasurer in the past four financial years. Each and every year, on behalf of the government, this Treasurer comes into the House and tells us that we can expect halcyon times to be just around the corner, that golden fields and rolling green plains are ahead of us, that we will have blue skies and warm temperatures, that it is going to be a wonderful place for us all and that we are going to have a land of milk and honey. He says, ‘Just trust us long enough and that land of milk and honey is just around the corner. It is not far away. But if we don’t get it right this year, certainly give us another go because we are going to get it right the next year. Even if we do not get it right the next year, we will recycle the predictable rhetoric and all of our verbose cliches to make sure it sounds exactly the same. We will manipulate the rubbery figures.’ And the budget is full of predictable rubbery figures which are going to be wrong--because they always are. ‘We will tell people that it will be a little bit better down the track because, lo and behold, we did not expect the GFC to be as bad as it was and we had a summer of natural disasters and something else will go wrong next year.’ </A></Hansard-Body>

As we all know, in times past in Queensland we have had quite serious natural disasters, such as the 1974 floods, but we did not lose the state’s AAA credit rating. We did not go broke in that period. The government was able to build major infrastructure. The government was able to rebuild. The government was able to flood mitigate at that time without blaming everybody else. It was able to do that while making sure that it had some money in the bank and was in a stronger financial position for the future. But not this government. It went into this summer of natural disasters without any money in the bank, without any intention of insurance, without any ability to insure itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107585"></A>
Some months ago, a very instructive debate was going at full speed about whether Queensland should have had flood insurance and whether the government should have gone to the market more openly and pursued flood insurance. The Treasurer said, ‘We had a bit of a sniff around and decided it wasn’t really worth it. But it doesn’t matter, because at the end of the day we knew the Commonwealth government was going to pay for three-quarters of the damage.’ That is the way that the Labor Party in Queensland has always operated: it is always someone’s else’s fault and someone else’s responsibility. They say, ‘We don’t have to look after ourselves, because someone else will look after us.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107586"></A>
Let us look at the rubbery figures in this state budget. The government has some sort of dotted line that seems to indicate and predict how much worse the underlying budget would have been if we had not sold $17 billion worth of Queensland assets. Expenditure over income would have been at 150 per cent rather than 120 per cent. I take this House back to February 2008, when Standard &amp; Poor’s appeared before the Senate Economics Committee. When asked what the situation was looking like for a number of Australian states regarding their credit rating, they said that unless states like Queensland got their excess of expenditure over income under control they would be at severe risk of losing their AAA credit rating. That was before the first inklings of the global financial crisis, which happened in the latter stages of 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107587"></A>
Things were going very well, but this government was on course to lose our AAA credit rating before the global financial crisis. Now it has no plan whatsoever to put in place a strategy to get that AAA credit rating back. We know that the loss of the AAA credit rating is adding to the cost of our borrowings in this state. Because Queensland is a higher risk, the additional cost of funds is costing doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers, firefighters, schools, kilometres of road, family services officers, child protection officers and so on. Each year it costs this state millions of dollars more to fund the blowing-out, exponential debt because of the bad financial management of this state Labor government. Not even the Keneally government, in its worst financial incompetence, went as broke as this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107589"></A>
Again we have these rubbery figures that predict we are going to have five per cent or 5.5 per cent economic growth next year. They have not accounted for the carbon tax, because they say they cannot talk about hypotheticals. The reality is that it does not suit them to talk about the ‘hypothetical’ carbon tax, which will drag down the Queensland economy because the Queensland economy has a high reliance on the resources sector. The carbon tax is going to have a major impact on the resources sector and investment in Queensland. It is going to have an impact on transportation. It is already having an impact on the confidence of the people in Queensland and Australia who are considering investing, whether it is in commercial or industrial opportunities or even investing domestically. People are concerned about it. Members can go around their own electorates and hear what the people are saying. There is no confidence because of the potential impact of a carbon tax and the fact that this government is not even factoring it into its economic figures and planning for the future. That is an absolute dereliction, because unless you are prepared to model the issues that are likely to be problems down the track you have absolutely no hope whatsoever of being able to competently and properly deal with the task at hand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107590"></A>
Why should we believe that the figures that have been presented by the master of all cliches, the Treasurer, are not rubbery? Why should we believe that these are the right figures? You cannot trust the Labor Party. This is the same Treasurer who, prior to the last state election, said, ‘Things are okay. We don’t need to introduce a fuel tax in Queensland of 9.2c a litre by abolishing the fuel subsidy scheme. We don’t have any plans to do that. We don’t have any plans for the mass privatisation of asset sales in Queensland. We don’t need to do that. We don’t have any plans for that.’ Lo and behold, at some time between when the Treasurer turned off the lights on the Friday before the election on Saturday and when he walked back into the office on Monday after being re-elected, guess what? Some bugger got in and emptied out the safe! What did they have to do then? They had to sell everything off, because on the Friday before the election they did not know it was going to be that bad, but something changed over the weekend. I suspect that they did know but they were hiding it from the people of Queensland. You cannot trust the Labor Party. They do this all the time. They always run the economy into the ground. They run the Queensland economy into the ground. However, there is no excuse for going broke in a boom. There is no excuse whatsoever. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107619"></A>
This is a government that still does not understand the implications of its own budgetary initiatives. It went out there the other day and sung its own praises about how this additional $10,000 was going to be an amazing boon for first home buyers in Queensland who sign up in the six months from August this year. It was going to be an extraordinary boon. What it did not tell us so much about was the negative impact on investment, on the real estate market and on the development industry in Queensland that would result from the extraordinary increase in stamp duty for those people who are not first homeowners but who are actually buying a subsequent or brand-new place of residence. People used to be able to gain a significant stamp duty tax advantage when they bought a principal place of residence. That is not available to them anymore. We saw the commentary in the last day or so in the electorate of Ashgrove. We saw people who were previously predisposed towards voting for the Labor Party but who are actually saying now that they do not believe that they can vote for it. They are really worried because they know this will impact upon their ability to upgrade their home. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107624"></A>
These people are not wealthy landlords. These people are not people who are just living off the fat of the land. We are talking here about Queensland mums and dads with young families who may have actually outgrown their place of residence. They may now have three children instead of two and so they need to move to a new place. Because of the cost of purchasing in a place such as Ashgrove, where the median house price is $670,000, they are then forced to upgrade knowing full well that they will have to pay an extra $10,000 in stamp duty. If the purchase price is a little bit more than that, they will be paying much more in stamp duty. Where is the fairness in that? Where is the fairness in charging those people this additional amount of money? Where is the fairness in punishing them? These are people who are battling just to get ahead. These people are not real estate barons; they are people who have previously purchased their first home and now wish to upgrade their principal place of residence. It is fundamentally unfair, and the Treasurer did not talk about the implication of that in his cliche riddled speech last Tuesday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107625"></A>
The Treasurer also did not tell us that he was not even capable of coming up with a brand new idea of his own. He actually stole this idea--in effect, a $17,000 first home owner’s grant--out of the moribund administration of the Northern Territory Labor government, which is also on its way out. He could not even come up with his own ideas with regard to this. Is that any surprise, coming from a government that, in the last couple of weeks, has gone on to steal more and more of the LNP’s announcements when it comes to things such as establishing a crime squad on the Gold Coast and tagging paedophiles in Queensland with GPS tracking technology? All of those sorts of things were stolen from the LNP. So I suppose there should be no surprise that we have a government which is now going to steal ideas from another Labor government which has also been around too long--the Northern Territory Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107626"></A>
We have only to go to the comments that Neville Wran made in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 in the last couple of weeks that the modern-day Labor Party has lost touch with those people whom it has traditionally represented. He went on to say that people who traditionally came in as Labor Party members are now coming in on the conservative side of parliament. He said that the big problem with the modern Labor Party is that its members include a bunch of people who are selected as candidates from a university or academic cloistered environment or the cloistered environment of a ministerial, MP’s or departmental office and are then thrust straight into parliament without having any understanding of the practical implications of the policies which they are bringing in. I speak for example of the implications of additional stamp duty on the mums and dads out there who are trying to buy their own home or who are trying to run their own businesses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107628"></A>
A classic example of someone who has lived in a cloistered environment and does not understand the implications of his policies from the undemocratic amalgamations down to the stamp duty policies and the way he is running the Queensland economy into the ground is the member for Mount Coot-tha. He is someone who is akin to a modern-day medieval quack who is absolutely addicted to the only solution that he sees to address the problem of the state, which is additional taxation. We know what a medieval quack used to do when somebody presented with a sword wound. They were told, ‘Go away and take a leach.’ Someone who was run over by a Roman chariot would be told to take two leaches. If they were suffering the bubonic plague they were told to go out, have another leach and the hair of a black cat. What we have here is a Treasurer who thinks, ‘Global warming? Let’s have a tax. Global cooling? Let’s have a tax. The economy is going good? Let’s have a tax. The economy is going bad? Let’s have a tax.’ That is what we have from this government. It sees it as a taxation world out there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107629"></A>
When it comes to managing the economy, it is a case of modern medieval quackery, and it does not understand how you grow an economy. You grow an economy by providing incentives and by taking your hands out of the pockets of people as much as they possibly can to give them confidence. Anyone who does not believe that confidence drives the economy should look at what is happening in Canberra at the moment with regard to the multiheaded mutant government of the Greens, Independents and the Labor Party that is running this country into economic oblivion and putting up the cost of living. Look at the what the economic indicators are saying in Queensland when it comes to the way that this state is going. It is falling behind in key indicators in so many areas of economic performance and growth. It is the state that has so much going for it in terms of the resources sector, agriculture and tourism and their really good flow-on affects. So is it any wonder that Neville Wran made those comments that we have a modern-day Labor Party that is so much out of touch with what is going on? They are tax addicts and tax junkies. It is about time they understood the implications of their policy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107630"></A>
I turn now to some issues that relate to my electorate. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Sport, who has been active on the ground around Queensland in recent times addressing some of the issues of clubs that have been seriously affected by the floods in the state of Queensland. That is no different to his recent visit to the electorate of Southern Downs when he showed a significant degree of empathy, support and encouragement to a number of those clubs that have been affected whether it be the tennis club, the Warwick Hockey Club, Cowboys rugby league or a whole range of others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107634"></A>
We must make sure that we go forward in a positive and proactive way from here and that infrastructure is rebuilt to a much higher standard than in the past. If that infrastructure is built, it will stand the test of natural disasters into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107635"></A>
I want to touch on the eight-mile intersection outside of Warwick. There would no surprises that it is eight miles in the old measure north of Warwick. That intersection was rebuilt by an underspend from the former Commonwealth government a number of years ago. It should have been a split grade separation for safety. Only $4.5 million came along. We still have an unsafe intersection. Recently the Minister for Main Roads gave a commitment to me in a letter that he has now asked his department to look at a different option which includes grade separation. I would encourage the minister to keep on that particular track because it is extremely important that we do that for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107636"></A>
Looking at some of the issues that need to be addressed in the electorate of Southern Downs in the future, it is ultimately inevitable that many of our communities, which are large and growing communities--and, indeed, even smaller communities--will have to be bypassed by heavy vehicle or through traffic to ensure the amenity and the lifestyle of those communities but also the economic advantage can be maintained. Travelling through communities can be a great problem for major transport operators as they seek to shift a significant amount of freight. The 4,500 B-doubles a day that travel down James Street in Toowoomba is a classic example of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107637"></A>
I would like to encourage this government at least in terms of planning, to look at the best location for a bypass of Warwick. I understand that it is something that may not happen for the next two to three decades, but the planning, the preplanning and potential land acquisition needs to be done now. I imagine that most of the bypass would, ultimately, be funded by the federal government. However, there is an implication for the Cunningham Highway, which comes in from Goondiwindi to Warwick. That would need to be considered so there would be an area of partnering. I think this issue has dillydallied for years and years. It has been talked about for a long time but we are no further ahead. At least if we can try to identify a route for the bypass we can nail that down for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115394"></A>
Also, I continue to have a major concern about the fact that the Warwick State High School is bursting at the seams. The government does not seem to have a program of ensuring that additional land is acquired for the future educational needs of those students, particularly when year 7 will be integrated into high school in 2015. I take absolutely no solace from the encouraging words of the government when it says, ‘We put some money into budget.’ I go back to when this government talked for five or six years about bringing in prep, yet when preppies were due to start in the February we still had some schools without the appropriate resources. It was the same with the earning and learning agenda which was implemented at the same time when years 11 and 12 came into our schools. This government needs to do something serious about ensuring that the Warwick State High School will be in a position to meet the growth needs of that community into the future, and it better get moving very, very quickly. </Hansard-Body>

I believe that he has managed to achieve a very balanced approach to the budget which, while not pleasing all Queenslanders, is certainly on the right track to achieve the ultimate benefits which our state deserves and each citizen needs to enjoy their own lifestyle. I congratulate him and his staff on bringing down what I believe is a good financial plan which looks to the future. </A></Hansard-Body>

I believe it is a travesty for various members opposite to stand up and rave on about what they were not granted in their own electorates. I realise, as do the members on this side of the House, how hard one has to work to achieve success. Listening to the member for Southern Downs, I thought it was rather cute that he was willing to accuse the Labor Party of having members who came to parliament through ministerial offices when he himself came into the parliament at 21 and has never held a job other than parliamentarian. I think that is just a little bit cute. I have listened with growing dismay to an opposition which has sidelined its parliamentary leader and set its usually low targets. As each opposition speaker sets out to knock Queensland and Queenslanders, we realise that they could not even reach their dismal target. </Hansard-Body>

The Treasurer has to find $6.8 billion in disaster funding and has achieved a deficit of $4.065 billion. I trust the shadow Treasurer has enough fingers to calculate that the only cause of the deficit is natural disasters. The LNP have not outlined how they will stop those in the future. Without the disasters of 2011, the Treasurer would have met the budget rule criticised by the shadow Treasurer in his speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115405"></A>
In fact, I will make a prediction that Campbell and his sycophants in this House have targeted the funding allocated to reconstruction. Remember that he wanted the government to allocate 70 per cent of infrastructure funding to Brisbane. I believe that Queenslanders must start to question this group of misfits from the LNP who have not worked to help their electorate by lobbying the Treasurer but hope that he could wield a magic wand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115406"></A>
It is quite interesting to look at other comments of the shadow Treasurer--or is he the Premier-in-waiting for when Campbell fails to take a seat in this House? Obviously the elected leader of the LNP in this House was sidelined; I do not know whether he was injured or having a day off. Mr Newman would probably understand if I wished him all the worst, with the hope that he is destined to become the Sarah Palin of Queensland politics. The <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 carried a letter today which said it all. He was elected as Lord Mayor, cut and ran after three years when the going got tough and now wants to tell everybody, including all those potentially unqualified leaders of the opposition in here, how he can do a better job than anyone else.</Hansard-Body>

When I was younger I had an interest in ventriloquism. I always understood that the person at the back was the person who made the dummy speak. The dummy is the little manikin in the front. I was amazed yesterday to watch the news on two channels--Channel 10 and Channel 7--and see an interview with the member for Clayfield and the little mannikin. I was intrigued to find that the big ventriloquist at the back could speak and say different things from the little manikin in the front. It was clear that the little manikin objected to being made an irrelevancy and he wanted to say something. </Hansard-Body>

 What a pathetic stage show for the people of Queensland, who still do not know what they would be belted with under an LNP government. The people of the Sunshine Coast already know that the future of their university hospital has been targeted and they should take note of that fact.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115412"></A>
I also hope that the people of Central Queensland pay attention to the words of the shadow Treasurer in relation to the assumed LNP support for a stadium in Rockhampton if the CQ NRL bid is successful. Look on page 1,959 of yesterday’s <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
, where he claims that money spent on stadiums is wasted. He used the words ‘cheap political promises’. </Hansard-Body>

 I take that interjection of the member for Southport. I am sure the bid team will be very happy to find out that they have been conned. In taking the interjection of the member for Southport, I note that the member for Gaven seemed to have a bit of an aversion to stadiums this afternoon, even though the government now operates two on the Gold Coast. What sort of attraction is that to major international events? </Hansard-Body>

Motor vehicle owners, for whom the LNP has proposed a fee freeze on registrations, will have to stump up hundreds of dollars in tolls to use the Bruce Highway. Forget about the petrol price; Bruce Highway tollway here we come! If the toll is worked out at $1 a kilometre, it would cost about $1,600 to drive to Townsville. How is that for saving $20 on your registration? </Hansard-Body>

We heard some proposal by the shadow Treasurer to freeze electricity tariffs. Even the usually supportive media have predicted blackouts as a consequence of this idiocy. If you have a look at today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 you will see that that is the headline. They are not really noted for being supportive of any Labor Party policy. There are a number of longer term members of the opposition who will remember that the budget of Joan Sheldon in 1997 removed $900 million from the budget of electricity companies, and it has taken an inquiry and sensible financial arrangements under Labor governments to bring the electricity industry back to its current first-class operation. The tories are at it again. I suppose it is the forerunner to their proposal to sell the electricity suppliers. In my electorate, an amount of $6.42 million was allocated for a new bulk supply zone substation and associated works to the west of Yeppoon as part of a total cost of $38.1 million. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1115417"></A>
The budget provided for increases in the rebate granted to pensioners for other cost-of-living pressures where the council rebate of rates has been increased to $200 and the electricity rebate to $230, which reflects the 6.6 per cent projected increase. Members have heard that the New South Wales power costs are to increase in the high teens. They should also note that South Australia is increasing its power charges by 12 per cent--privatised electricity, by the way.</Hansard-Body>

Queenslanders enjoy a regulated tariff so that consumers throughout the state all pay the same tariff. That has cost the state varying amounts over the years including approximately $370 million in 2010-11, and it will be over $400 million this year.

Generally across the State, we are spending record funding on Health, Communities, Emergency Services, Roads (with a grant of $928M being allocated across the Fitzroy region, with $286.7M this year) and particularly $100M over three years in Smart State initiatives, $85.8M over 5 years to attract new events to support tourism and $15Bn on capital infrastructure to support 93000 jobs. Substantial expenditure has also been allocated to promote education and to ensure a great future for Queensland children including moving Grade 7 into secondary schools.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In my own Electorate, new home buyers and people who will contract to build from 1 August to 31 January will benefit from the $10000 grant which will benefit the Building industry.

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_195855" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Greenslopes--ALP) (Minister for Education and Industrial Relations) (7.58 pm): I am delighted to rise this evening to speak in support of the appropriation bills for 2011-12. As the state member for Greenslopes and Queensland’s Minister for Education and Industrial Relations, I am delighted to inform the House that once again the Bligh Labor government has demonstrated its commitment to education in the 2011-12 state budget. This is clear not only in the education projects funded for communities throughout Queensland but also in the projects that have been funded in the electorate of Greenslopes, which I am privileged to represent in this House. Initially, I will touch on some of the highlights from the budget pertaining to the Education and Training portfolio, and then I will briefly address some of the more significant initiatives for the Greenslopes electorate.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1115497"></A>
First to education and training: in 2011-12, the Bligh government will invest a massive $10.342 billion in this area, representing an increase of $443 million, or 4.5 per cent, on estimated expenditure for 2010-11. In relation to the education portfolio, the news is even better--a record operational budget of almost $7.4 billion has been allocated in the 2011-12 state budget. This funding allows the Bligh government to continue its progressive education reform agenda and give all young Queenslanders a flying start to learning and life.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115500"></A>
This investment will deliver new and renewed schools, more teachers and teacher aides, and continued support for students with special needs. Queensland already has a first-class education system and this record funding--which represents an increase to the operational budget for education of almost nine per cent--will help us to improve it even more. It allows the government to continue the substantial reform agenda that began a decade ago as Labor strove to lift the standard of education in this great state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115501"></A>
It is worthwhile reminding members about some of the highlights of that reform agenda. We introduced groundbreaking learning-or-earning laws, enabling all Queensland students to develop a pathway to further study, vocational training or employment; we added an extra year of schooling with the introduction of prep; and we have taken giant steps towards giving all children in the state access to a quality kindergarten service. We have shaken off the old ways, when education was not valued, and set aspirational targets for our schools and students. We are sending a clear message to principals, teachers and parents that we believe we can do better.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115502"></A>
We are already starting to see positive results from our reforms. Since 2008, Queensland students have improved in 19 of the 20 NAPLAN test result areas using the average scores. Overall, Queensland’s results have shown significant gains in more test result areas than any other state or territory since the NAPLAN tests began. We have also set targets for Indigenous performance improvement and we are seeing the benefits of our investments in this area. Since 2008, Indigenous Queensland students have improved in 18 of the 20 NAPLAN test result areas using the average scores. We still have some way to go to get to where we want to be but the strong signs of improvement are evident across our results.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115503"></A>
We are investing in 91 literacy and numeracy coaches, 72 summer schools and professional development of teachers in English and mathematics, and we are funding between 10 and 20 hours of intensive teaching for students in years 3 and 5 struggling to meet the national standards in literacy and/or numeracy--to name just a few of our strategies. These are part of our plan to get to the top of the class nationally, and the education results being achieved in Queensland are promising in a range of areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115504"></A>
For example, a record 93 per cent of year 12 graduates received a qualification in 2010, which represents a five per cent increase on our 2009 results. More than 81 per cent of graduates achieved a Queensland Certificate of Education in 2010--up nine per cent on the previous year. And 26,789 students were awarded a vocational education and training qualification--an increase of eight per cent and almost 60 per cent of the year 12 cohort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115505"></A>
In fact, our school-based apprenticeship and traineeship results are nothing short of outstanding. Queensland, which accounts for well over half the nation’s school based apprenticeships and traineeships, recorded growth of 14 per cent in this area in 2010--another indication of the options available to our senior secondary students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115506"></A>
But the finish line is never reached when it comes to education and we are always looking for further ways to improve our performance. That is why we have decided that year 7 should join high school in 2015. This decision was made as part of the government’s response to the A flying start for Queensland children discussion paper, and we released our response last week. The white paper outlines the important reasons why transferring year 7 to high school will be beneficial to our children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115507"></A>
Firstly, by 2015, more than half of all year 7 students will be turning 13, and it is widely recognised that 13-year-olds should be studying at high school. Secondly, with the introduction of prep in 2007, year 7 will be the eighth year of formal schooling. The eighth year of schooling has traditionally been the start of high school in Queensland for many years, and this will again be the case from 2015. Thirdly, we raised the starting age for school in 2008, meaning children will be older when they reach year 7 in 2015. Educators agree that adolescents at this age are ready for greater independence and the depth of learning that high schools provide, which is why, in most other states and territories, year 7 is already the first year of high school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115508"></A>
Finally, the introduction of the new Australian curriculum will mean greater consistency across the country in terms of what children of certain ages are studying. We want Queensland’s children to be on a level playing field with other states such as New South Wales and Victoria and they have had year 7 in high school for many years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115509"></A>
Our decision to transfer year 7 into high school has received widespread support with endorsement from key stakeholders such as the Queensland Teachers Union, the Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations, the Queensland Catholic Education Commission, Independent Schools Queensland, primary and secondary principals associations, and education academics. Before making the decision, the government consulted widely, holding 93 forums across Queensland and calling for submissions from interested parties and individuals. Through this consultation process, people told us that there were benefits in moving year 7 to secondary school, although they raised some concerns about some sections of the proposal. In particular, they asked about: the emotional maturity and readiness of students, the impact the move could have in rural and remote areas, and the financial, infrastructure and human and physical resource implications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115513"></A>
The consultation showed that forums and group submissions were more supportive of moving year 7 than submissions from individuals. When asked ‘Should year 7 be in secondary school when it is the eighth year of formal schooling?’ 84 per cent of forum respondents said yes. Group submissions recorded a 72 per cent yes vote, while 44 per cent of individual respondents were in the affirmative. This feedback was vital in shaping our decision, which includes a substantial funding package for new and refurbished classrooms and learning areas, teacher training and support, pastoral care measures for students, and extra assistance for rural and remote families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115514"></A>
More than $328 million has been allocated over four years for building works at state schools. We have also allocated $293 million for things such as teacher training and support. This includes capital grants assistance of more than $81 million to help the non-state sector make the change. In total, the government has allocated $622 million of new money over the forward estimates--a significant allocation by anyone’s measure. </Hansard-Body>

Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115518"></A>
While funding for the Year 7 move formed the centrepiece of the Education budget, there were several other substantial funding allocations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115519"></A>
For example, the State Budget outlined our continued commitment to provide up to 240 kindergarten services by 2014, so that every Queensland child has access to kindy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115520"></A>
We will ensure 85 new kindergarten services are operational by the end of 2012, including fast-tracking 40 services originally scheduled for 2013 and 2014. To do this, we have allocated $75 million in this year’s budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115521"></A>
We will also employ up to 300 extra full-time equivalent teachers and teacher aides in state schools to meet enrolment growth and support students with special needs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115522"></A>
This means the Queensland Government has created more than 10,000 new teacher and teacher aide positions in state schools since 1998--staggering figure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115523"></A>
We will create an extra 5000 teacher aide hours each week by investing $24.5 million to complete our $43 million, three-year commitment for an additional 15,000 teacher hours weekly to support Prep to Year 7 students.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115524"></A>
I am particularly pleased that we have been able to increase the maintenance budget for existing schools in this year’s budget, with a $50 million injection of new money into the new State School Investment Program, bringing the total expenditure for the financial year to $134 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115525"></A>
This means that we can fast-track maintenance at schools across the state and complete more projects sooner.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115526"></A>
The State Government will also spend more than $487 million on infrastructure in schools and kindergartens. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker--Labor governments, more than any other, recognise the life-changing potential of education. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115533"></A>
Education has had an enormous impact on my life, and it has the potential to have the same positive effects on everyone who wants to be the best they can be.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115534"></A>
This government is committed to investing in education--it’s an investment in our future and the future of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Greenslopes </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115536"></A>
Education is a key focus area for this year’s budget--right across the state and particularly in the Greenslopes electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115537"></A>
The State Budget includes numerous funding measures that specifically benefit the Greenslopes electorate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115538"></A>
Among the big winners in the budget are several schools such as Holland Park State High School, which will receive $150,000 to upgrade its quadrangle including seating and shade sails for students, and Seville Road State School’s Prep area, which gets $50,000 for a new playground. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115539"></A>
I am also pleased that $50,000 has been allocated to develop a master plan for infrastructure at Cavendish Road State High School, while Marshall Road State School will get $95,000 for a new filtration system for its swimming pool. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115540"></A>
Mt Gravatt State School will also get $50,000 for a shade cover for its new play area. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115541"></A>
On top of this, a total of $872,000 will be spent on maintaining schools in the Greenslopes electorate, as part of the State Schools Investment Program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115542"></A>
Kindergarten services in Greenslopes also get a massive boost in the 2011-12 State Budget, with $155,000 being allocated to get our kids ready for their Prep year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115543"></A>
This includes:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115544"></A>
$52,000 for Holland Park Child Care Centre</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1115546"></A>
$30,000 for Greenslopes Child Care Centre</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115547"></A>
$19,000 for Adeona Early Exploration Centre in Coorparoo</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115548"></A>
and $19,000 for Mount Gravatt West C&amp;K. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115549"></A>
Funding of $66.26 million has been allocated in the Budget to complete the $465 million second stage of the Eastern Busway from Buranda to Main Avenue, Coorparoo, which will relieve congestion for many residents in the Greenslopes electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115550"></A>
This is part of the Labor-led revolution in public transport across Brisbane’s southside which is helping to cut commuting times, reduce congestion, bring down petrol bills and help reduce our carbon footprint.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115551"></A>
There is also $7.3 million for disability services and support for carers, with funding going to local organisations such as Vision Australia, Carers Queensland and ARAFMI Queensland, and $6.35 million to build new community housing accommodation units.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115552"></A>
Mr Speaker--the Bligh Government understands the pressures on household budgets and the cost of living. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115553"></A>
That is why the State Budget includes several measures to put money back into the pockets of Greenslopes residents.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115554"></A>
As an example of this:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115555"></A>
the $113-a-year ambulance levy is being abolished from the 1st of July 2011;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115556"></A>
the Pensioners Rates Rebate will jump 11 per cent to a maximum of $200 a year;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115557"></A>
pensioners will have their electricity subsidy increased by up to $14, to a maximum payment of $230 a year; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115558"></A>
the water subsidy for pensioners will be increased by $20 to $120 a year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115559"></A>
The State Budget also includes the Queensland Building Boost, which is designed to help make housing more affordable and to stimulate the construction sector. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115560"></A>
Under this $140 million program, anyone who buys a new house or signs up to build one from the 1st of August 2011 will receive a $10,000 grant. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115561"></A>
This boost, which is available for six months, is for properties valued up to $600,000. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1115562"></A>
Conclusion </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115563"></A>
In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the 2011-12 State Budget lays the foundation for the continued prosperity of this great state--particularly in relation to education.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115564"></A>
Our record operational budget for education, coupled with our ongoing reforms and improvements, mean that our education system will be well equipped to meet the needs of our students and our state in the 21st century.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115565"></A>
It is a budget that delivers for Queensland students, delivers for Queensland schools, and delivers for the Greenslopes electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115566"></A>
It will help us to continue our reputation as a great state to live, learn and work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I commend the Bills to the House. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_200623" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Toowoomba North--ALP) (8.06 pm): At the outset, I congratulate the Treasurer on the delivery of a very successful budget. It is the fourth budget that he has delivered. I sincerely believe that we are fortunate to have such a very talented person and such a good person in Mr Fraser, the member for Mount Coot-tha, as the Treasurer of Queensland. </A></Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115575"></A>
The budget is a well-constructed document which I believe suits the unusual times Queensland has been in, bearing in mind the global financial crisis and the recent disasters by way of natural occurrences with the floods and the cyclone. Therefore, we saw first and foremost an emphasis on reconstruction throughout most of Queensland, including in my home city and my region. I was very pleased therefore to see an amount of $38 million being spent in the Toowoomba area on reconstruction and recovery works.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115576"></A>
I was also very pleased to see the emphasis on cost of living which is an issue for most Queenslanders, but particularly those on lower incomes. It was therefore very pleasing to see the ambulance levy abolished and it was particularly pleasing to see pensioners assisted with respect to their rates bills and their electricity bills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115577"></A>
The Treasurer did not lose sight of the fact that we have an obligation to future Queenslanders and the future of all of us as Queenslanders as well, and I congratulate him and the government on the decision to move grade 7 to high school and the necessary funding to start that process off. I also congratulate the Minister for Education, who has preceded me in tonight’s debate, for the efforts he has made and will continue to make in this groundbreaking reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115629"></A>
I also congratulate the Treasurer on the initiative to assist with the construction of new homes through the advance of $10,000 to be available in that period of time from August this year until the end of January next year. In my area the construction industry would be dead and done for if it had not been for the Commonwealth and the state capital works programs, particularly the Commonwealth’s BER program. Most builders in Toowoomba acknowledge the significance of that government activity over the last year or two and it is a fact that most sizeable builders in the Toowoomba area would attribute about 80 per cent of their work to government contracts. Accordingly, the construction industry is still in dire straits and I am sure this measure with respect to the $10,000 grant for the construction of new homes will provide that necessary stimulus to the construction industry, and that will have ripple effects, as we all know, on the rest of the economy. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1115633"></A>
Likewise, the very substantial measures to encourage tourism in the budget with the Smart State initiatives lead to commendation to the government. This does set the scene for a very prosperous Queensland in the coming years. The predictions are that we will move from an economic growth of nought per cent to five per cent--nought per cent because of the global economic crisis and the floods--and we will see business investment, which has been growing well above national averages, at an amount of about 27 per cent next year which will lead to the creation of an estimated 127,000 new jobs over the next two years. The Toowoomba area will benefit, along with the rest of Queensland, with the measures in the budget.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Hoolihan): Member for Condamine, the standing orders require you to go to your own seat when you enter this House. If you choose not to, please do not interject.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115641"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I acknowledge the honourable member for Condamine’s support for the Darling Downs Cropping Research and Training Centre. I also acknowledge the amount of $168,000 to be spent across the Darling Downs and West Moreton region to deliver training to Indigenous people in regional and remote areas. As I mentioned earlier, there is an amount of $38.13 million towards recovery and reconstruction projects. Earlier this week in a speech I mentioned an amount of $96 million that is going to be spent on the Warrego Highway, again in the electorate of the member for Condamine. I notice that he nods with approval about that, and I am glad to get his endorsement. Why wouldn’t he? I also acknowledge that there will be an amount of $105.5 million spent for recovery and reconstruction works for the road network generally within the Darling Downs and West Moreton region. There is an amount of $5.49 million to finish off the rail tracks work, particularly the rail going up the Toowoomba range and beyond. There is also an amount this coming financial year to be spent on the Warrego Highway and James Street on some intersections about which I spoke previously.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115646"></A>
I also acknowledge the amount of $8.6 million to be spent on electrical upgrades for substations at central Toowoomba, west Toowoomba and Charlton which are essential for the growth of the industrial and residential areas of Toowoomba. There is also an amount of $5.54 million for improving unemployment levels and skilling those who need training. I also mention an amount of $981,000 being the final expenditure necessary to complete the emergency department at the Toowoomba Hospital and the recurrent sum of $500,000 to be provided for the National Carriage Factory at the Cobb &amp; Co. Museum. All told, bearing in mind the times in which we live, the city of Toowoomba, my electorate of Toowoomba North and the region of the Darling Downs has fared very well in this budget. Again, I thank the Treasurer for his efforts. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115658"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McLINDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It does make 21, but I say from the outset that none of my previous ideas or policies are null and void. I have merely laid the foundations and I am on the third rung of a long ladder. This is also my first budget debate since creating The Queensland Party. On behalf of all Queensland Party members and supporters, I wish to present a seven-point plan which I have dubbed the level playing field seven-point plan. So this year it is the level playing field seven-point plan.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115660"></A>
I believe in Queensland and I believe in its people. But we have come to a fork in the road where we have an option to deliver budgets in a two-year political cycle or with a 20-year vision. In the last five to 10 years it has become more and more prevalent that the rich are getter richer and the poor are getting poorer. Queensland is faced with a two-speed economy, and if we do not look at the second-tier speed economy then we will find ourselves doomed in 10 to 15 years from now. The mining boom will only last so long. We need to ensure that we put mechanisms in place that are sustainable and that have longevity with a 20-year vision. Our first option is to continue with a two-year political cycle and our second option is to deliver a 20-year vision, which is exactly what The Queensland Party will do tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115663"></A>
Well may the opposition say that we have had an old, tired government for 20 years; that is merely a reflection of an old, tired opposition. The situation that Queensland faces today is not solely the government’s fault. The duty of an opposition is to, firstly, keep the government accountable and, secondly and more importantly, to provide alternative policy where it disagrees. I am sick and tired of sitting in this place on the crossbenches looking at the finger-pointing. Those in the opposition either have to agree or disagree and provide alternative policy, but that has not happened in the 2 years I have been in this place. That has been an extreme injustice and disservice to the Queensland people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115667"></A>
The first point for the level playing field seven-point plan is that the payroll tax threshold should be increased from $1 million to $5 million which will directly benefit 8,850 businesses across Queensland. That equates to around 100 businesses per electorate--per representative--in this House. We have seen our New South Wales counterparts deliver $400 million worth of rebates in payroll tax to small business. Queensland will lose small business to New South Wales if we do not have a 20-year vision and lift the threshold from $1 million to $5 million to make Queensland the most attractive place to do business in Australia. Small business is and always will be the backbone of the Queensland economy. Once the phenomena of globalisation takes place, localisation will be more important than ever. Our local communities and our small businesses need a government with a will to deliver a 20-year vision to ensure that these small businesses across each and every one of our electorates can expand and have the potential to be able to employ more people in their local communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115668"></A>
This equates to around 18 per cent of the total payroll tax revenue, and this can be funded at the top end. As I said, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The little mum and dad shops are being squeezed out, but they want to expand. When we live in a time in Queensland where mining magnates can jump from $1 billion profit one year to $3 billion or $4 billion the next year something is drastically wrong with the economies of scale in terms of revenue and profits in this state. It is not good enough and it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later before we create a society of haves and have-nots. I am sick and tired of my generation--gen Y--spending seven, eight, nine or 10 years trying to save up for a home with two incomes and continually getting slugged left, right and centre while we open our doors to foreign ownership which drains the majority of revenue away from Australia and away from Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121834"></A>
We have to put a stop to this stupidity. We have to start empowering ourselves and our communities. We have to start getting innovative. We have to start realising that these companies are laughing all the way to the bank at the expense of the Queensland taxpayer. It is not good enough, and that is why we need to lift the payroll tax threshold to $5 million with a view to abolishing it. Payroll tax was only ever meant to fund the World War II effort, which it has long since done. But it is a tax and, if you do not have a grand vision, once you have a tax it is very hard to get rid of it. When this great state got rid of death duties, we saw the growth that followed. The reduction in payroll tax is going to decrease the imposts on the top end of town as well. It will make Queensland the best state in Australia in which to run a small business. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_06_17_DAILY-104.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121835"></A>
Point 2 of the level playing field seven-point plan is that we need to look at ourselves within the parliament, within our departments and within our bureaucratic system. That is why The Queensland Party says that we need to reduce our portfolios from 18 to 12. There is a very good reason for doing this. We need to streamline the roles and responsibilities so that they come under the responsibility of one minister. Those 12 portfolios should also have a 2IC--a deputy minister. In this decentralised state it is impossible for one minister to effectively carry out their duties across the whole of Queensland and expect to be across the issues. We need 12 ministers and 12 deputy ministers. I will outline that after I have explained the seven-point plan. More importantly, we need to introduce key performance indicators and an annual review of fiscal management. So putting the politics aside, if a minister is not up to scratch and the annual review does not tick all the boxes, that person will move aside for somebody else who can deliver.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121837"></A>
 The third point in the level playing field seven-point plan--and I plead with the government to make this amendment--is to exempt stamp duty for victims of natural disasters, with a sunset clause. We cannot sit back and pass legislation that will rub salt into the wounds of those people who have already gone through a catastrophic start to this year. I plead with the Treasurer to have a stamp duty exemption for those victims of natural disasters, with a sunset clause. This is the helping hand that these Queenslanders need right now. They do not need to be slugged again with a new tax after everything they have been through. As I said, stamp duty will only exacerbate the divide between the haves and the have-nots if we do not lend a helping hand to those people and give them an out. We cannot expect them to set up shop again, start from scratch, and incur a new tax. I will say that again before I finish my speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121838"></A>
Point 4 of the level playing field seven-point plan is the abolition of vehicle registration labels, as Western Australia did in May last year. This abolition saves millions and millions of dollars not only in postage but also in the bureaucracy in the administration and the processing of those labels. The Queensland Party wants to reward those people who are doing the right thing. We will not be freezing car registration, but we will be offering five per cent discounts for those people who have a clean traffic record for a period of 12 months. But there is a catch: if people breach the traffic laws in that 12-month period they will receive a five per cent increase on their registration. The millions and millions of dollars that will be saved on car registration--as has happened in Western Australia--will be put towards that incentive of a five per cent discount, which can be funded. This is not a policy that says, ‘We will freeze it. We will find the money elsewhere or we will hit you back in three years time, and half again.’ We cannot do that. This is a rational policy. It also instils in people the value of community safety, because we have seen our road toll increase markedly over the years. Those who speed in that 12-month period will be penalised accordingly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121839"></A>
Point 5 of the level playing field seven-point plan is the retention of the state’s assets--our ports, bridges, tolls, rail, electricity and water--which is intrinsically linked with the rising cost of living. For the sake of the next generation, we have to get out of this paradigm of short-term gain for long-term pain. I will refer to that matter in much greater detail shortly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121840"></A>
Point 6 of the level playing field seven-point plan is that community benefit boards be instigated through using 50 per cent of the pokie revenue. Of the $570 million that we now receive through pokies, $285 million divided by 89 electorates across this state equates to $3.2 million, and it can be indexed every year. These boards would be chaired by a state member of parliament with a federal member, a councillor and eight members of non-profit organisations. We need to empower these communities to direct that funding. Treasury will collect and collate those applications, which will be sent to the electorates. This process creates a level playing field so that each and every one of our communities knows that they will get $3.2 million every year indexed and they will be saying where that money goes. I am sick and tired of seeing marginal seats being pork-barrelled and people being left out of the loop. This system creates a level playing field. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121841"></A>
Point No. 7 is the reinstatement of the upper house, without any extra politicians, to prevent flawed and costly legislation. We have seen that with the debacle of the water legislation. If we had a mechanism of mayors in a second tier of parliament we would not only build and strengthen the relationship between local and state governments but also define the roles and responsibilities of mayors and parliamentarians and allow them to work together, because ratepayers are spending a billion dollars in representation for 553 councillors across this state. The Local Government Act has severely undermined the role of councillors and their duties. I think that has been a great injustice in terms of that front-line level of government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121843"></A>
In relation to the portfolios, there will be a finance and cost of living portfolio. The terminology is everything and ‘cost of living’ will be included in the titles of The Queensland Party’s portfolios, which will be released next month. We will have a team of 12 spokespeople and 12 deputy spokespeople. </Hansard-Body>

 Everywhere. I have already announced six and there are another six coming next week. The Queensland Party not only has a leader inside but also will have a team on the outside.

Another portfolio will be the state assets, mines and energy portfolio because, as we have seen with the sell-off of the Abbot Point Coal Terminal at $1.8 billion, which will be paid back within nine years, because of that transaction over the 99-year lease of that terminal Queensland will lose in excess of $30 billion. That is a very short-term-vision transaction, which is there only to create a balanced book before a state election. We have to start thinking outside the square for the sake of the next generation. </Hansard-Body>

Another portfolio will be called the health, mental and disability services portfolio. We are advocating for local boards so that we can get more bang for our buck in local communities, because they know where the money needs to go. The fourth portfolio will be called the police, corrective services, emergencies services and Attorney-General portfolio. Obviously, with the money that we have saved from the abolition of the registration labels we will promote the equipping of every police vehicle with GPS and mobile registration recognition units. The police are in dire need of a helicopter, which should be based in Logan, because that area came in $16 million under budget last year, which would have funded a police helicopter for two years. </Hansard-Body>

When we look at the prisoner reoffending rate of 62 per cent we see that something is clearly wrong with our justice system. We need to be able to equip our prisoners with a sense of self-worth, the ability to earn money in prison and pay their way out of prison. That gives them self-respect and self-worth. It generates revenue for the government and it gives prisoners some dignity to get back into the community and contribute to the community they offended against. We need to drastically review the rehabilitation system in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

There will be an educational vocational and training and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders portfolio. We advocate that milk should be reintroduced into schools and that money used for educational printing should be used for printing on milk cartons so that kids can learn about recycling. We should make sure that those milk contracts go to local dairy farmers who make milk in Queensland and who employ Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1121851"></A>
There will be an entertainment, tourism and sport portfolio. I welcome the $83 million for tourism over the next four years.

In terms of environment and water, I think we need water boards in place of the mechanisms that exist now so that they can work in joint partnership with our councils.

In relation to main roads and public transport, we need to start investigating moped lanes now. In the last 10 years in Queensland there has been a 1,000 per cent increase in moped usage, but we continue to focus billions and billions of dollars on tunnels which merely creates a situation where we have gridlock and centralisation which compromises the lifestyle of Brisbane. It is so important to decentralise. </Hansard-Body>

I turn now to Child Safety, families and community services. Sport needs to be separated from Child Safety. It is insensitive. Over the last six years we have seen the amount of child services almost double. We need to give it the respect it deserves and put it into the portfolio of family and community services and stop having a political carrot with such an important and critical portfolio. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to planning, housing and decentralisation, we need to empower communities so that we distribute the wealth and power.

In relation to economic and building development, I have referred to payroll tax which we need to ultimately abolish. I would like to table a chart of the royalty rates on the Queensland government’s website. When it comes to coal, the two-tier coal royalty schedule applies. Coal companies pay seven per cent of the value up to $100 per tonne and 10 per cent of the value thereafter. We are getting completely ripped off. We are giving more and more money to people at the top end. Meanwhile, while we are going through a resources boom, we have never had the cost of living so high. There is a clear and distinct disconnect between the resources and wealth in this great state and what is being transferred to the Queensland taxpayer. </Hansard-Body>

Beaudesert, the second fastest growing region in Queensland, is about 10 years behind in its infrastructure program. I thank the Minister for Police and Corrective Services for putting $100,000 towards the earmarked Mount Tamborine fire service. They have been working out of a shipping container. I will see them next Wednesday night to deliver that good news along with the news of another $1.7 million earmarked for the 2012-13 budget. They will certainly be pleased to hear that. We also need the four lanes for the Mount Lindesay Highway and the maternity services that I have been assured are funded within the budget. We will be looking at reintroducing those maternity services in Beaudesert. We also look forward to a high school, Beaudesert high being at capacity. In time I would also like to see a tourism belt. </Hansard-Body>

I believe in this state and I believe in its people. Queensland has been in dire need of healthy, active opposition since the abolition of the upper house in 1922. The farcical budget reply speeches that have taken place in this George Street theatre over the past two days are about to come to an abrupt halt as a result of the hard work from a strong and determined team spread across this great state by a political movement known as The Queensland Party. Politics is a competition of ideas, an arena of competitive and innovative policy, a battle of wits, a public game of chess and a desire to achieve the possible for the benefit of the general populous. The fundamental elements of the body politic have been reduced to a dustbowl of an opposition without any direction. The Queensland Party was formed so that there is hope for our future to come. Queenslanders know something is wrong with our government and they know that neither the ALP nor the LNP have what it takes to steer our state into a healthy democracy and a healthy level of prosperity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127532"></A>
As for the official opposition in parliament, The Queensland Party has a very clear message to its members: if you are going to put everything on the line and go so far as to undermine the Westminster system by outsourcing, subcontracting and privatising a leader from outside the bounds of this democratic institution which has been in place since 1959, then by Jove you had better come to the table with a straight set of aces. However, this did not and has not happened. It is completely unacceptable for the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127533"></A>
Thousands of Queensland Party supporters, including myself, admit that we do not have all the answers. We understand we may be wrong at times and, of course, we are not privy to or have the capacity to counter a government with access to unlimited resources, but we Queenslanders are seeking a credible political alternative to support and enable common-sense legislation to be enacted in this House to reduce our cost of living, to provide a quality lifestyle and to ensure that we leave a proud legacy behind for the generations to come. </Hansard-Body>

(8.33 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the appropriation bills. From the outset I, too, would like to commend the shadow Treasurer on his delivery of the LNP response to the budget and outlining the LNP vision for Queensland. This government has a track record of economic mismanagement. The budget handed down by the Treasurer continues in that tradition. The budget shows a deficit of $2.134 billion for 2010-11, $4.06 billion for 2011-12 and the total owed forecast to reach $84.9 billion by 2014-15. The figures speak for themselves. Labor has squandered opportunities for Queenslanders. The fact remains that amidst one of the biggest mining booms on record Labor managed to lose the state’s AAA credit rating and burden us with record debt. What do these colossal figures mean for Queenslanders? It means that Queensland ends up paying around $595,000 in interest every hour on the hour of every day of every week. The fact is this debt was being generated well before the global financial crisis and the recent natural disasters. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127540"></A>
The Treasurer is at a loss to explain the Bligh Labor government’s appalling track record of reckless spending and sky-high deficits which impact the livelihoods of everyday Queenslanders. Under this government we have seen record debt, soaring power bills and increased water bills. Public transport costs have gone up 15 per cent and will increase by 15 per cent every year until 2014. Rego will continue to increase and, of course, there is the scrapping of the 8c a litre fuel subsidy--another broken election promise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127541"></A>
The budget offers a number of sweeteners designed to take the government into the next election and to mask a bungled economy. Of course, some of those sweeteners were no more than backflips, such as the much-heralded axing of its ambulance levy, a levy which was opposed by this side when it was originally introduced in 2003. It offers a few concessions to address the horrendous cost-of-living expenses but let us be clear: these cost-of-living increases are a direct result of Labor’s economic mismanagement. As the shadow Treasurer said, we have a Labor government that wasted the boom years and never planned for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127542"></A>
I would now like to direct my comments to my shadow portfolio area of disability services. Labor has continued its appalling tradition of failing to deliver facilities and services to people with disabilities. In the 2010-11 budget nearly 1,500 fewer people with disabilities received accommodation and community access services, while there was a cut of nearly 1,900 services received by people with disabilities. Of these 1,900, a whopping 1,746 are community access services. These services facilitate active participation in the community, they provide benefit beyond a monetary value, giving people increased independence and opportunity, confidence and interaction. To cut these services has disadvantaged and deprived vulnerable people, people who depend on basic disability services to be able to participate in the community to their fullest potential. If that were not bad enough, this was combined with a reduction in the amount of government spend on people with disabilities, with up to $2,140 less spent per person.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127543"></A>
How can people with disabilities be expected or encouraged to reach their full potential in the face of these massive cuts to services. There is considerable room for improvement. Ensuring those with disabilities have real opportunities in education, employment and community participation is a crucial priority for the LNP, particularly as Labor has consistently failed to make advancements in this area. I note in the 2011-12 highlights that the government has listed additional funding of $7.4 million to expand support for young people with a disability leaving school or the child protection system. This is a very important initiative, and whilst it is welcome I question just how far $7.4 million is likely to stretch given the number of Queensland students with a severe disability who would surely deserve this support package. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127544"></A>
Too often it is the case that a parent is forced to leave the workforce in order to provide full-time care to their child after they have left school. Many people I have spoken to, including constituents within my electorate of Aspley, have faced this problem and I understand just how difficult it is for carers. These parents work so hard to provide opportunities for their children throughout their schooling and then find the greatest difficulty often comes after the school years are finished and there is really no room in the disability system for them to progress their educational future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133246"></A>
It is important that we get the balance right, not only so that Queensland families are not disadvantaged financially but also so that individuals with a disability can achieve the level of independence they are willing and able to maintain. The Bligh government’s Positive Futures program has been a centrepiece of Labor’s policy and legislation for disabilities. This initiative was born out of Justice Carter’s report, <Hansard-Italic>
Challenging behaviour and disability--a targeted response, </Hansard-Italic>
which focused on the support needs of individuals with a cognitive or intellectual disability who exhibit severely challenging behaviour. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1133252"></A>
A purpose-built facility at Wacol will provide accommodation for people with an intellectual disability who are on a forensic order as part of a program that aims to reduce offending behaviours and help reintegrate the individual into their community. A total of $9.664 million was spent on Wacol, which is $7.7 million less than budgeted. That is an underspend of 44 per cent. Despite its rush to pass the forensic disability legislation, the government has still not fully finished the infrastructure needed. It has fallen short on delivery, and by a lot. Similarly, the Wacol infrastructure redevelopment suffered an underspend of $3.1 million, or 56 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133254"></A>
When I spoke to the Forensic Disability Bill, I indicated that its provisions were limited to helping 10 people at any one time. Those 10 people would likely require help over an extended period. At the time the bill was being debated, there was already a waiting list of 16 suitable candidates, which begged the question why only 10 were being catered for. As I said at the time, it is an important step in the right direction but there is still a lot to be done. Now it is becoming clear that the project is beyond the scope of Labor’s budgeting abilities. In 2006, the Carter report recommended that the development of the total reform be executed within a period of two years. The Bligh government is now in year four of six and cannot even meet its own budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133255"></A>
Positive Futures deals with the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. These are people with a disability who pose a risk to themselves or others in the community. While the Carter report is an applauded, valuable and excellent document, the implementation of the recommendations have been a far cry from the spirit of the report. Particularly brutal has been the impact on our community sector. Non-government organisations were not engaged in consultation and are struggling to keep up with compliance costs. They make a remarkable contribution in this sector but receive no support from a government that is struggling under its own weighted bureaucracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133256"></A>
The government likes to forget that the non-government sector does its work in disability services out of sheer dedication and compassion. These are people who want the best outcomes for their clients, and to be treated almost as the enemy in government reforms is a truly disappointing attitude. Providing disability services is not about finding political selling points; it is about consistently providing the best care and support to all people with disabilities and their families. It is about helping them reach their full potential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133257"></A>
There are two parts to the puzzle and it is not complicated. The government is there to provide the simplest, most effective resourcing and support of the non-government sector, and it does this to provide the most effective and supportive care for people with disabilities, to help them make the most of opportunities and participation and essentially provide the best possible quality of life. Not only has government failed to complete the two-piece puzzle; it also has lost all the pieces and is trying to join together the new pieces called red tape, cost, bureaucracy and inefficiency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133258"></A>
The government’s $38 million disability information system has similarly been trumpeted as a shiny diamond of this government’s disability services delivery. It comprises the Growing Stronger program and the Disability Services Queensland Information System, or DISQIS. The Bligh government has stated that the program is about ‘working smarter with the funds we have’. Ironically, it, too, has been overbudgeted and underspent in past years. DISQIS has been developed to provide Disability Services Queensland with up-to-date and reliable information on the needs of clients and to enhance departmental performance in planning and service delivery. It is targeted at improving management of information. In 2011-12, a further $5.4 million is budgeted for DISQIS. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133260"></A>
It is baffling how this Labor government can continue to pump money into an IT system when people with disabilities are suffering cuts to important day-to-day services. In fact, the total disability capital budget lost nearly one-quarter, down from $40 million to $30 million. That is a pretty sorry outcome. On the day the budget papers were released, the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 published a story entitled ‘Plea for disability funds’. Support groups claim that Queensland government spending on disability services lags by about $180 million. That means that a boost to the budget of $180 million would have put Queensland on par with other states in terms of average funding per person. For too long, Queenslanders with disabilities have had to suffer living in the state with the lowest disability funding per capita. The minister continues to talk about unmet needs, but the reality is that he has failed to secure adequate funds in this year’s budget for many of our most vulnerable Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133261"></A>
In the area of community mental health, the Bligh government has highlighted its $38 million investment in recruiting 126 temporary community mental health staff across Queensland to provide specialist counselling and therapy services to those experiencing psychological trauma as a consequence of the recent natural disasters. A good deal of this funding is provided by the federal government under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. This is certainly a positive initiative, but once again it is important to see the big picture. As I pointed out to the House, community mental health has been left off the map by this government. This showcases beyond doubt its total lack of understanding when it comes to the need for community focused support, early intervention, prevention and raising awareness. Having listened to representatives from the community sector, I understand just how important those measures are. I will also say that they are doing a fantastic job with what little they have. There needs to be a synergy between clinical and community approaches to treating mental illness, which this government is failing to grasp. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133263"></A>
On this side of the House we do understand how badly the natural disasters have affected people’s lives. Some lost everything. The electorates of some of my colleagues saw devastation of unfathomable proportions, and the feelings of loss experienced by many throughout our state cannot be expected to dissipate overnight. However, mental illness can manifest at any time in a person’s life and its onset is not always easy to understand or explain. It does not always take an extreme event like a natural disaster for someone to experience mental illness or depression. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133265"></A>
Recently I spoke to many parents at the national White Wreath Day service who, years on, are at a loss as to why their child had taken their own life. Those people are committed to seeing the message about suicide and the importance of early intervention reach the wider community so that others will not be forced to experience the heartache that they have felt. Mental illness and suicide are problems throughout our community and particularly so in regional areas. We cannot afford to ignore the statistics, but that is exactly what this budget does. Too many lives are lost to suicide each year and there is an urgent need to reach out to the community sector with the support they need and deserve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133266"></A>
I will direct my comments now to the area of child safety. I start by commending the work of child safety officers. Their job is not an easy one, but they play a central role in ensuring the safety of children and the promise of a brighter, better future. I know that Child Safety does not offer the same excitement of events as the minister’s competing portfolio, but the minister’s lack of attention to the issues and crises in Child Safety is hurting all who work or come in contact with it. I acknowledge that their working conditions are far from ideal, but, again, it is a job they take on for all the right reasons: care, compassion and the need to make life better for some of the most vulnerable and hurting people in our community. In this budget, the Bligh Labor government has once again failed to properly invest in the protection of our children in state care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133267"></A>
The Minister for Child Safety failed to adequately answer my question without notice on Tuesday morning. What is more, he challenged us to ‘wait and see what happens at 2.30’. We waited. What we saw was that Labor has spent just $2.3 million of its $11.8 million Child Safety capital budget. That is an 81 per cent underspend. It is absolutely unbelievable that the minister would be getting excited about delivering such an underwhelming message to the child safety community. The LNP is committed to protecting children at risk of harm. The welfare of our children is a priority. Too often, Labor has allowed them to get caught up in bureaucratic red tape.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139259"></A>
I have previously highlighted to the House non-government child safety agencies’ aim for case loads of 12 or 13 cases per officer, but the minister’s department averages 22.4 cases per officer. It has been as high as 32 cases per officer. How can the minister expect even the most dedicated staff to survive in those conditions? As it is, the department of child safety has the highest staff turnover of any government department--no doubt an indication of the high intensity and demanding working conditions they endure as a consequence of this Labor government’s underresourcing. These higher-than-average case loads make it extremely difficult for child safety workers to give the attention they would like to each case. We are seeing a department that is dreadfully underresourced and its staff are terribly overloaded. Over the past year the number of children in care has risen from 7,690 to 7,900 children, or an increase of about three per cent. However, there is no promise of further funding to meet the increasing needs of children in the state’s care.</Hansard-Body>

 It is no secret that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are over-represented in Child Safety statistics. In 2010-11, 43.1 per 1,000 Indigenous Australian children were subject to protective orders, compared to a rate of 5.1 for other children. In the last budget, a total estimated cost of $24.4 million was being committed to child safety services for Indigenous communities, with total expenditure standing at $9.4 million. This year’s budget presents an altogether different picture. Funding has been cut by more than half, with the total estimated cost now standing at $12.4 million and expenditure to date at $1.2 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139265"></A>
The same can be said again for residential and therapeutic residential care facilities. Budgeting for residential care facilities has plummeted, with over $19 million scrapped from providing children with shelter. If the money is not being directed to help children at risk in our society access important services, then where is it going? The minister needs to take a look over these figures which are a sad indictment, both on his performance in this very important portfolio area and on the state Labor government. The child safety system is crying out for more and more resources, better futures for our children and a stronger investment. Instead, it is suffering under the ham-fisted management of an out-of-touch Labor government.</Hansard-Body>

I will briefly comment on how my own electorate fared in this budget. My comments will be brief because sadly, for the people of Aspley, there is not much to celebrate. For this government, neglecting Aspley has become the norm around budget time--same old problems with no hint of action. There is the issue of gridlock on Gympie Road. Where public transport services have been increased, there is a lack of satisfactory infrastructure to foster these enhancements. Take, for example, the horrific level crossing on Telegraph Road, where motorists waiting at boom gates during peak hour are no doubt cursing the current transport minister’s ‘revolutionised’ new rail timetable. I have consistently raised the need for an upgrade at this intersection and it has been consistently neglected by the Bligh government. It is an extremely important piece of infrastructure that would see improved safety and reduced congestion, particularly now that the new Caboolture line timetable will see 16 trains run through the Telegraph Road level crossing during peak hour. It does not take a genius to work out that a train every four minutes creates nightmarish congestion at level crossings. That is why LNP leader Campbell Newman has announced that construction of a flyover would be a first-term priority for an LNP government. We are committed to producing positive and tangible results for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139267"></A>
There are a few areas in which Aspley has benefited from this budget. Funding has been allocated for construction of additional accommodation at the Aspley Special School. The money budgeted for a kindergarten at Bald Hills State School is simply a recycled announcement from last year’s budget and is not a new project. After two years of lobbying Main Roads, it was pleasing to see that funds have finally been allocated for the well overdue sound barriers along Gympie Road at Carseldine. Bald Hills Road will also be resurfaced in parts. </Hansard-Body>

The Premier and her government can talk up this budget until the cows come home, but Queenslanders are tired of the debt, the soaring cost-of-living pressures and the arrogance that have become the defining features of this Labor government. Only a can-do LNP government will end the waste, balance the budget, restore Queensland’s AAA credit rating and work hard to generate wealth, prosperity and jobs for all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

(Brisbane Central--ALP) (8.53 pm): I rise to support the 2011 state budget which I believe features strong funding for community support, education and transport for Brisbane Central. More importantly, this budget creates and maintains a jobs focus, even though we have had a summer of disasters and the required $6.8 billion repair bill. This ‘steady as she goes budget’ will strengthen the state’s structural budgetary position. Those are not my words but those of Standard &amp; Poor’s credit analyst. The best policy position that this government can deliver to Queenslanders is the maintenance of a strong focus on jobs, both in maintaining jobs and job creation, together with a well funded and delivered training program. These two crucial issues for working families are exactly what this budget will deliver. </Hansard-Body>

This budget will deliver a $15 billion Capital Works Program during 2011-12, supporting 93,000 jobs and building the infrastructure of the future. This follows the previous financial year’s spend of a record $17 billion, which has delivered jobs and more jobs for tradies, electricians, engineers and construction workers as well as investing in our state’s future. No-one in this House can honestly stand up and complain about the amount of capital and infrastructure investment that this government has delivered during our term. The numbers speak for themselves and the projects--either delivered or being delivered--are too numerous to mention. They include such things as Airport Link, new hospitals, new schools, new roads, new bridges, drought proofing South-East Queensland and the best education reforms that this state has ever seen--to mention but a few. In fact, I strongly believe that the introduction of the prep year and the announced building works to move year 7 into secondary school in 2015 are some of the best education reforms that I will see in my lifetime. They are great policies delivered by a Labor government.</Hansard-Body>

 This government’s 2006 ‘learning or earning’ reforms have achieved a most successful outcome, with the proportion of young people with a year 12 or vocational education qualification increasing to 88 per cent. We are also rolling out 240 kindergartens across Queensland. All of this has been delivered in spite of the global financial crisis and the enormous rebuilding expenditure of $6.8 billion that this state faces following our natural disasters. But make no mistake: this budget is focused on the task ahead, grabbing the opportunity at hand for the betterment and prosperity of all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

I have listened to most speeches from those opposite bemoaning the state debt. I can honestly say that I have never met a successful businessperson, homeowner or entrepreneur who has not incurred debt at some time. In the past governments at both a state and a federal level have all incurred debt to deliver much needed infrastructure, for example, the Story Bridge, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and the list can go on. My point is that in times of economic downturn and, indeed, strong growth periods, as Queensland has experienced, it is incumbent upon governments to step up and deliver the projects of the future and the much needed jobs for working families. That is what this Labor government has delivered not only during times of hardship, such as this state’s worst drought in modern history, which is conveniently forgotten by those opposite, but also during periods of strong growth--something I might add that was never addressed by the federal Howard government during its time in office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139287"></A>
The Howard government did very little in the area of additional funds for Queensland’s roads, hospitals, public housing, education and training. It abolished the training levy and now we have a skills shortage. It did not increase funding for university places and kept the number of doctors in training at the same level for over a decade and now we have a doctor shortage. It did not invest in housing and now we have an affordable housing shortage and a problem. It did not invest in roads and now we have a roads problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139288"></A>
The truth of the matter is that it is easy to save money when you do not spend any or invest in our future. But beware because what you do not spend today as a nation on the essentials will undoubtedly catch up with you. This state government was left to pick up the expenses when it came to delivering for the people of Queensland. Ironically, in times of boom, the Howard government did attack workers and their families through Work Choices with the most aggressive stripping back of workers’ rights and entitlements that this country has ever seen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150874"></A>
The Howard government could not help itself and it paid the political price. However, I never heard those opposite complain or lobby the then Howard government for its failures to invest adequately in this great state and in its workforce. But ironically, member after member on the opposite side has risen in this House to demand more money for their areas and at the same time complain about the state debt--money needed to invest in our future and fill the large funding gap left by the Howard government. Only now are we receiving vital additional federal funds from the Gillard Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

But, in spite of this obvious neglect, what do we find in Queensland? Business investment grew by an estimated 13 per cent this financial year, exceeding the national result of 4.5 per cent and the forecast of 9.5 per cent. Business, unlike those opposite, is not talking down this state. It is sending a loud message that Queensland is the state to be, that this is where it is happening. With this growth, the GFC and natural disasters and associated infrastructure expenditure come pressures on cost of living, an outcome that this government is well aware of. That is why we have the most comprehensive rebates and assistance packages for those who need a hand with the cost of living. Our pensioners deserve our support and I welcome this budget’s increases in subsidies for local government rates, electricity bills and the SEQ water charges for the elderly in our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150876"></A>
In addition, I welcome the abolition of the ambulance levy on electricity bills, delivering a saving of $113 to around 1.4 million electricity account holders, whereby now the ambulance will still arrive but the bill will not. The government will continue to provide free ambulance cover for all Queenslanders by meeting the full costs of the Ambulance Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150877"></A>
The great Australian dream is still buying and owning your own home, and I welcome the massive $140 million Queensland Building Boost program to assist young people into the housing market. This program will assist first home buyers and Queenslanders buying a newly constructed home or signing a contract to build a new home with a $10,000 grant from the state, and it will keep construction workers in jobs. First home owners can now receive up to $17,000--real assistance to get a roof of their own over their head. This program will stimulate activity, promote supply and support jobs in the housing industry, which is currently undergoing a slow period, as I understand to be the case in my very own electorate. This program is targeted and time limited but offers great advantages and grants to those who take up this opportunity to make their dream of homeownership a reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150880"></A>
I also warmly welcome a commitment in this state budget to continue the successful drink-safe precincts trial for another 12 months, with an allocation of $4.27 million. This means greater police numbers, better transport options, special safe zones and community support. This funding now fully pays for the two-year trial put in place by this Labor government, ensuring safer venues where young people can enjoy Brisbane’s world-class night life. This is great news for the licensees and patrons of Fortitude Valley in my electorate and demonstrates this government’s commitment to young people and the Valley precinct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150882"></A>
This contrasts--and how!--with the recent BCC budget that stripped funds from the community supported Chaplain Watch, removed the position of place manager, Fortitude Valley--just when things were finally getting cleaned up in the Valley--and removed dedicated officers to the Valley area working with the community. The BCC has turned its back on the Valley and inner city, ignoring the filth for years--which, ironically, was finally being cleaned up--and allowing deteriorating buildings posing a safety hazard to patrons to rot by totally disregarding its local responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150884"></A>
In fact, I am sick and tired of the BCC, which under the previous Lord Mayor started destroying Brisbane’s inner city. The inner-city suburbs have been destroyed with untold advertising pollution from the failed CityCycle scheme, parking meters everywhere, overdevelopment, extraordinary rate hikes for unit owners--some in the vicinity of 300 per cent and 400 per cent--and failed refurbishments like King George Square. In contrast, this state budget helps Queenslanders into homes and jobs, provides cost-of-living relief and delivers on education and training. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

. I have received the Speaker’s approval and I have emailed a copy to Hansard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150887"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150888"></A>
In fact, I welcome the record spend on Health and Education, which since being the member for Brisbane Central I have seen the schools in my electorate being transformed. The extra maintenance funding for Kelvin Grove and Brisbane Central State Schools is most welcome and I commend the budget on the allocation of more than $328m for building works and new classrooms as well as further allocations for new teachers and teacher training.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150889"></A>
Community infrastructure is vitally important in my electorate as many people in need often frequent the inner city. Therefore, funds allocated for community support for people with a disability or mental illness are most welcome, as is funding for affordable housing going to BHC to construct and complete over 160 units in the inner city.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150890"></A>
Protecting the environment is most important for many residents of Brisbane Central and I believe the budget allocation of $60m extension to the ClimateSmart Home Service to help Queenslanders reduce their energy consumption, electricity bill and carbon footprint is money well spent. I know this service has helped me to save energy and I urge all residents to avail themselves of this service.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150891"></A>
I also welcome the continuing investment in helping troubled youth through our youth justice initiative and expanding help for domestic violence sufferers, especially in indigenous communities. I believe that no-one should live in fear, regardless of their family or skin colour.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150892"></A>
Make no mistake, this budget is about jobs, easing the pressures on cost of living for pensioners and those most in need and delivers on the community needs of the future. In spite of tough times from mother nature and the global economic conditions, this state budget promotes real opportunity for business and ordinary Queenslanders, delivers record funds for health and education and training, provides for the workforce of tomorrow and provides for the inner city and regions alike. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150893"></A>
I commend the Treasurer and his staff on tackling these difficult times front on and finding the balance in this budget where standing still is never an option.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.04 pm): I rise to speak to the appropriation bills and to the Community Ambulance Cover Levy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The electorate of Mount Isa is a microcosm of the state. I have made and will continue to make representation for improved infrastructure and services for the people right across my electorate. This budget has continued on with the strong work we have been able to achieve in the Mount Isa electorate over the last few years.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150901"></A>
I want to particularly thank the Treasurer for the exceptional job he and his staff do. I acknowledge the great leadership of the Premier and the ministers, who, I have to say, have a great appreciation of the Mount Isa electorate and take into consideration the uniqueness of my vast electorate. I am appreciative of that recognition and the responsiveness which is always forthcoming.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150902"></A>
This budget again reflects the ongoing and continuing commitment to the just-on $90 million being invested in health facilities across the electorate. Projects are well underway, with the $65 million at the Mount Isa Base Hospital and the Winton Hospital. The Dajarra and Burketown clinics are almost completed and later this year we will see the commencement of the $6.5 million 10-bed aged low-care unit at the Cloncurry Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150903"></A>
In terms of emergency services, we will also start construction on the $2.39 million ambulance station in Normanton and complete the new ambulance station adjoining the new hospital in Winton. Again, I recognise the incredible work of my QAS officers right across the electorate. You could not hope to have a more hardworking and dedicated bunch of people looking after the people on your patch. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150904"></A>
I am exceptionally proud of the funding which has come into my electorate for health, and indeed for every area, in previous budgets and again this year. We know that providing top-grade hospitals and clinic facilities is vital to health delivery in my electorate. However, while we can have the best facilities, the key component of our health service is the people who deliver health services 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks of the year. I have to say that I have witnessed the hard work and commitment of the incredibly dedicated staff right across centres in my electorate, and I acknowledge and sincerely thank them for that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150905"></A>
As with health, I am delighted with the funding for education in this year’s budget. Two areas of funding are particularly pleasing--the $400,000 for new teacher accommodation in Burketown and the $50,000 contribution for the new school drop-down facility at the Barkly Highway State School in Mount Isa. Providing quality education facilities is always a key priority for me.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150907"></A>
I want to acknowledge the work of the Barkly School Safe Committee, led by the highly organised and fantastic parent volunteer Janelle Stuart-Russell and all the members of the committee and P&amp;C along with the staff of the school, who I have enjoyed working with immensely, in getting this vital and much needed safety zone established. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150909"></A>
Right across my electorate we are seeing a big investment in school maintenance. We all know that our schools are nothing without the dedicated teachers and staff, and I particularly thank the teachers and staff of the Spinifex junior and senior campuses in Mount Isa for the truly compassionate and caring work they are doing with our students. A thankyou must also go to Miska, our school chaplain. He is a terrific young bloke whom I have a great admiration for. Due to the amount of time that this debate has taken, I seek leave to have the remainder of speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

Preparations for the move to year 7 has also been funded into this budget and I am delighted that Minister Cameron Dick will be visiting Mount Isa and Julia Creek next week to talk to our families about the plans for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150927"></A>
In late 2009 the Premier Anna Bligh and the Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education and Children announced ten new Children and Family Centres for Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150928"></A>
Three of these centres are in the Mount Isa Electorate, Mount Isa, Doomadgee and Mornington Island.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150929"></A>
The Child and Family Centre will target the needs of Indigenous families and their young children. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150930"></A>
The Child and Family centres will commence with the funding allocations in this year’s budget. $3.01 million for Doomadgee Child And Family Centre at Doomadgee State School at a total cost of $3.2 Million and $6.08 Million for Mornington Island Child &amp; Family Centre at Mornington Island State School at a total cost of $6.41 Million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150931"></A>
The Mount Isa Centre is yet to be finalised but when the final details are ironed out this centre will deliver services to meet the needs of Mount Isa families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150932"></A>
Mr Speaker, this budget is looking after our families and our pensioners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150933"></A>
The abolition of the ambulance levy will benefit 1.4 million Queensland families and small business with $113.00 removed from their electricity bills.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150934"></A>
Every Queenslander no matter where you live will still enjoy free coverage.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150935"></A>
This budget has also recognised and continued to look after our pensioners with the increase of the Local Government Rates subsidy being increased by 11% to $200.00 per year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150936"></A>
Electricity rebates for pensioners have also been increased to $230.00 per year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150937"></A>
The $10,000 grant combined with the existing first-home owner’s grant of $7,000 on offer for first home buyers, as well as no stamp duty on properties valued at up to $500,000, is a boost that I hope will be made good use of in the North West.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150938"></A>
Mr Speaker, we will be building two new Neighbourhood Centres in Winton and Mount Isa. These centres provide community and family support for our local people to access much needed services. These centres also provide services for people in crisis and again, while we welcome the new buildings, it’s important to recognise and thank the people who deliver the services through these most valuable centres.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150939"></A>
Mr Speaker, Training and jobs remain a number one priority in my electorate. We know that through the expansion of the mining sector in the North West Minerals Province opportunities for training, skilling, a rewarding job and a good life are open to all.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150940"></A>
Mr Speaker, just last week I attended the 6th graduation of trainees from the Dugalunji Aboriginal Corporations and the Dugalunji Civil and Mining Pre-vocational Training Company. The Dugalunji Aboriginal Corporation and their sister organisation Myuma have developed an effective model for assisting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people towards joining the workforce. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150941"></A>
On that day in Camooweal last week, 20 of the 28 trainees had full time positions to go to. The success of this incredible organisation and the training provided for Indigenous people is a great credit to Colin Saltmere and his fantastic team. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150942"></A>
I may never get the opportunity to be a top ticket holder of a footy team, but this for me is the equivalent and I will continue to ensure that we maintain funding through Skilling Queenslanders for Work and the Green Army and partnerships with this organisation and other organisations in my electorate who are delivering the reality of closing the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150943"></A>
Mr Speaker, funding for the Mount Isa Electorate in this year’s budget is extensive.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150944"></A>
We are continuing to build houses right across the electorate in both public and government housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150945"></A>
We will with the Commonwealth Government invest over $10 million in Indigenous Housing in Mornington Island and Doomadgee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150946"></A>
In Burketown it is teacher accommodation and in Doomadgee $1.64 million has been allocated for Police Housing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150947"></A>
Further government housing of $1.9 million will be to construct a multi unit complex in Mount Isa.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150948"></A>
This budget has covered off on the many other areas of infrastructure in Energy, Rail, Water and Roads.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150949"></A>
My electorate leads in the development of Geothermal Energy and this budget allocates funds for a total upgrade of the Geothermal Power plant in Birdsville. The total project cost of this upgrade is up to $13 million, $4.1 million of which has been committed in the coming financial year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150950"></A>
The upgrade will mean that the Ergon Energy’s 80 kilowatt Birdsville geothermal power station will have increased capacity 300-400 kilowatts as well as providing a valuable understanding of the latest technology available. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150951"></A>
This upgrade effectively represents a complete overhaul of the existing station and will deploy new technology developed right here in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150952"></A>
Mica Creek Power Station in Mount Isa will see a further $18.91 million for improvements including overhauls. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150953"></A>
$433,000 has been funded for the establishment of a new 132/11kV zone substation and associated works in the Sunset area to the north of Mount Isa to ensure adequate supply capacity for the rapid growth in this area at a total cost of $37.3 million. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150954"></A>
This financial year will see $3.8 million go towards the development of the Cloncurry solar farm at a total cost of $5.7 million. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150955"></A>
Mr Speaker, one of the greatest benefits to the people of my electorate and right across regional Queensland is the government’s continuation of the multi-million dollar subsidies for the equalisation of the electricity tariffs. This year funding of $411 million will be applied to ensure that the same tariff for electricity applies in Burketown as it does in Clayfield.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150956"></A>
We will spend $24.9 million on the road network within the North West Region, and more than $66 million on restoring damage in Boulia, Burketown, Normanton, Cloncurry, Croydon, Bedourie, Flinders, Mount Isa and Winton.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150957"></A>
Mr Speaker, as with all infrastructure investment in my electorate, roads money translates to jobs, jobs, jobs. Jobs for Council workers, Jobs for RoadTek workers, jobs for many, many contractors across the electorate. Jobs for training programs such as Myuma and the Dugalunji Civil and Mining Construction company. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150958"></A>
While the Carpentaria Mineral Province is starting to fire up with many new developments planned and expansion of existing mines to come on line over the next 2-5 years we have a strong commitment to managing problems caused by past mining practices. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150959"></A>
We have experienced first hand over the past few years results of those old and outdated mining practices.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150960"></A>
Our government will be investing a further $24.2 million over four years for mine management and rehabilitation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150961"></A>
$6 million of this operational and capital funding will be invested during 2011-12 in my electorate. Mount Oxide north of Mount Isa and the old Federation Mine at Croydon will receive funding to provide long-term reduction of safety and environmental risks, and minimise potential spills of contaminated water from the sites.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150962"></A>
While mining practices and regulations have changed, meaning companies are now required to rehabilitate land when mining operations wind up, we want to work with the industry to ensure legacy issues can be dealt with well into the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150963"></A>
As we know our government has made massive funding contributions to Water infrastructure in the North West. $40 million to connect Cloncurry township to Lake Julius has proven to be a great boost to investment and security in that community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150964"></A>
The Water investment to the Mount Isa Water Board will provide $1 million towards the completion of the upgrade and replacement of Lake Moondarra pipeline, at a total cost of that project which is $12.1 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150965"></A>
$825,000 to design and install water fluoridation plant for water supplied to Mount Isa City Council at a total cost of $1.5 million, $450,000 towards Mount Isa Water Board minor capital works projects and $150,000 towards the improvement of the Col Popple Pump, the purpose of this project is to review the pump sizes with a view to upgrading for future demand.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker, we will continue our strong support for our Indigenous Councils and provide funds which assist in lieu of rates by providing $1.77 million to Doomadgee and $1.26 million towards council services in Mornington Island.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150967"></A>
We do not stop with our support just for councils we are funding $80,000 towards Indigenous Economic Development projects in both Doomadgee and Mornington. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150968"></A>
Mornington Island also is provided with $741,000 towards revenue replacement for Indigenous Councils divesting or surrendering profitable general liquor licences.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150969"></A>
Mr Speaker, many areas and services and programs will continue to be budgeted and delivered across all Government and non-government agencies in my electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150970"></A>
I acknowledge and thank the many workers in Government departments and community organisations for the work with they do across my electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150971"></A>
I was delighted last year to secure the continued operations of the service provision of $1.68 million to provide short-term sobering up support services for intoxicated men and women and provide a Cell Visiting Service to the Mount Isa Police Watch house.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150972"></A>
This is a vital service, and could have failed if not for the hard work of department officers and the North West Queensland Indigenous Social Services organisation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150973"></A>
We will continue to fund major upgrades across our National Parks in the electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150974"></A>
And $100,000 is provided for a Business Development Manager to drive the development, promotion and growth of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum located at Winton.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150975"></A>
Mr Speaker, in conclusion there are a few items which I am still pursuing for projects in my electorate and I will keep working on them.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1150976"></A>
I further give my commitment to represent the needs of all the people of my electorate and most importantly I will continue to support the work of our government which delivers right across the state.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Hon. SD FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_210848" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (Minister for Government Services, Building Industry and Information and Communication Technology) (9.08 pm): This year’s state budget is all about the future. It is about managing growth, tackling congestion and delivering major infrastructure projects. It is about putting Queensland on track to benefit from the next wave of economic growth, as we recover from the effects of the global financial crisis.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1150984"></A>
Unlike Campbell Newman and the opposition--who refuse to reveal any costed policies to Queenslanders--we are not afraid to inform the public of our plans. We have laid out our priorities and exposed them to public scrutiny, and we want Queenslanders to know our plans for the state’s future. Some of these policies involve tough choices and hard decisions. We are prepared to tackle the tough issues to create a brighter future for all Queenslanders and we are committed to building a Queensland where there are more jobs, better schools and hospitals, and better roads and public transport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151048"></A>
This is also a budget about reconstruction, recovery and helping Queenslanders rebuild after the most devastating natural disasters in our history. I represent an electorate that was hard hit by the Brisbane River flooding. Estimates indicate some 150 streets and up to 1,600 homes were affected by the floods, with many houses totally submerged and hundreds with water through their living area.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1151051"></A>
Our community is recovering bit by bit, and the local neighbourhoods are slowly returning to normal. As a local member, the best announcement contained in the budget is the funding for a new community centre based in Yeronga. One of the results of natural disasters is that they identify needs in our communities, and local recovery efforts made clear there was a need for a community centre in the Yeronga area. Currently, the former preschool building at the Yeronga State School is being used as a volunteer-run flood recovery centre. This centre is providing support and comfort to a number of local people as they go through the difficult task of rebuilding their homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151052"></A>
The commitment in the budget of $550,000 will enable a permanent community centre to be developed in the preschool following completion of the volunteer flood recovery activities. Recently, I announced $50,000 in funds to enable the centre to continue providing support to local people through to the end of November through those voluntary activities. The community centre will be managed by the Department of Communities and the funds will enable an upgrade of the existing preschool and the employment of an experienced full-time community service manager to coordinate the centre’s day-to-day activities. This is a great announcement for the community I represent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151053"></A>
Tonight I will outline further local announcements and detail some of the key budget initiatives within the portfolio areas I am responsible for. Before I do, I would like to comment briefly on the contribution of the shadow minister for government services, building industry and ICT. It astounds me that the shadow minister for building industry can respond to this budget and not mention the $10,000 Building Boost for new home builders. The Housing Industry Association spoke up in support. The Master Builders Association Queensland spoke up in support. The Queensland Property Council supports it. The Urban Development Institute of Australia supports it. Queenslanders building a new home support it too. Yet the shadow minister simply ignores it. The building industry is worth more than $45 billion to the Queensland economy and employs 225,000 Queenslanders. The industry has been struggling, yet the shadow minister does not welcome the stimulus in this budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151055"></A>
I note also that the shadow minister has announced a new employment screening policy for all state government employees. This would see all prospective state government employees subjected to a Google and Facebook check. Let me just look at Google alone. This morning, a Google search on Ros Bates generated 3.2 million results. How many hours would it take to search through these results? And what if nothing untoward were revealed in the first three million? Would you stop there or would you not?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151057"></A>
If you then search on Rosslyn Bates, you come up with 5.76 million results. Would you stop at five million and ignore what was in the other 760,000? How long would it take to trawl through the 1.59 million results generated for Campbell Newman? What about the 78,200 results for Jeff Seeney?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151058"></A>
What if getting a job were based on the least number of hits generated? Think about this: if you had to do a Google search on all of your applicants for all of your jobs and you had to cost out going through their Google searches and employing people to do that, then you would end up employing the person who had the least number of hits. So every time Ros Bates, Campbell Newman, Jeff Seeney and Lawrence Springborg went for a job, you would employ Lawrence because Lawrence has only 69,200 hits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151060"></A>
The key question is this: how will they fund this policy? How many extra staff will they need to do these Google searches? There are 200,000 state government employees. If we are going to Google search all of them and only one gets 5.7 million hits--that is, Rosslyn Bates--how are we going to afford this policy to check whether we should employ that person or not? This is an absurd policy; it is absolutely absurd. The shadow minister came out with a public release that said there should be a check box for Google hits and Facebook hits--and I have not even started on Facebook--for every government employee. It is absurd. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151063"></A>
Not only that, I can assure the House that if you check the number of hits for Rosslyn Bates--which was 5.7 million this morning--it will be a different figure tomorrow and it will be a different figure the day after. The problem with using Google hits as an employment tool is that they change all of the time. The internet changes every second. Also, every member in this House should be aware that if you Google your own name you will find a story there that is not true, you will find a story there that is made up, and you will find a story there that is anecdotal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151066"></A>
The problem with the shadow minister’s policy is that it would be the most unfair employment policy that we have ever seen. We would have people applying for jobs and we would have people employed to search through the millions of hits that their names show just to make sure they had seen them all. Then by the time they had got through the 5.8 million hits, they would have to do the other couple of hundred thousand hits that had happened in the 12 months it had taken to look through those 5.7 million hits. That is the policy of the opposition. It is an uncosted policy. It is an absurd policy. It is a ridiculous policy. I look forward to them costing that in the election campaign. Mr Deputy Speaker, I now seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151067"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Has your speech been to the Speaker’s office? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151068"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Indeed it has. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151069"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Is leave granted? </Hansard-Body>

The Budget includes $30 million to create 10 new multi-purpose cyclone shelters throughout North Queensland. The Department of Public Works will manage the delivery of these facilities in communities including Cairns, Townsville, Cassowary Coast, Proserpine/Airlie Beach, Yeppoon/Rockhampton and Weipa.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151072"></A>
The Premier announced this week that a new State High School to be built on Mackay’s Northern Beaches will house one of the new shelters. It will be built to withstand a Category 5 cyclone and is scheduled for completion when the new school opens in 2013.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151073"></A>
This shelter and the others to be built throughout the State have the potential to save lives. It will be debris-protected, fitted with toilet and shower facilities, contain storage space for emergency bedding, fresh water and non-perishable food and will have adjoining emergency helicopter landing access.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151074"></A>
An expert panel determined this to be the best available site for a public cyclone shelter in the Mackay region. The site is deemed to be outside of potential storm tide inundation and above a 1-in-500-year flood event, and not at risk from landslip or other significant hazards. In times where there is no cyclone activity, the building will not be idle. It will be a community facility designed for multi-functional use by the school and local community groups. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Managing growth and tackling congestion are one of the key priorities in the State Budget. That’s why it includes $53.8 million for initiatives to tackle congestion and reduce pressure on Brisbane’s CBD. These funds will go towards delivering:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151076"></A>
Refurbishment of existing buildings at the former QUT campus at Carseldine to house 1,000 government workers by late 2012;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151077"></A>
A new State Government Building in Bowen Hills for the relocation of approximately 2400 State Government workers in 2014; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151078"></A>
15,000 square metres of office space to accommodate 1200 State Government workers in the Ipswich CBD by 2014.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151079"></A>
The Budget will also help to deliver a major rejuvenation of the Townsville CBD, with a new State Government building set to breathe fresh life into Queensland’s second capital. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151080"></A>
There’s also good news for Cairns and the Far North, with a $38 million funding package to revitalise the city heart--and $6.3 million to refurbish the Cairns Convention Centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151081"></A>
The State Government has a massive $15 billion capital works program which is generating jobs, investment and delivering vital infrastructure throughout the State. Once again, this is a key focus of the State Budget, with the Department of Public Works managing the delivery of major projects including:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151082"></A>
The $1.76 billion Gold Coast University Hospital;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151083"></A>
The $1.4 billion Queensland Children’s Hospital:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151084"></A>
Major hospital redevelopments in Ipswich, Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The $570 million Supreme Court and District Court complex in Brisbane’s CBD; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151086"></A>
$8 million over two years to upgrade facilities on the Rockhampton riverbank.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151087"></A>
The Budget also continues Labor’s strong investment in information and communication technology. Over the last three years the State Government has increased its ICT spend from $1.4 billion in 2008-09 to a projected $1.6 billion in 2011-12.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151088"></A>
The State Government’s primary technology service provider CITEC will continue to invest in ICT infrastructure, with a $22.7 million capital expenditure budget in 2011-12. This will allow CITEC to continue with its program of data centre consolidation, network and infrastructure improvement.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151089"></A>
Our ICT spend is spread far and wide across government. It will deliver improvements to frontline services in our schools, hospitals, and police, fire and ambulance services. The budget includes:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151090"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151093"></A>
a Computer Aided Dispatch system;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151094"></A>
upgrading existing resources through technology refresh; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151095"></A>
the Digital Integrated Traffic Camera System.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151096"></A>
$20 million for the Computers for Teachers program;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1151097"></A>
Funding to provide more than 64,000 additional computers to Queensland state school students in Years 9 to 12 under the Australian Government’s Digital Education Revolution; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151098"></A>
$13.5 million over four years for GPS technology to monitor dangerous sex offenders in the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151099"></A>
Coming back to the electorate I represent, in addition to the Community Centre in Yeronga the State Budget also includes funding to strengthen community services in Yeerongpilly, including:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151100"></A>
$1.32 million for autism early intervention initiatives</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151101"></A>
$954,000 for home and community care services; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151102"></A>
$931,000 to for services to tackle domestic and family violence;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151103"></A>
The Budget also delivers a significant boost to the local transport and main roads network. Residents will enjoy the benefits of $5.66 million boost to continue busway maintenance at various locations on the South East Busway running between Woolloongabba and Springwood. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151104"></A>
This is all about ensuring our busways remain in tip-top condition to encourage public transport use and take the pressure off our increasingly busy roads.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151105"></A>
Other new funding includes:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151106"></A>
$960,000 to complete road traffic noise treatments between Mains Road and Omeo Street, Nathan Connection Arterial Road, Macgregor</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151107"></A>
$475,000 to complete remedial surface treatments at the Klumpp Road intersection on Mains Road Upper Mount Gravatt at a total cost of $625,000; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151108"></A>
$83,000 for passenger set-down facilities at Moorooka State School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151109"></A>
The Budget also delivers a boost to early childhood education. It includes a $279,000 boost for approved kindergarten programs for children in the year prior to Prep.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151110"></A>
Yeronga-based company EM Solutions has also secured State Government support through the Budget. It’s been awarded $250,000 in the latest round of Business and Industry Transformation Incentives Scheme funding, to develop a technology that could enhance the National Broadband Network service in regional communities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151111"></A>
EM Solutions will use the funding to build on their existing microwave technology to create a new product that will have the potential to become a vital component of the NBN infrastructure. This technology will be able to carry the network traffic at high speeds from the optical cable to regional and remote areas using high-capacity technology. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151112"></A>
And this brings me to the rollout of the NBN here in Queensland, Mr Speaker.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151113"></A>
It’s full steam ahead with the NBN in Queensland. This is the biggest infrastructure project in our nation’s history bringing $9 billion worth of investment 5,500 jobs to Queensland during construction.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151114"></A>
NBN’s first stage roll out is underway in Townsville and they’ve announced second phase sites including Toowoomba, Springfield and Brisbane North.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151115"></A>
Recently we appointed an NBN Development Officer in Townsville to work with businesses and local government to maximise the opportunities for the digital economy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151116"></A>
Labor supports the NBN and we want every Queensland home, business, school, hospital and emergency service to have access to fast broadband.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151117"></A>
The opportunities for improved service delivery, business development and education through the NBN are enormous.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151118"></A>
This budget charts a course for the future with the aim of bringing renewed prosperity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1151119"></A>
There is a lot to be excited about as we come out of the global financial crisis and Queensland enters a new era of growth. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_211630" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (9.16 pm): It is my pleasure to rise and speak in the cognate debate on these bills, including the Appropriation Bill. Budgets define governments--that is what the Premier said this week--and I will tell the House how Labor will always be defined: waste, debt, deficit, taxes and empty promises. Let me tell the House how this Bligh Labor government will be defined by the budget handed down this week by the honourable member for Mount Coot-tha, the Treasurer. </A></Hansard-Body>

Honourable members may recall last month that American evangelist Harold Camping--who has predicted the end of the world not once but twice--was so confident of his prediction of the coming rapture, the supposed end of the world, that he even nominated a date, and as we all know his predictions proved well short of the mark. The member for Mount Coot-tha is Queensland’s political equivalent of Harold Camping--an economic evangelist, a cult leader whose soaring rhetoric continually predicts growth and better times but whose predictions continually fall well short of the mark. The Treasurer’s mantra to the people of Queensland is ‘Do without now and the good times will inevitably follow’--the classic mark of the cargo cult or, in this case, the ALP government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151130"></A>
According to the Treasurer’s economic rapture, Queensland’s economic growth in 2009-10 was predicted to be three per cent. The cold reality was 2.1 per cent. In 2010-11, the Treasurer--channelling Harold Camping--predicted 3 per cent growth. What was the cold reality? Zero per cent. This is the worst recorded level in 30 years. Undeterred, just like Harold Camping, this year the Treasurer has now upped the ante and predicted five per cent. It is like waking up on a Sunday morning and watching that channel, isn’t it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151131"></A>
Queensland’s economy was already struggling before it was delivered a king-hit by floods and cyclones. State final demand figures for Queensland showed only 1.2 per cent growth for the year ended 31 March, with a contraction of 0.6 per cent in the March quarter. It was patently obvious that we were never going to achieve the Treasurer’s prediction of 3 per cent for the 2010-11 budget--it will now end up at zero per cent. Transfer duty transaction numbers were already in decline in the December quarter year on year for all regions, as I pointed out in a speech I made in the Mackay parliamentary sittings--thanks to the honourable shadow Treasurer’s weekly economic report which I consume with interest, and I will refer to it a little later in my speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158085"></A>
As I listened to the Treasurer’s budget speech, it was once again brought home to me just how out of touch he is with reality. This Treasurer has been pulling Queensland’s economic levers for four years, for four budgets. Under his economic vision, his economic leadership, his economic incompetence, business related bankruptcies in Queensland under the Bankruptcy Act in the March quarter represented more than a third of the total throughout Australia--one-third, or 364 out of the national total of 1,080. That is more than in New South Wales and more than Victoria, both of which have just removed economically inept Labor governments. What does the Treasurer have to say about economic conditions on the Gold Coast? He shrugs them off by saying--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158097"></A>
There is no mention of the various evolutions of the Integrated Planning Act and the Sustainable Planning Act that have made life so uncertain for businesses, developers and even the council to plan for some certainty for the future. Labor’s failed economic management has forced more than 4,000 workers and their families to leave the Gold Coast, and everywhere one looks there are empty businesses and ‘for sale’ or ‘for lease’ signs on business premises, on houses and on units.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hear the member for Gaven echoing those sentiments. Whether it is the urbanised area of the Gold Coast or the areas that are slightly more regional on the Gold Coast, that is the story throughout the Gold Coast. Retail trade is in the doldrums--the inevitable result of this Labor government’s policies that have emptied people’s pockets by ratcheting up the prices of water, electricity, rates, car registration, licences and petrol. </Hansard-Body>

Thanks to this Labor government’s economic incompetence, Queensland is nearly now at the point of having reverse migration--fewer people arriving from the southern states than are leaving. ABS statistics showed a 40 per cent fall in interstate migration to Queensland in the September quarter last year, notwithstanding the Treasurer’s prediction, as we saw in the budget on Tuesday, that they will soon suddenly return. This Labor government’s policies have nullified many of the advantages which made Queensland the preferred place to live for many Australians. At the moment we have to rely on overseas migration and births exceeding deaths to boost our population.</Hansard-Body>

But what opportunities are there for Queenslanders under this Bligh Labor government and who believes its predictions? This week, having heard the prediction of 140,000 jobs promised in the budget, Griffith University economist Professor Makin has questioned that particular promise. We all remember the 100,000 bread-winning jobs promised by the Premier and her Treasurer at the last election. What happened to them? We all know it turned out that that forecast included jobs that offered as little as one hour employment a week. That is hardly crumb-winning let alone bread-winning! The slowdown in interstate migration will last as long as people have diminished confidence in Queensland’s economic performance. That confidence does not come back overnight. It will need a change of government to rebuild consumer and workplace confidence, and that could take from three to four years according to some demographers.</Hansard-Body>

The people of the Gold Coast do not need the Treasurer’s gratuitous advice that we should become a fly-in fly-out centre for the mining boom or that we should sell ourselves better and what we have to offer on the Gold Coast, or that we should get rid of the Gold Coast City Council as an answer to the woes besetting the Gold Coast. The people of the Gold Coast do not want this Labor government to turn its back on them as it has done with no cabinet minister from the Gold Coast. Even the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 on 20 April described Treasurer Fraser as ‘all talk and limited action’. The people of the Gold Coast want action--not words, which is all they get from this tired Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

We do not want our seriously ill patients turned away from the Gold Coast Hospital, as 300 have been told over the past 12 months, and told to go somewhere else because hospital waiting lists are too long. Our building and construction industry needs help, not more taxes. This year from January to April there were a total of 253 residential and building projects started on the Gold Coast. Compare that with 1,714 the year before and 2,290 in 2008. In fact, in April there were 15 projects started in residential and commercial building projects. My point is that the government is responsible for setting the conditions in our economy that lead to a reflection in business having the confidence to know that they are going to sell their projects and be able to develop them. But under this Labor government we had all of those charges--the raft of charges that have increased--that have diminished business confidence so much that we can see our business and construction industry absolutely decimated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158122"></A>
It is proof when we look at the economic figures that are provided by the library every week. Building approvals nationally declined by 14.1 per cent over the 12 months to March 2011, but for the same period in Queensland under this Labor government the decline was a staggering 38.1 per cent. Housing finance nationally over the year to March 2011 declined by 1.8 per cent. In the same period Queensland recorded a 17.5 per cent decline in the trend value of housing finance commitments. I ask: what was Treasurer Andrew Fraser’s solution to this decline? He increased stamp duty by 125 per cent on an average priced family home, which will be a real help to the building industry. It is the equivalent of a $7,000 tax on average homes that people are going to have to pay--another tax by stealth as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. Along the way he demeaned car salesmen and real estate salesmen. He was not quite as dismissive at the REIQ dinner last year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158126"></A>
To back up his rapturous predictions on economic growth, in the budget papers the Treasurer has produced a pretty graph. I note that the Leader of the Opposition in his contribution yesterday pointed out some of these graphs and pictures in the budget papers that honestly defy belief and which try to demonstrate that this budget position is better than it was going to be or is going to be better in the future because of the predictions of the Treasurer. This pretty graph shows Queensland as the No. 1 state for predicted economic growth--predicted growth, not actual growth. This budget, the Treasurer assured us, ‘puts us right back where we belong out in front’. This is classic evangelism--classic Harold Camping-ism: ignore all your failed previous predictions and just make a new one. Never mind that people who really know what they are talking about when it comes to economic assessments and predictions, such as leading economists in the major banks, have all placed Queensland’s economic performance in last place, at the bottom, behind all of the other states.</Hansard-Body>

It saddens and disappoints me to listen to the Treasurer boast about Queensland being a magic place--a place of optimism and opportunity--as though only Labor can provide that optimism and opportunity. It saddens and disappoints me when the stark reality is very different, particularly for the tens of thousands of Queenslanders whose concerns the Treasurer dismisses. It saddens and disappoints me for the thousands of Queenslanders who have to fill out business activity statements in a few weeks, at the end of the financial year, and whose economic hardship has been created by him and the government led by the Premier, the member for South Brisbane. It also saddens and disappoints me for the thousands of Queenslanders, many on fixed incomes--pensioners, concession card holders, part-time assistant electorate officers--who are suffering through rising costs of necessities like water, electricity, rates, grocery prices, car registration, increased fuel costs and licences, who have been ignored and abandoned by this Treasurer, who gives with one hand and takes away with the other. It is always more take than give.</Hansard-Body>

As shadow minister for police, corrective services and emergency services and a resident of the Gold Coast, I want to take a moment to honour the late Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding, who tragically lost his life on 1 June. I know that other members have acknowledged it this week; it is my first opportunity to do so. He was grievously injured while serving the people of Queensland whilst responding to a 000 call the previous Sunday evening. I want to pay my deepest respects to his wife, Sonya, and their children, Hudson and Grace. I understand that the fund set up by the Police Union has raised in excess of $540,000, and I urge all Queenslanders to keep his family in their thoughts long into future, and this applies especially once the media focus has passed. It will be a very difficult time for the family. I know that the Police Service is determined to support Sonya and the family. Along with other members, I also was privileged to attend the public memorial service for Damian Leeding which was a remarkable statement of support--unprecedented on the Gold Coast and perhaps even in the whole state--by the community for all of the dedicated members of the Queensland Police Service. We owe them all a very deep gratitude. It also showed the remarkable determination of the community to claim back their city from the criminals who are plaguing it in different areas.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1164623"></A>
In terms of my shadow responsibilities for police, as other members have mentioned, the Queensland Police Union has described this as the worst budget for police resourcing for 20 years. It simply proves that this Bligh Labor government is not serious about tackling crime and is not serious about preventing crime. It is not serious about solving crime and it is definitely not serious about dealing with offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164630"></A>
The minister talks about a reduction in crime rates and all of us hear that every morning in question time. Queenslanders do not believe him. The minister does not talk about the number of crimes committed, which are increasing, or those who will not report crimes. Because clean-up rates are so low, people figure that they might as well not bother. Queenslanders’ perception is that we are not safer. This year, over 80 violent robberies on the Gold Coast and in Coomera have left Gold Coasters and Queenslanders fearful and it has cost a policeman his life. </Hansard-Body>

What does it take to make this Labor government wake up and act? It takes the LNP, a spate of armed robberies and a wave of community anger. Campbell Newman announced that the LNP would establish a serious crime task force--a proposal the Bligh Labor government rejected out of hand. It took this wave of community anger following the tragic events for the minister and the Premier to scurry to set up Task Force Resolve, just as the LNP had said previously it would do. The LNP is listening to the people of Queensland. The ALP is governing for itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158181"></A>
The LNP also proposed GPS tracking to monitor serious child sex offenders and paedophiles. Labor dismissed the idea out hand. They said that it was unaffordable and impractical. So they ruled it out. It took pressure from the LNP, the community and the media to force the Labor government to change its mind and it followed, rather than led, and announced that serious sex offenders would be monitored. This desperate Premier could not wait for the budget; she had to announce the GPS tracking for serious child sex offenders to get the negative comments out of the media and off the front page of the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. Once again, this tired Labor government is not governing for the people of Queensland, just governing for itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158182"></A>
In Corrective Services, in 12 months under this government the cost of running Queensland’s prison system has blown out by $66 million. The cause of this blow-out is certainly not an increase in prisoner numbers under this government’s weak sentencing laws. It certainly has not blown out due to more staff, because Labor has cut front-line custodial staff by 38. It is another example of this tired Labor government’s inefficient management of Queensland’s resources and its preference for bloated bureaucracies as well as being out of touch with underresourced front-line staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158183"></A>
At a time when violent crime is also on the rise, the Bligh Labor government has also reneged on its promise of 200 additional police per year. It has cut back the numbers to just 150. The excuse the government has offered for this cut is apparently it recruited ‘too many new police last year.’ Not one person I have listened to believes that we had too many police last financial year. Even Peter Beattie managed to induct 300 police per year. I remind members that this recruitment is for a workforce that is getting now to 10,600. One-hundred and fifty recruits will really not keep up with the losses that we experience from the Police Service. But despite all the rapturous promises of this Labor government, following on from Peter Beattie who inducted 300 recruits a year, it has managed to halve that number. When it comes to police numbers, Queensland has been short-changed by Labor. Once again, with this long-term Labor government reality fails to match the rhetoric. To reduce police numbers by 25 per cent is nothing short of disgraceful. It is a political betrayal of our already underresourced, hardworking, loyal, front-line police. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158184"></A>
It is interesting to note that not one police station upgrade or refurbishment scheduled in this budget is to occur in an LNP electorate. On the Gold Coast, the Bligh government has committed to a much needed police beat at Burleigh Heads. In an unsurprising sleight of hand, the government has simply robbed the Burleigh Heads CIB refurbishment project of the $2 million committed that was in last year’s budget and changed it to $500,000. Carina gets $2.6 million for a demountable police station to service a community of thousands, whilst Lockhart River in Far North Queensland gets $9 million for a complex to serve far fewer people than that. I have no argument that Lockhart River needs appropriate police facilities and that it is expensive to build in areas like Lockhart River. But when a remote location gets 3 times the allocation and we have already ascertained that the Carina Police Station is going to be a demountable, replacing two other police stations on the east side of Brisbane, there are questions that need to be asked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158185"></A>
The Queensland Ambulance Service has also been poorly served by this budget. The spending on the Queensland Ambulance Service has blown out by nearly eight per cent, yet it delivers only an additional 53 staff. Of course, we have canvassed many times that whilst the ambulance levy is going, that is also a cost that should never have been put on people in the first place. Now, it is going to be replaced with those extra charges--up to $900 that families are paying in all the other costs that they are wearing, including in electricity and water. There is nothing in this budget for overstretched front-line ambulance officers who are forced to ramp ambulances for hours at hospitals. People must be left wondering and scratching their heads where all the money has gone after nine years of paying Labor’s ambulance tax. People might also be forgiven for thinking that electricity bills will now go down now that the ambulance tax is no longer going to appear. But we all know that that is not going to happen. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh Labor government’s budget is big on spending for little result. It shows all the sociopathic hallmarks of an insular, rigid, disconnected, pretentious, domineering, presumptuous, hateful and aggressive Labor government. I contrast that description with the open-minded flexible, caring, compassionate, patient and authentic alternative, a Campbell Newman LNP government. Queensland is fed up with the deceit of a tired Labor government that is addicted to debt and deficit, waste and more taxes. The Treasurer, who is big on rhetoric, confidently announced that the Queensland budget is marching on to surplus--not once, but twice--among the soaring rapture of his budget rhetoric. Let us look at the facts: this year’s deficit is $2.13 billion. Next year--2001-12--there is a $4 billion deficit. Then there is a $1.3 billion deficit, an $873 million deficit and a $529 million deficit in 2014-15. There is nothing about marching to surplus there. It is deficit after deficit. We cannot believe a word the Treasurer says, except that his predictions are predictably incorrect and that he will invariably blame someone else for his incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158187"></A>
The Treasurer, Labor and the Premier have no debt repayment strategy, a fire sale of assets, which cannot keep up with the interest payments on the debt it has accumulated, and a reliance on Queensland’s revenue getting up to $80 billion, which could take a generation--and that is presuming debt does not increase even more--to try to get back Queensland’s AAA credit rating. As Queensland enters its 153rd year, we deserve better. This century is ours for the taking, but it is not going to happen while this tired Labor government remains in power. It is time for us to have a change. There is another way. I exhort Queenslanders to make that choice. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_213636" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Coomera--LNP) (9.36 pm): It is worthy that I make a brief overview of this embarrassing budget before I discuss the effect that it will have on the residents of the state seat of Coomera. Firstly, despite the asset sales that were so wrong for Queenslanders and Queensland’s future, debt is increasing. The maximum projected debt is higher than was originally suggested in 2009-10. The interest on that debt will be $595,000 per hour, or $100 million a week. Just imagine what could be bought for that amount every week. This year, the deficit will be $2.127 billion and it will jump to more than $4 billion for the year 2011-12. The removal of the ambulance levy of $113, although welcomed--as I know that this side of the House has opposed this tax for years--will only offset the electricity price rises of around $120. These increases are on top of a $700 increase since 2006. This levy and the electricity price rise have a proportionately bigger impact on lower income earners. </A></Hansard-Body>

The abolition of the principal place of residence concession for homeowners buying established houses and units will severely impact on an already struggling real estate market. As I said, this is an embarrassment for the Treasurer and this tired old Labor government and it is a disappointment for the people of Queensland in that the budget does not deliver the reform that is needed to help ease cost-of-living pressures. Let us not forget that we are still paying more for fuel, electricity, car registration and water. Electricity prices will continue to increase, car registrations will continue to increase, fuel costs are still rising and other government imposed taxes and charges continue to rise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158196"></A>
I turn now to the specific impact that this disappointing budget will have on the residents of the state seat of Coomera. From Eagleby in the north to Helensvale in the south, this budget will have a severe impact on the residents of my electorate. Of course, the same can be said for many other Gold Coast residents. But it does not help to know that the pain is being shared by many. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158197"></A>
In the area of health, I constantly receive complaints from constituents who are suffering severe pain whilst they are stuck on the waiting list. We hear now that many have been knocked back to even get on the waiting list. Granted, the Gold Coast University Hospital at Robina will be coming on line, but my fear is that by the time it does open, waiting lists will have blown out even further and there will be too little, too late, to redress the problem properly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158199"></A>
Labor has failed to properly plan for the future and my residents ultimately pay the price. The $2.5 million allocated to complete a new temporary ambulance station at Coomera is welcomed. It is one that is desperately needed to fill the void between the Beenleigh station, which is at Eagleby at the extreme north of my electorate, and Helensvale station, which is in the extreme south of my electorate. Those two stations are around 32 kilometres apart, so the Coomera station is a welcome addition. I note that we have a unit based at the QAS training facility at Pimpama as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164882"></A>
The major issue, though, is the ramping that occurs. I received credible information just the other day to say that a particular ambulance had been ramped at one of the hospitals from 12.30 pm and was still there, along with 10 others, at 5 pm. How much longer are we going to waste these resources, these highly skilled paramedics? We have to resolve the emergency department crisis in our hospitals. </Hansard-Body>

Looking now at public transport, fares increased 20 per cent last year and will increase 15 per cent this year and 15 per cent each year until 2014-15. These fare hikes are unfair. When you consider that the residents of the Coomera electorate catch trains from the most northerly stations on the Gold Coast line--Helensvale, Coomera, Ormeau and Beenleigh--it is unfair to ask them to pay these price rises without getting commensurate increases in services. What I am talking about is the right to have a seat for the more-than-one-hour ride to the city. That is the service they want--a seat. Many of them do not get one. They are sick of it. Many of them are walking away from the train service and instead commuting by car. This is counter to what we are trying to achieve. This government is seeking to increase public transport use to more than double what it is today on the Gold Coast. I have a tip for the Treasurer and the transport minister: they are not going to achieve this goal by forcing people to stand for an hour each way to and from work on the ‘Bombay Express’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164886"></A>
The announcement of a review of timetables for the Gold Coast line is welcome, but unless I have missed it there is no allocation for a review of the bus timetables. That project was shelved more than a year ago because there was not any money. We need a fully reviewed public transport network in the northern Gold Coast region to accommodate the explosion in population that continues to date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164887"></A>
In education we see funding for the ongoing planning of a new Coomera secondary school on land adjacent to the newly opened Gold Coast TAFE campus. This is welcome, as is the allocation of funding to expand Coomera Springs State School and Ormeau Wood State School. It is also worth noting that we have the new Lords School entering the first stages of construction and the new Mother Teresa Catholic Primary School that opened this year. These new schools and the additional funding allocated for kindergartens at Coomera Springs State School, Coomera State School, Eagleby State School and also funding for the kindy at the Lords School are testament to the population growth in the Coomera electorate. Why, then, are we not seeing investment in transport infrastructure commensurate with that growth? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164891"></A>
It also puts a question mark over the budgeted staff increase of less than one per cent--just 251 teachers. If the growth in my electorate is being repeated elsewhere, that will not keep up with the pace of ordinary enrolments. I note that there has been a cut to capital works spending. However, the spend is still relatively sizeable, further casting doubt over the prudence of the small increase in teacher numbers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164892"></A>
Turning to main roads, I was hoping to see some allocation of funding for the duplication of the overpass and other works at exit 54 on the M1. Also there is a desperate need for funding to resolve gridlock at exit 38 during peak periods. Sadly these exits were ignored yet again. Indeed, the division 1 councillor, Donna Gates, has been kind enough to help the department out by allocating $100,000 of her roads budget to a Queensland government owned road to at least try to alleviate a little of the congestion by funding a small slip road. I hope that it works to some degree, but this tired, old Labor government should be ashamed and embarrassed that a council has to allocate scarce dollars, dollars that could have been spent on council controlled roads, because it fails to accept its responsibility on state roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164894"></A>
I wonder about the accuracy of the budget when I see such blatant errors as in the regional budget statement for the Gold Coast which has included $159.7 million in funding towards the $421.6 million upgrade of the Pacific Motorway between Springwood and Daisy Hill. Treasurer, for your information, Springwood and Daisy Hill are many kilometres north of the Logan City-Gold Coast City boundary. Or is this a hint that there are more council amalgamations on the way?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164895"></A>
Housing and housing affordability are of great concern to all of us. The new home grant is likely to give a short-term boost to the housing construction industry. The question is: how long will it last? With unemployment and underemployment in the construction industry at astronomical levels on the northern Gold Coast, I worry that it is just not enough, certainly in terms of the length of time it is being made available, to make any lasting difference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164896"></A>
The other concern I have--and I have had discussions with longstanding members of the real estate industry--is: what will the impact of the hike in stamp duty be on people buying property that is not new? The evidence suggests that the majority of sales in my electorate--that is, from Eagleby, which is in the southern part of Logan City on the M1, down to Helensvale--are distressed sales. I need to clarify what I mean by ‘distressed sales’. I am not just talking about mortgagee sales; I am also referring to sales brought on by marriage and relationship breakdown. People who are hurting financially due to a downturn in their economic situation often come under stress in their relationship as well. These people are the ones who will be hurt the most by this increase in stamp duty. They can ill afford to discount their property further to take account of the increased burden on the buyer to find the additional stamp duty. The Treasurer is hurting the wrong people. They are already doing it tough and he is putting the boot into them. It could be the nail in the coffin for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164897"></A>
In turn, the Treasurer is also hurting the real estate industry. Remember, these people are already experiencing the worst period in their memory. This added burden is once again, for many of them, a nail in their coffin. As for mortgagee sales, I am told there are 20,000 call-ups a year for people to show cause to the bank why they should not have their property sold out from under them. Yet again, this is a nail in their coffin.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164898"></A>
Many of the properties on the market today were bought at inflated prices. I am told that prices are down by as much as 30 per cent in my area, not the three per cent or four per cent that is touted as an average. We have a distressed rental market, with many tenants behind in their rent through no fault of their own. This once again puts pressure on landlords who have to pay the bank interest regardless of whether the rent has been paid or not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164899"></A>
Cost-of-living increases are crippling those who can least afford it. I mentioned earlier the offset of the ambulance levy against the expected increase in electricity prices. It is not a win for people. It is not more money in their pocket. It is an offset. Once again, coupled with wholesale water price hikes and the many other increased costs of living, many Coomera electorate residents will be on the brink.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164900"></A>
Before I turn to the issue of police and policing, I would like to place on the parliamentary record my condolences and the condolences of those people of the state seat of Coomera to the family of Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding: to his wife, Sonya, his children, little Hudson and baby Grace, and his parents, siblings, and extended family. As I am sure all members know, Damian was a officer based at the Coomera Police Station in the Coomera electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164902"></A>
Police and policing is the most important issue in my electorate. I note that spending on major capital is down while overall costs have blown out. Beenleigh is a town centre that services the Waterford, Albert and northern Coomera electorates. The residents of this region are some of the greatest victims of Labor’s mismanagement. The cost of the refurbishment of the Beenleigh Police Station has blown out by more than $4.15 million in just one year. I joined with the member for Albert in lobbying for a new police station for the Ormeau area. This area is fast growing and is around halfway between Beenleigh Police Station and Coomera Police Station. There is almost 20 kilometres of M1 between Beenleigh and Coomera stations and that is just too far. Police need to be able to close that gap. But what chance have we got when we see blowouts in budgets like that of Beenleigh Police Station? This government is incapable of financial management. The only chance we have to rein in spending is for Queensland voters to vote this tired, old Labor government out at the next election. Bring on an election now, Premier, and let us get on the road to recovery for the sake of my constituents and all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164903"></A>
In light of the unlikely outcome of a new police station, let me talk now about what we need with current infrastructure in place. We heard earlier this week that the Coomera Police District has one officer for more than 1,100 residents. This compares with a state average of one officer for around 450 residents. In short, we need more blue shirts on the streets in the Coomera division--more blue shirts to dissuade potential crooks and more cars on the road--but before that we need a tactical crime squad. We have the room for them in the new district headquarters. At the moment our current police are simply going from job to job. There is no time to be proactive. In fact, they are not even getting to all the calls. Something like a third of calls are not serviced. There is a very good reason for this. Coomera has around 20 per cent of calls and around 10 to 15 per cent of resources. Do the numbers. That is about two-thirds of the resources needed to service the calls. </Hansard-Body>

My understanding is that a tactical crime squad is not funded in the normal way: through growth. It is my understanding that a tactical crime squad is funded and formed through a one-off staffing allocation. We have the room for them at Coomera. We need this government to have the resolve to give Coomera a tactical crime squad. These squads are proactive. They are out there and moving ahead of the criminals. We need that squad. People are sick to death of what is going on in their backyard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173723"></A>
Once we have the squad in place, we need to play catch-up with the growth equation. We need more blue shirts and more cars on the road to catch up with the callouts we are not doing and to be seen on the streets by the criminals, to deter them. They know when the shift changes happen, when the officers are doing their paperwork at the end of a shift and getting equipment ready at the beginning of a shift. That is when, as a percentage, a far greater number of crimes are committed. We need overlapping shifts such as the Queensland Ambulance Service has, so we have people on the road at all times.</Hansard-Body>

Finally, I turn to small business. In the Coomera electorate, small businesses are hurting. I have already mentioned real estate agents and tradies in the building industry. Members should be assured that small business, the backbone of our economy, is suffering. As an example, the bigger boat builders, many of which are in my electorate, are supported by many small business people renting their premises in the Coomera marine precinct and Horizon Shores marine precinct. I have personal knowledge of the difficulties being experienced, as well as information from others that confirms my understanding of how tough they are doing it. I mentioned earlier that residential tenants are doing it tough, which has a knock-on affect to landlords. The same is the case in the marine industry. Many cannot pay the rent. The impact is that, if evicted, they go on the dole line or move away from this vital industry, which is so important to the local economy. If they move away from the industry, that further affects the likelihood of a recovery in the industry. In turn, we potentially see those sheds left empty, unsuitable for most other industrial uses. This is just an example of the difficult time small business is having.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173728"></A>
On the subject of the marine industry, I need to bring to the attention of the House the plight of a local company that has been a cornerstone of the marine industry on the Gold Coast. Indeed, Gold Coast City Marina is the developer of the largest commercial marina in the southern hemisphere. I am proud to say that Gold Coast City Marina is based in the Coomera electorate, in the precinct behind Dreamworld. Gold Coast City Marina has worked with Australian based Leighton Contractors and others, under the name Deep Blue Consortium, to develop a bid for a vacant parcel of land on The Spit. Deep Blue Consortium is the only consortium to bring to the government a fully developed bid for the development of that parcel of land. It has spent in excess of $2 million and thousands of hours to prepare the bid. When other bidders dropped out of the process, this government encouraged Deep Blue Consortium to continue in the process. Had they stopped at that point, they could have saved tens of thousands of dollars of expense and many hours of effort. The government encouraged them to continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173731"></A>
On presentation of the completed bid document, the production cost of which was valued at many thousands of dollars, the government rejected the bid outright. The government then called for new expressions of interest at short notice. Deep Blue Consortium confirmed their interest in the process. I am told that, without further discussion, Deep Blue Consortium found out from a media story that it was unsuccessful and that Canada based Brookfield Multiplex is the front runner. Brookfield Multiplex had not been in previous bid processes. According to media reports, the Treasurer has said that the deal with the contractor could be finalised by late this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173732"></A>
A number of concerns arise out of what has transpired. First of all, why was the original process abandoned without further discussion to resolve any issues? Why did the government not afford Deep Blue Consortium the courtesy of advising them that they were unsuccessful? Why was Deep Blue Consortium, with its previous track record, not included in the latest project bid? After all, it has a very good understanding of the site and what can be achieved. How is it that the Treasurer believes that the whole thing is a done deal before even receiving the completed bid from Brookfield Multiplex? Indeed, how is it that a group can be handed the project with no previous involvement? The suggestion is that something untoward is going on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173733"></A>
Brookfield Multiplex, from a standing start, within less than a three-month time frame, is going to pull together a detailed bid for an $800 million, or thereabouts, project that the Treasurer believes will be a done deal within months of that time. Has the Treasurer authorised the department to leak or otherwise provide Deep Blue Consortium’s intellectual property and/or its list of consultants to this new preferred bidder, to enable it to do what it needs to do in such a short time? If not, how is it that Deep Blue Consortium has been advised by its consultant that it has been contacted by Brookfield Multiplex asking for information about Deep Blue Consortium’s bid?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. The imputations that are being put forward by the member for Coomera not only are totally unsubstantiated and being made up on the spot, but also they are deeply offensive and I ask for them to be withdrawn. More to the point, if he has any information to go towards the point he is making, he should immediately provide it to the CMC rather than make the point in here.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173735"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Mr Elmes): I do not know that there is a point of order, but certainly the Treasurer finds the comments you made offensive. You will withdraw.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173736"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. How did Brookfield Multiplex know who the consultants were if not told by the government? Can the Treasurer give a guarantee that no-one has provided this information to the preferred bidder and also guarantee that it will not be provided? I further call on the Treasurer to reopen the bidding process to give a well respected local business with Australian based partners at the very least a chance to provide an alternative to the Brookfield Multiplex bid. If successful, this local consortium, which has a wealth of knowledge in this type of construction, would be using local people that desperately need a shot in the arm. This could be the start of a revitalisation of the local marine industry, giving confidence to those in the industry to hang in and be part of the revitalisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173737"></A>
I repeat that this budget is an embarrassment for the Treasurer and the government. It is a budget that has delivered little joy to the people of the Coomera electorate. </Hansard-Body>

We have lived through a summer of disasters, with floods, cyclones and torrential rain that has ruined homes, businesses, roads, infrastructure, holidays and the tourism industry as well. This budget is about rebuilding Queensland. It is a budget that cares for those who have suffered and it is a budget that helps families with the cost of living. </A></Hansard-Body>

This budget seeks to abolish the ambulance levy, which will save Queensland families and small business $113 on their electricity bills. It also includes a boost to the home construction industry by providing a $10,000 grant for all Queenslanders constructing or purchasing a new home up to the value of $600,000, with first home buyers also eligible for the $7,000 first home buyers grant. The ClimateSmart program will be extended for two years, meaning potential savings of $480 on household electricity bills. I have had this service done and it is very valuable in teaching you to change your habits and save money. I highly recommend everyone to take up this opportunity. Further to the need to reduce cost-of-living pressures on our older community members, we have a concessions pack that includes big increases per year to important rebates, including electricity rebates of up to $230, pensioner rates rebates up to $200 and a SEQ water subsidy of $120. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173745"></A>
We will invest for the future, with the move of Year 7 into high school funded in this budget, along with the extension of the 125 per cent payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees and further investment in research and innovation through a $100 million allocation from the Future Growth Fund. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173746"></A>
I have lobbied for funds for my electorate and this budget delivers on that work. As members would know, the northbound AJ Wyllie Bridge at Petrie was wrecked during the January floods. I am pleased that our main roads minister has stepped in to ensure that funding of $16 million is incorporated in this budget and will complement the federal disaster relief funding to reconstruct our bridge, which in turn will also improve flood resilience in future weather events. </Hansard-Body>

Locally, the investment of $100,000 to deliver a dedicated diabetes liaison nurse for Pine Rivers’ locals has been well received.

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1173752"></A>
People living with diabetes often need life long care from a wide range of clinicians from their local GP to surgeons and endocrinologists. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1173753"></A>
This is because as well as the day to day management of the illness there can often be complications affecting vision, blood supply and kidney problems. In the past these patients may have had to navigate the complex health system on their own. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1173756"></A>
Around 23,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. For every one person diagnosed with diabetes, up to one other person is undiagnosed. The number of people with diabetes has more than doubled in 15 years with 300,000 Queenslanders now living with type 2 diabetes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1173757"></A>

The 2011-2012 budget is a solid budget that balances the need for government investment in business areas that are currently struggling with the need to help ease cost-of-living pressures for Queenslanders. It has been framed following a devastating year of natural disasters that have impacted harshly on many communities, many businesses and many families, hot on the heals of the global financial crisis. The Queensland budget is on track to reap the benefits of the Bligh government’s careful planning during this difficult year. Treasury has forecast growth of five per cent next year and 5.25 per cent the following year. Government is investing in areas of the economy that are currently struggling, as responsible governments should, with long-term targeted stimulus programs. </A></Hansard-Body>

The home building sector is lagging. So the Queensland Building Boost program has been welcomed by the building industry. Between 1 August 2011 and 31 January 2012, people building a new home valued at up to $600,000 can apply for a $10,000 grant. There is still no stamp duty for first home buyers who purchase a home under $500,000. The abolition of the ambulance levy will help ease cost-of-living issues for those Queenslanders who were paying $113 a year on their electricity bill. Increases in pensioner rebates for electricity, water and rates will also help return more money to the pockets of older residents. </Hansard-Body>

The tourism sector is also struggling following months of natural disasters and weather events in combination with a rising Aussie dollar, and that has come hot on the heels of the global financial crisis impacts. An amount of $85 million will be invested in major events around the state to attract visitors back to our tourism hot spots. Employment is forecast to grow by three per cent next year, meaning 140,000 new Queensland jobs over two years. We are on track to return to surplus in 2015-16. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh Labor government is committed to providing a quality education system which is accessible for all children. I welcome the decision that year 7 will become part of high school from 2015 as part of our A Flying Start for Queensland Children reforms. I look forward to working with school communities to ensure a smooth transition for our students. An extra 300 FTE teacher positions and an extra 5,000 teacher aide hours per week have been included in this budget. I am also excited to see that Bald Hills State School will establish a kindergarten on-site as well as kindergarten programs being provided in long-day-care centres in many suburbs in my electorate. I am also pleased to see a further $5 million in capital works funding alone for the Bracken Ridge TAFE/SkillsTech campus. </Hansard-Body>

The Sandgate electorate is fortunate to be serviced by two railway lines--the Shorncliffe and Caboolture lines--and the bus network. The Shorncliffe line is the oldest passenger line in Brisbane, and the $44 million of work on public transport infrastructure improvement around the south-east is most welcome. We will also be building the extra car-parking spaces at Sandgate station as well as upgrading the platform and providing a lift. Deagon station has started on its rejuvenation and the improvements are already starting to make a difference. I am pleased that my years of lobbying for these transport improvements has paid off. </Hansard-Body>

A record $11 billion Health budget is delivering more services sooner and closer to home. The Brighton health campus is changing shape to meet the demands of our ageing population.

 I thank the member for Sandgate for her interjection. It was truly inspiring to see the outpouring of generosity.

The community of Grantham has a long road to recovery but, thanks to the generosity of Albert residents and the commitment of the Bligh government, they have been given a flying start. The economic costs of these disasters have been outlined by the Treasurer in his budget papers. But taking tough decisions like floating QR, which I admit some of my constituents are still unhappy with, means the state’s balance sheet is in a strong position to take advantage of the enormous economic expansion that Queensland is poised to welcome. I am particularly proud that, despite the personal and fiscal heartache of the destructive floods and Cyclone Yasi, the Labor government of which I am a proud member remains committed to the values of making a difference for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

Despite the negativity of the LNP, easing the cost-of-living pressures by abolishing the $113 ambulance levy and increasing council and electricity rebates and other concessions for pensioners have been widely welcomed by my constituents. In fact, it will be really interesting to see how the LNP votes later tonight on the repeal of the community ambulance cover levy. Its members have a stark choice. Will they vote to cut power bills by $113? If not, they will have to explain to my constituents why they oppose it and why they refuse to provide sensible alternatives to ease cost-of-living pressures. </Hansard-Body>

For the past 10 years my key priorities as the member for Albert have been to work very hard to ensure that my electorate receives new state government infrastructure and services to reflect such a fast-growing region. Not surprisingly, schools, roads, transport and extra police services continue to be my major priorities. Albert has once again done very well indeed in this year’s budget, and I thank the Treasurer and a range of ministers who have endured my lobbying over such a long time on some key projects. </Hansard-Body>

I am delighted that my petitions to the parliament and my many hours of discussions with the Minister for Main Roads and his department have delivered results, with the fast-tracking of the upgrade of traffic lights for the very busy intersection of Beenleigh-Beaudesert Road and Tallagandra Road. The $8 million project is expected to be completed in early 2012. The minister knows that I will also continue to fight for the four-laning of this busy arterial road. </Hansard-Body>

On Thursday the Premier announced, together with the Minister for Education Cameron Dick, that in 2012 Windaroo State School was to receive their own new kindergarten service. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1180676"></A>
I particularly welcome this announcement since our son Joshua Keech was a foundation student at Windaroo State School with our daughter Helen enrolling the following year. And not to be beaten, I was the foundation relief teacher for the school. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1180677"></A>
The announcement of this new kindy for 2012 is in addition to the new kindergartens which have already been announced by the Minister will open at Mt Warren Park State School and Norfolk Village State Schools, Coomera Springs, and Highland Reserve State Schools. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hardworking principals, teachers, chaplains and support staff of all of the schools in Albert who do an outstanding job in giving our children amazing opportunities to realise their potential. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Despite the negativity of those opposite, I welcome the massive stimulus package for the building of new homes. The announcement of the $10,000 grant for a new home or unit contracted between 1 August 2011 and 21 January 2012 is good news for families and for growing employment in Albert. Since Budget day, I am not surprised that because Albert is the first home owners capital of Australia that my electorate office reports that the grants has already caused much interest.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for State Development and Trade) (10.08 pm), in reply: I thank all members for their contribution to the debate. I thank in particular those members of the government for their support of this budget, this budget which does make choices for the future of Queensland. I thank also at the outset the hardworking officers of the Queensland Treasury for their frank advice, for their fearless advice, for their continuing independent and professional advice, and I thank them in particular for their ability to go on continuing to serve, without fear or favour, the people of Queensland. I also quickly thank my own office, who have worked under extraordinary circumstances in the last period of time. I thank all of them for their work, and I give a particular shout out tonight to Sharon and Bob and Claire. We are all still thinking of you very much. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1187645"></A>
This week we presented a budget--a budget for Queensland, a budget that made choices for Queensland, a budget that was an honest document that set out the challenges and the choices, a budget that levelled with the people of Queensland that in budgeting you always have to make the choices between what it is you are going to do, the way you are going to do it and the way you are going to fund it. We set about addressing those issues that are facing Queenslanders regarding the cost of living with the abolition of the ambulance levy, which shortly this parliament will have the opportunity to vote on. The wood will be on all members of parliament as to whether or not they are going to support the measures that fund the abolition of the ambulance levy to save Queenslanders--1.4 million electricity account holders--$113 off their bill next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187646"></A>
This is a budget about enjoining more people, more communities and more industries into the prosperity that is surely ahead for the Queensland economy. It is about providing support to those industries that need it most like tourism and like the housing industry. Mr Speaker, you would think from listening to the opposition over the past two days that there are no tradies in their electorates--there are no builders, no plumbers, no sparkies--and that there are no interior decorators in Moggill anymore because, as far as they are concerned, the $140 million Building Boost program that we have proposed does not earn their support. It deserves their support but it does not earn their support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187648"></A>
Mr Speaker, what you have seen this week is the vision and the capacity of this government, the ability to front up square shouldered and make choices for the future. It stands in stark contrast to the vacuous emptiness of the LNP. Mr Speaker, what you have seen again is acres of nothingness. It is like eating air. It is like drinking gin with nothing else in it. They have barely been able to hold it together. They could not even decide whether or not they would accept fulsomely the challenge to come in here and present their policies to the people of Queensland. In a half-hearted way they managed to come in here and present a couple of pronouncements, not least a policy. But having come in here and decided to present those pronouncements, they could not back it up with anything substantial. As soon as they were asked a question, what happened is that the whole thing fell away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187650"></A>
They came in here with a half-baked effort from the 3IC which amounted to nothing more than verbal vomit. It started off in here all bile and wretchedness, and it moved on from the bile and wretchedness into an episode of hand wringing and chest beating. It was as indolent as it was impotent because, at the end of the day, at the end of the week, as this week draws to a close--the week when the wood is on all sides of parliament to put forward their plan--the sum total of released costed policies from the LNP stands at zero. The sum total of the contribution to public policy debate by the LNP as the week draws to a close is zero. You can hear it in their tricky language. They do not talk about their policies; they talk about their announcements. They do not talk about the things that they have costed; they talk only about their announcements. They are nothing more than pronouncements. They do not have anything behind them to back them up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187651"></A>
What we hear are claims like the claim contained in the shadow Treasurer’s budget reply that they had ‘a detailed four-point plan to address the cost of water’. Has this parliament ever seen a costed policy to address the cost of water from the LNP? The answer is no. Is there such a policy document in existence? No. They talk about their pronouncement around registration costs. Has this parliament ever been presented with but a skerrick of a piece of paper that might even scratch out a few numbers about how they might achieve that? The answer of course is no. Only once has Campbell Newman said what he thought it might cost, and he missed it by a million miles. You cannot dress up thought bubbles as policies. This parliament and the people of Queensland deserve more than that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187652"></A>
What we heard in the reply from the shadow Treasurer was a series of pronouncements, as uncosted as they were--insubstantial. Nowhere did they say how it is that they are going to fund the abolition of the ambulance levy, which they pretend to support. The budget papers spell it out. They did not even need to work it out for themselves. It is $700 million that they have to fund to support the abolition of the ambulance levy. This government has presented a plan which provides for the ability to fund the abolition. What have we seen from those opposite? We have not seen anything that comes anywhere close. They made a claim that they would support the ambulance levy but not support any of the tough choices that implement that, that provide the funds to implement that. They then said they thought that their estimate was somewhere ‘around $250 million’. Well, $700 million is the cost of abolishing the ambulance levy. These guys are way, way short of the mark when it comes to an ability to present a costed plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187654"></A>
What the opposition need to do in putting forward their pronouncements is go beyond the rhetoric, go beyond the press release, and put forward a policy for Queensland. We saw it yesterday when the question was asked about the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. It revealed everything that all of us need to know--that all the people of Queensland need to know--about the Newman experiment, about the Newman proposition. And it was this: he does not suffer from any self-doubt; he thinks he knows everything; and, if he was going to be questioned about it, he thought he could skate his way through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187656"></A>
When the question was asked, he came up short. When the number was asked, he came up short. When he was asked to explain it, he came up short. He told the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 one thing, saying he was taking out $100 million over four years--that is $400 million out of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. He put around a piece of paper to other journalists saying it was $180 million. But he would not send it to the <Hansard-Italic>
Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 because he knew that they were right on top of him and that he did not know what he was talking about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187657"></A>
He thought that a hospital was a tunnel. Well, guess what? A hospital is not a tunnel. A hospital does not make money. I think anyone who knows a little bit about public finance would know that a hospital does not generate those funds, unless of course it is Campbell Newman’s plan that he is going to charge the people who turn up at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital full tote odds for the services that they receive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187660"></A>
The famous five on the Sunshine Coast--those who could not even secure a commitment out of their last leader--have done worse by plumping for Campbell Newman. At least the last leader used to pretend that he supported it, not Campbell Newman’s proposal to rip $400 million out of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. The notion that you can build a $2 billion hospital for $800 million does not ring true. If you went to buy a $20,000 car, do you think you could pretend that all you needed to do was pay $8,000 up front and the rest of the $12,000 you did not need to pay? Deutsche Bank is not going to turn up and donate the rest of the hospital. Watpac is not going to turn up and donate the rest of the hospital. Someone has to pay for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187664"></A>
Ultimately what Campbell Newman revealed is that he does not understand the concept of social infrastructure PPPs. The fact that they had not done their homework, the fact that they thought they could skate by it and the fact that they thought they did not have to answer the questions reveals everything you need to know about the Newman experiment. When it comes down to it, he has got nothing. When the question was asked, it was revealed that he knew nothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187666"></A>
As this week draws to a close, it is clear in my view that Congressman Weiner has had a better week than would-be parliamentarian Newman. After all, when Congressman Weiner found out that everyone could see that he was wearing no clothes, he had the integrity and the decency to resign. What we now see is that the ‘little emperor’ has not worked out yet that the people of Queensland can see that the slogans he cloaks himself in are nothing. The ‘little emperor’ has been revealed to have no clothes--that, underneath it all, there is nothing there. It turns out that Congressman Weiner, demonstrating the integrity that he did, showed that he is a far bigger man that Campbell Newman. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187667"></A>
Let us be clear. What this week has shown is the yawning chasm between this Labor government--which has come into this parliament with each and every one of the budgets presented under this government and put forward proposals for reform, proposals to look to the future, proposals full of courage and vision for the future--and the indolent LNP, who have yet to propose a single policy in this place. In nine months time there is going to be a choice for Queensland. We presented a budget that takes choices for Queensland; that levels with the people of Queensland; that says we are going to make the choices; that says we have the guts, the imagination and the vision to make those choices. What did you see on the other side through the budget week, Mr Speaker? You saw what you have seen before--and that is you saw zip, zero, zilch. At the end of the budget week, we see a costed plan for the future prosperity of the state from this government--always striving for a better future. On the other side, it has finally been revealed that when it comes to economic credibility and a plan for the future the LNP is naked. </Hansard-Body>

This delay to the start of the provisions that it refers to, part 7, seems to effect an impact in terms of the beginning of the changes to the stamp duty and the concessional regime.

<A ID="pgfId-1194511"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. The reason for this commencement date of 1 August is to align with the removal of the concession that the government has proposed in the budget. This is to ensure that there would not be a crossover period between the removal of the concession and the availability of the $10,000 proposed Queensland Building Boost that the government has put forward in the budget papers. This provides the opportunity, firstly, for the policy priority for one alignment. Secondly, it means that there is a six-week period under which those in the marketplace presently who were looking to access the principal place of residence deduction have an adequate notice period of time before that change takes place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194512"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In light of that, will the Treasurer advise whether he is expecting any changes in terms of the activity in the market as a result of the delay--that is, from people who perhaps were intending to buy but who will now delay making a decision to buy for that six-week period?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194513"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. Obviously, some people looking to make a decision will look to access the Building Boost which is available from 1 August--that much is plain. The government’s intention here is that the availability of the $10,000 Queensland Building Boost will in fact prompt people to change their decision and not look towards buying established homes but look towards buying a newly constructed home at that time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194514"></A>
Certainly, the government has considered the opportunity to move market share from entry into the established home market to entry into the new housing market. That is what lies at the core of the design of the scheme--to promote new housing construction. The shadow Treasurer and other members of the parliament should be aware that if there are present contracts that have been signed then the provisions which apply generally in the first home owner grant scheme and more generally in the stamp duty scheme mean that changes cannot be made to those contracts to have them artificially fall over and then have them re-signed at a different time. Any such contract in those circumstances would not be eligible to access the boost.</Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Up>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110617_223303" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (10.32 pm): This clause follows on from part 2 which relates to matters relating to the repeal of community ambulance cover. It is interesting to note that this legislation, put together in this government’s usual tricky and deceptive format, is designed of course not to allow a proper ventilation of the matters relating to the removal of the community ambulance tax--Labor’s community ambulance tax imposed in a period of panic under Peter Beattie in 2002. We all remember in 2002 when Peter Beattie panicked and promised everyone a free ride to a hospital and then realised when he spoke to his Treasurer that he did not have the money to pay for it and in a typical Beattie-esque and Laboresque fashion immediately sought to put the tax--Labor’s ambulance tax--straight on to the rates notice.</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201382"></A>
Of course, he failed to take into account his good and long faithful friend down at City Hall in Jim Soorley, who immediately picked up the blower to Beattie and said, ‘Hang on a second, Pete. What’s the discussion about this crazy idea you’ve got? Hang on, we’re not real keen on this.’ He in fact managed to get all of the mayors--something that is very rarely able to be done--of Queensland together. He got all the mayors together in a way that has not been matched until the current Treasurer, when he was the local government minister, got all of the mayors together when they said, ‘We don’t like what you’re doing. What’s this plan you’re springing on us--this plan that you actually haven’t discussed with us, that you didn’t flag in any election policy, that you never made an item of faith, that you never spoke about.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201385"></A>
It is a bit like the amalgamation of councils that the government never spoke about, that it went to an election deceiving the people of Queensland about; a bit like the sale of assets that it never put out as a policy and went to the people of Queensland about; a bit like the fuel tax that it never told people that it was going to impose and in fact said quite the opposite. A bit like those policies, that was the genesis of Labor’s ambulance tax--another tax, a tax that the current Treasurer in his own budget speech said is a regressive tax and a tax that eventually, because of the ineptness of the then Labor government and ineptness that has not changed in the subsequent nine years, had to be applied to people’s power bills. This tax had so many exemptions and qualifications to it that it became a nightmare to administer and led to all sorts of perverse outcomes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201387"></A>
When electricity was much cheaper before this government decided to undertake its reform program--when electricity was much cheaper before this government decided that it knew how to reform electricity that led to a 50 per cent increase over the last three years in electricity bills--it almost got away with it. But eventually it got caught up with and eventually it had to move to remove the insidious Labor ambulance tax. So how has the government chosen to go about doing that? It has referred to the Labor book of dirty tricks and put two bills together. It has put two bills together in order to camouflage the activities of one with the other in a somewhat puerile and certainly easily seen through attempt to try to cause grief for the LNP. Is that the act of a government that has principles? Is that the act of a government that is transparent? Is that the act of a government that is honest with people? Quite clearly it is not.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1201389"></A>
There is a very clear reason we voted against this bill on its second reading, and that very clear reason is that this bill also imposes a new tax--a new $7,000 tax on every family who owns a home or a unit or a town house wherever they may be. From Currumbin to Cooktown and from Brisbane to Biloela, it does not make any difference. That is why we voted against it, because Labor has attempted to deceive people by trying to cover off on the removal of the community ambulance levy while at the same time imposing a new tax in the one piece of legislation. The people of Queensland and the people in this parliament are under no mistake: the LNP has opposed the ambulance tax since its inception and has vigorously opposed and has continued to oppose it since it was introduced by a government that failed to tell the people of Queensland what it was doing and failed to tell the people of Queensland that it was going to do what it did--in fact, in much the same way as the Treasurer failed to tell the then transport minister that he was going to sell Queensland Rail. We all remember that day back in May 2009 when the then transport minister, the member for Ipswich, said that there were no plans to sell Queensland Rail. Wrong! Wrong again! Wrong again!</Hansard-Body>

Turning now in particular to clause 6 and the provision that ensures that levy amounts collected before the repeal can be required afterwards, I would ask the Treasurer in particular if he could detail how much of that levy is outstanding at present and how much levy has been collected prior to the repeal and is expected to be received after the commencement of the act.</Hansard-Body>

 Come in, spinner! That speech will not save you. That was a definite attempt in a desperate situation to pretend that the LNP did not vote against the abolition of the community ambulance cover levy. I am happy to answer the question. For the benefit of the muppets corner, I point out that the answer is already in the budget papers. But I will come to that in a moment, because I admire the fact that the shadow Treasurer had that nice six-minute introduction to the question. The point is that what we just saw was a speech in defence of the fact that the LNP just voted to keep the ambulance levy on 1.4 million Queensland households and businesses. The LNP just walked into this parliament and voted against the Community Ambulance Cover Levy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. </Hansard-Body>

We saw in this budget presentation a very clear proposition that the government proposed choices. We proposed a way to fund the abolition of the ambulance levy and the package that is presented in the budget is whole. If the LNP is going to attempt to make it severable then it needs to be honest with the people of Queensland. The LNP just voted to support the retention of the ambulance levy because it wants to campaign on the choice that this government has made. The choice for the people of Queensland is, in fact--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As was made clear in the presentation of the budget and in the budget documents, the ambulance levy will be abolished from 1 July. Of course, that means that liability accrues up to 1 July. Therefore, people receiving a bill in the coming months will not be liable, nor will they be billed for any levy liability beyond 1 July. However, any accrued liability at this point, of course, remains payable up to and including 1 July. That is, if you receive your bill, for instance, on 31 July--a three-month bill--then it will contain the levy liability for the month of May and June, but not for July. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1208348"></A>
Secondly, if you receive your bill on 28 September, it would have no liability from 1 July to 28 September but, presuming your previous bill was on 28 June, it would have two days--that being the difference between 28 June and 1 July. The answer to the shadow Treasurer’s question is on page 83 of the budget papers in table 4.5, where an amount of $25 million is recorded as being expected to be received because of that accrued liability in the coming financial year. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. The point I was making is that there is accrued liability on people’s bills at present that have not been issued. Given that the liability ends on 1 July, that will continue to be collected for the liability up until 1 July. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1208358"></A>
The government has met with the electricity retailers. We met with them on Tuesday--the day that the budget was presented. Certainly, the government has consulted in the first instance with its own electricity retailer, being Ergon, which believes that it has systems in place that will ensure there is no liability accruing for that period of time beyond 1 July. But obviously, all electricity retailers will need to make those adjustments to their own systems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1208360"></A>
The savings provisions in the bill provide that if someone is issued with a bill and pays the levy for a period of time beyond 1 July--whether by mistake or whether by not seeing that the system for their electricity retailer provides that capability--then we can provide that refund. As to what that refund amount is going to be, that depends on what comes to pass after 1 July. But I can advise the House that the best information that I have from those discussions--I was not able to be at them personally on Tuesday for fairly obvious reasons--is that the electricity retailers as a group thought this repeal was able to be implemented in time. Therefore, the point is that these provisions provide that, should it be the case that someone provides the payment of a levy that ultimately is not due because it is for a liability post 1 July, in those circumstances that would be refundable to the customer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1208361"></A>
The government’s proposal, in talking with the electricity retailers, is to include a flyer in everyone’s bills for the period of time towards the end of the year going through that billing cycle, which I just spoke of, which indicates to everybody, firstly, the important message that the ambulance remains free for all Queenslanders, especially for pensioners and concession card holders. I am aware that some have expressed concern to some MPs--I presume on the other side of the House--that they now need to access other ambulance cover. That is not the case. The flyer will make the very clear point that everyone remains covered for ambulance services around the state. It will also provide information about the part arrangements for the liability prior to 1 July and post 1 July. It will also provide information to electricity bill receivers about what to do in those circumstances, the number to ring and the website to visit to contact their electricity retailer to ensure that everyone in these circumstances is not ultimately liable for a levy that we are removing on 1 July.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Treasurer for that part of the information. There are two things that flow from his answer. First, in the event that people do not apply for whatever reason, what happens to the revenue that has been accrued? Do the retailers pass that revenue to the government, or do they take a proportion for administering the levy and doing all of that work? The second part of my question is: in terms of the advertising, how much is it going to cost for the government to advertise the removal of this scheme? Who is going to sign off on that advertising? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1208365"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The liability does not accrue after 1 July. So if an electricity retailer is overpaid in those circumstances, given that it has issued a bill, it would merely credit that amount to the next account that the retailer issues. This is a savings provision. The best way to explain it might be a circumstance where someone has been paying the ambulance levy but, in fact, as a pensioner or concession card holder should not have previously been paying it. So quite separate to the fact that the levy is being abolished in those circumstances, this provision provides for them to be able to access a refund in that case.</Hansard-Body>

 At this point the government is negotiating with the retailers that they will assume the cost for inserting a flyer in electricity bills. Obviously, that is a discussion that we are having with the electricity retailers, but there are savings that accrue to them in terms of no longer having to administer the levy. Therefore, the government is in negotiation to provide for that. </Hansard-Body>

If we are not able to reach an agreement with the electricity retailers on that front then the government would fund that and I would be happy to disclose that amount to the parliament when that amount is determined. We do think that it is in the interests of consumers to firstly emphasise that the ambulance is still available for everybody, especially for pensioners and concession card holders who have indicated some confusion on this point. I see the member is nodding agreement. That is something that has been reported to members on this side of the chamber. Secondly, to also provide for the pointer to consumers of their ability to access a refund if they believe that there is one entitled. </Hansard-Body>

This is central to the budget we have presented. The attempts by the LNP in speaking to this clause are to show feebly, to those constituents who will no doubt ask members opposite into the future--and we will ensure that they get asked--why it is that they voted against the repeal of the community ambulance cover levy, the comments of the shadow Treasurer as some attempt to say that, in fact, on that clause they voted for it.

The LNP is opposing the government’s proposal to repeal the community ambulance cover levy. As to the claims that this somehow represents LNP policy, well, I have seen not one LNP policy. If the shadow Treasurer cannot put forward a policy in this term of the parliament perhaps he could justify the outrageous claim he just made to this parliament by tabling at the earliest opportunity a copy from the 2009 election of the LNP policy to abolish the community ambulance cover levy because guess what? There was not one. Just like now there is not one. Despite the fact that they seek to protest, let the record show from tonight and ever more that the LNP, hook, line and sinker just decided not to vote for the repeal of the community ambulance cover levy. </Hansard-Body>

(10.55 pm): This clause deals with the provisions in relation to what is commonly called land rich companies and the transfer of the ownership of land rich companies and revolves around the impacts there. In the forward estimates it is estimated to raise $30 million a year each year over the next four years. I just wonder what modelling the Treasurer has done in order to come up with that figure given that it is a constant figure over the next four years, and what impact is anticipated to occur in terms of transactions involving land rich companies as a result of these changes? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If the member looks to the budget papers, it records that transfer duty will, in fact, accrue $2.18 billion over the coming financial year. So in that regard the $30 million is ascribed to the change in moving to harmonise our system from the land rich system that was in place to the landholder arrangements that exist in other states in the pursuit of national tax harmonisation. It is important to put the $30 million forecast in perspective. This was a measure that was announced and debated in the public arena at the time of the delivery of the midyear review. The budget papers record this was an initiative announced at the time of the midyear review. This is about a tax harmonisation proposal rather than any other motivation from the government. It was a system that required an overhaul because of arrangements that were being put in place with the former land rich system that saw arrangements to avoid tax liability. Therefore, in those circumstances where the otherwise accruable liability was being avoided through tax arrangements, the government saw fit to protect the revenue base by undertaking this reform and proposing that we move to a landholder model. The estimate of $30 million is one that has been provided by the Office of State Revenue. </Hansard-Body>

 As I outlined in my answer on the previous clause, what the government announced at the midyear review was that in moving to this model we were moving to align our taxation arrangements with those now existing in other states. I am aware that Victoria has recently moved to adopt the harmonised national model being pursued here. Therefore, this is consistent with the provisions that operate in substance with the other states. At every point in time, in making this change the government has sought to look towards aligning the substantive provisions with those in other states under the laudable goal that exists for harmonising, as far as possible, the substantive arrangements in the particular acts that operate in the different states, under the concept that such a reform provides an overall economic benefit. </Hansard-Body>

 The shadow Treasurer would be aware that the treatment of dutiable transactions involving trusts is dealt with quite separately in Queensland. It is an area, as I have just been talking about, where national harmonisation is taking place. It is an area where there is an entirely different regime that operates in Queensland.

This is where amendments are made to the definition of homes by removing from the concession provisions of the legislation the term ‘a home’, thus adding another tax to the purchase of a new home--that is, it is not a freshly built home but when a family changes homes to a new residential home. It is typical of Labor that it does not believe in supporting those who want to buy their own home. We will be opposing clauses 129 to 133. </A></Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Tonight the LNP might want to protest that what it is doing is providing assistance in the housing market. In fact, what it is doing is denying $140 million of Queensland Building Boost assistance, which is giving the potential not only for Queenslanders who have never owned their own home but also for other Queenslanders to acquire a property under the $10,000 Building Boost grant. I have long been hankering to conduct a policy debate in this parliament and a policy debate in the public arena. As of tonight, by nailing their colours to the mast, the LNP has provided the people of Queensland with an even clearer choice. I am very glad for it. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1222790"></A>
And that has been a good little earner for the government. I notice in the explanatory notes that the Treasurer talks about the increase in property prices and the increase in wealth as if that only accrues to the people who actually own their own homes. However, he failed to acknowledge the huge lift in revenue that this government has received since 2006 as a result of the increase in property prices throughout the state and how this government has continued to spend beyond its means as the amount of that money rose. So the government has raised $12 billion in stamp duty, as reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. That article continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222792"></A>
But the State Government yesterday said it should be dumped.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222793"></A>
Treasurer Andrew Fraser described stamp duty as a “relic” and an “inefficient” tax.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222794"></A>
He said it would be at the top of the state’s “hit list” at a federal tax summit later this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222795"></A>
Those people who read those musings by the Treasurer, those ideas about what he was going to do, will be sorely disappointed today with this particular provision. So by his own admission, the Treasurer knows that this is a relic and a tax that should no longer be applicable. But what does he do in this budget? He increases the amount of the tax and he increases it so that the value to the bottom line of the budget this year--the extra tax take--will be $161 million in 2011-12, increasing to $247 million in 2012-13 and all the way up to $272 million in 2014-15. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222796"></A>
He also spoke about this being a concession. I thought it would be interesting to go through some of the history of the principal place of residence concession. In 1982-83 the budget handed down by the then Treasurer, now Sir Llewllyn Edwards--I might say an outstanding constituent in the seat of Clayfield and a predecessor; someone who knew how to represent people and to represent them effectively--stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222799"></A>
The Government has been able to formulate its Budget without having to resort to increases in the rates of taxation or introducing new forms of tax such as business franchise fees for tobacco and petrol. At the same time, very significant concessions have been provided in death duties, pay-roll tax, land tax, stamp duty, road maintenance charges, road transport permit fees and so on. The overall effect has been to maintain--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1222800"></A>
And members opposite should listen to this because you do not hear this too often these days in Queensland--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222802"></A>
Queensland’s enviable position of being the lowest tax State in Australia. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222803"></A>
Those are words that have never been--and will never be able to be--uttered by a Labor government in Queensland: the enviable position of being the lowest taxed state in Australia and being able to offer concessions without having to resort to increases in the rates of taxation or introducing new fees or charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222805"></A>
So established had that concession been that, when the new Duties Act was introduced, it was not introduced as something of an afterthought; it was actually included from the ground up. It had actually become, in truth, a lower rate of tax. So, in effect, the government is increasing the tax on the family home in Queensland. It will be an impost on families throughout the length and breadth of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222806"></A>
Two-thirds of people purchasing a home will need to sell their existing home. How will that be made easier by increasing the tax? In order to grow the economy, people need to transfer their property with the least amount of disincentive for doing so. This is what the Henry tax review said in relation to these sorts of issues--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222808"></A>
Removing stamp duties would improve the supply of housing, as well as reducing a range of other adverse impacts on the housing market. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1222809"></A>
He said not increasing the tax, but removing the tax. The review went on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222810"></A>
By suppressing the number of transactions undertaken in the housing market, stamp duties reduce the effective supply of housing. More transactions means a better matching of people to housing, which in turn means a given housing stock can effectively house more people. By adding to the cost of moving to a larger house--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1222811"></A>
Which is what increasing the stamp duty does--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1222813"></A>
stamp duty encourages people to renovate rather than re-locate. This means that more investment is channelled into making existing housing larger than into more affordable and newer housing. These impacts on the supply of housing are on top of the personal costs of stamp duty, which arise when people live in houses that are ill-suited to their needs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222814"></A>
Thus speaks Labor’s favoured secretary of the Treasury up until a couple of months ago, Ken Henry, in the Henry tax review. He makes it clear that what the Treasurer is proposing is not economic structural reform. This is not making an upchange in the economy that the Treasurer so often talks about. This is not providing for the people who want to move into Mackay, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Townsville and all those other regions as the structure of our economy changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230033"></A>
What this does is suppress the number of transactions undertaken in the market. What it does is reduce the effective supply of housing and what it does is add to the cost of moving and has a personal impact on people when they want to sell their house. In making this decision, not only has the Treasurer failed in economics, not only has he sought to extract hundreds of millions of dollars extra, but he has also put a terrible impost on people, those 60 per cent of people who move into established homes--not into newly built homes but into established homes--and who will want to do so in the market at any given time. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to this change--this new Labor tax on property, on the family home--the Treasurer talks about making hard decisions. It is no hard decision to whack a new tax on someone and it is certainly no hard decision to increase the deficit for one year in order to sugar-coat the $140 million Building Boost that he talks about which will lead to a $111 million net loss to the budget bottom line this year but will lead to a $116 million net improvement to the bottom line next year, $118 million in 2013-14 and $117 million in 2014-15, for a total new tax take for the Queensland government--by taxing people’s family homes--of $351 million. This is an economically unsound tax. It will suppress the supply of affordable housing to people. It will act as a disincentive to moving. It is regressive in all ways, and that is why we are opposing it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230037"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let me make it really clear that I stand by all of the comments that I have made on tax reform in the past and, more to the point, look forward to being an advocate for tax reform into the future. Let me make this point against the tilting at windmills from the shadow Treasurer and the unsubstantiated claims that go to the nth degree. If it were the case that this change, proposed by this government in order to fund the initiatives that we have proposed in this budget, was in fact as heinous as he suggests, the fact is that after 1 August, when this change is implemented, Queensland will continue to have at every price point lower stamp duty than every other mainland state of Australia and all the way to $900,000 and above in Tasmania. So if the claims that the shadow Treasurer make were in any way true then there would not be a housing market in any of the other states, because beyond 1 August our regime will continue to be lower than that which exists today in each and every other state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230038"></A>
We very clearly made a choice between those who have already had the benefit of getting into the property market and those who have not. We chose to assist those who have not had the ability to get into the property market. It is a well-known tax design principle that of course the efficiency of a tax is promoted by the broadening of the base. A commentary that was in the quoted Henry tax review pointed to the fact that, when it came to many taxes that existed at both the state and Commonwealth level, one of the issues that the Henry tax review took was with compartmentalising the base and therefore going towards the inefficiency of the operation of the existing tax base. It has long been my view on the record on these matters that tax reform is required in the Federation into the future, and I will continue to be an advocate for that. But know and understand that when Queensland makes this decision we do so to maintain the lowest stamp duty for all homeowners in Queensland as compared to all of the other mainland states of Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230039"></A>
Let me also make the point against the claims of the shadow Treasurer, who I noted had to go all the way back to 1982 before he could find a tory Treasurer who was worth quoting, because of course he would not want to remember at this moment the former member for Caloundra, Treasurer Sheldon, who introduced her ‘seven deadly taxes’ budget into this place. Of course he wants to remember when she famously lectured, ‘If you listen to me, you might learn something.’ Well, listen to me and you might learn something here. Listen to me when I say that Queensland will continue to have the lowest stamp duty at every price point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230040"></A>
More to the point, for the benefit of the House, Queensland today and into the future will continue to have the lowest tax regime, bar Tasmania. Let me be clear: it is $2,268 per capita in Queensland. What is it in New South Wales? It is $2,897--it is higher, run by the tories. What is it in Victoria? $2,712--higher, run by the tories. What is it in Western Australia? $2,944--higher, run by the tories. What is it in South Australia? $2,477. Do not take my word for it. On the budget papers, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has assessed taxation effort which shows for all states--independently assessed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission--Queensland has the lowest taxation effort of each and every state. So on any measure the claims from those opposite are merely rhetorical claims. Once again, what is the problem with them? It is just that no numbers support their claim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230043"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Where do I start with those claims? There was a little bit I did not actually report in terms of the Henry tax review that the Treasurer attempted to spin in some bizarre fashion. Henry says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1230045"></A>
Whilst the Building Boost grant may temporarily increase the supply of housing, the stamp duty increases are permanent and will adversely impact housing supply and affordability in the long term. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230046"></A>
That is what Henry says. Not only does he say it will suppress the number of transactions, not only does he say it will not lead to a better matching of people to house--which, in turn, means that given housing stock effectively houses more people--not only does he say there are high personal costs, not only does he say it discourages moving and encourages people investing more; but also he says it ‘may temporarily increase the supply of housing, the stamp duty increases are permanent and will adversely impact the housing supply and affordability in the long term’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230047"></A>
Then the Treasurer goes on to say that we still have lower stamp duty than Victoria. Then why, Treasurer, have more Queenslanders chosen to move to Victoria than Victorians have chosen to move to Queensland, according to the ABS studies? If that was so great, why has a class of economic refugees been driven to Victoria over the last 18 months? We are talking about Queenslanders who make up the vast bulk of the transfers of properties in established houses--60 per cent are in established houses, not new properties but established houses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230048"></A>
So the Treasurer talks about tax reform--and he does talk about tax reform; he talked about it with the Henry tax review. It is sitting on the shelf. It is not in action--not one action has come from it. The only thing that came out of it was the resource super profits tax, and where was the Treasurer on the resource super profits tax? Was he standing up for Queensland or was he standing up for Canberra? Just like the minerals resource rent tax and just like Canberra’s carbon tax. The Treasurer talks a lot about reform, but what he really means is increasing taxes. Even in the fact sheets put out by the government on their website today he talks about changes to transfer duty rates. All through his speech he cannot even say that the tax is going up. They talk about changes to the transfer duty rates, but there is not a skerrick of a word about an ‘increase’ in the amount payable. He puts it there in his $10,000 Building Boost information fact sheet and in the First Home Concession and Vacant Land Concession fact sheet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1230082"></A>
Queenslanders should worry when this Labor government talks about tax reform because it only ever means that you are paying more. In fact, under this government, under this change, what we know is that for the first year it goes down by $111 million, as they sugar-coat the bill with a $140 million building grant. I note that the grant is actually available to investors, to anyone it seems. Do you even have to be an Australian to get it? Can it be anyone? It says companies, investors, first home owners.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1230083"></A>
All of this is to stimulate growth in the market. The Treasurer has 14,000 of these $10,000 grants to hand out. The figures show that on average there are 7,000 new constructions in Queensland a quarter so they are happening anyway. They are all going to be swallowed up by the Building Boost Grant. Is this actually going to stimulate anything else, as opposed to the long-term destruction of value in a homeowner’s property? That has been described by Henry and by others in terms of their report. Make no mistake about it, this is a tax grab, pure and simple. </Hansard-Body>
