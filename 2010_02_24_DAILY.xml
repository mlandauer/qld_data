 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.32 am): It is very pleasing to see that Queensland is experiencing what appears to be a normal wet season with life giving rain being delivered to many parts of the state. Unfortunately, we cannot control Mother Nature and over the last two months some of this rain has caused flooding and disrupted many communities across Queensland. Sadly, several people have also lost their lives as a result of this flooding. As our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have lost lives, I again remind all Queenslanders to take extreme caution around watercourses, particularly following torrential rain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998407"></A>
During the recent flooding events, our emergency response agencies, local governments and SES volunteers have again done an outstanding job responding to calls for assistance throughout Queensland and in providing a helping hand where required. The government has also actively been assessing the nature and extent of the disaster relief that needs to be provided. To date, the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services has activated natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements for 50 local government areas. In all but one area relief measures have only been activated to assist with the costs of counterdisaster operations and the restoration of essential public assets. Following an assessment by the Department of Communities, assistance under the disaster relief assistance scheme has been activated for people living within the Isaac Regional Council, particularly those in the Clairview and St Lawrence areas, experiencing personal hardship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998416"></A>
I am pleased to advise the House that while the recent flooding events have caused some significant damage across the state, most people who have been affected on this occasion have been able to personally cope with the damage and have had the capacity to meet their immediate needs. This ability to cope with the aftermath of natural disasters such as these flooding events demonstrates the continuing resilience of Queenslanders as well as the commitment of our emergency service workers to put in place strategies to help mitigate the challenges associated when events like flooding occur. </Hansard-Body>

Arts and Cultural Sector Plan</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998434"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): Yesterday I was pleased to launch the Queensland Arts and Cultural Sector Plan 2010-2013 here at Parliament House. More than 1,400 people from across Queensland have contributed to this four-year industry development framework to build a strong and sustainable arts and cultural sector in Queensland. This sector plan promotes key values that are integral to a strong and vibrant arts and cultural sector such as shared leadership, industry partnerships, closer working relationships with our government partners and stronger national and global networks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998445"></A>
The plan’s goals and strategies focus on five key areas. They are: great arts and culture; engaged audiences and culturally active communities; a strong and diverse economy; creative spaces and places; and a commitment to ongoing learning. By focusing on these key areas we can create an arts and cultural sector where everyone can be involved in the arts as part of their daily lives, where our artists and producers are creating quality arts and cultural experiences and where we have the right facilities and spaces for a vibrant creative culture. The plan focuses on ways to stimulate creativity, entrepreneurship and the use of new media and technologies as ways to grow the sector’s contribution to the economy and to employment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998454"></A>
It is important for Queenslanders to recognise the contribution the arts community makes to all our lives--culturally, socially and economically. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics identified in 2008 that 85 per cent of Australians aged 15 years and over attended cultural activities at least once a year. Statistics from 2006 indicate that 3.5 million Australians worked in the cultural sector and in 2006-07 this sector exported cultural goods valued at $534.1 million. Over the past 10 years, Queensland has greatly enhanced its place within the national cultural landscape with programs of international significance at the Gallery of Modern Art and the State Library building, and at the redeveloped Queensland Performing Arts Centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998467"></A>
This is only part of the story. Longstanding Queensland favourites like the Woodford Folk Festival, the Gympie Music Muster and the Laura Dance Festival along with the growing national and international recognition for Queensland’s lively small to medium arts organisations attest to the remarkable creative energy of arts and culture here in our state. Best of all, we can look forward with confidence to the emergence of new creative projects and events to add to this record. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998476"></A>
The Cairns Indigenous Arts Fair, staged for the first time last year, has brought new levels of interest and recognition to the quality and diversity of Queensland’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts and culture. That program arose out of the Arts and Cultural Sector Plan that preceded the one I launched yesterday. The opening of the new facility the Edge at the Cultural Centre later this week will also drive a whole new wave of creative output using digital technologies. We will stage the state’s first-ever design triennial, focusing on design thinking from the Asia-Pacific region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998487"></A>
The arts and cultural sector in Queensland is not only alive and well, it is making an extraordinary contribution to life in our state--to our prosperity, to our national and international reputation and to individual and community wellbeing. The Queensland Arts and Cultural Sector Plan for the next three years, which I launched yesterday, will provide the platform for the next stage of growth, will guide government decision making and investment in arts and culture and will provide for future success for our artists and cultural workers. </Hansard-Body>

Ready Readers Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998518"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): Today we kick-start our campaign to further boost the literacy skills of Queensland students. Today we begin our efforts to recruit an army of volunteers to read with children in our schools. With our Queensland Ready Readers program we seek to raise an army of 3,000 volunteers to share the magic of reading with our students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000801"></A>
The Ready Readers program is part of our determination to give Queensland children a flying start in education. The Ready Readers program is based on national and international research that shows that well-trained and supported community volunteers can make a big difference to children’s learning. Reading fuels young imaginations and it can help a child’s listening and language skills. It can promote attention and curiosity and can put them on the right track for a great start to their education. The Ready Readers initiative is part of an $8.7 million four-year funding commitment that includes new funding for Volunteering Queensland to work across Queensland with businesses and community organisations. It also includes funding for a major social marketing campaign around the importance of reading which will also be launched today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000808"></A>
It will draw on the fantastic skills of people out there in our community. Many members will know people in their own electorates who are very keen to get involved in their local school communities but often do not know how to go about it. Volunteering Queensland--a great Queensland organisation that is very well versed in recruiting volunteers and training them and supporting them--will manage the registration of interested volunteers through its website. This website contains registration forms, information about training requirements and time lines for when the initiative will be launched in specific areas. All volunteers will be trained in the Support A Reader process and will be required to go through the standard checks for working with children, and they will read with students in our schools under the direction of classroom teachers. The first Ready Readers will be in our classrooms in Toowoomba, Townsville and Wide Bay by the start of second semester this year. The program will then be progressively rolled out so that all parts of the state will be covered by the beginning of school next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000815"></A>
Today I have the pleasure of officially welcoming our first volunteer Ready Reader. Wyllene Banks is a former voluntary librarian and tuckshop helper and, most importantly, she is a passionate reader who will be a valuable asset to the program. Wyllene stars in our Ready Readers ads which aired on television last night in the three areas we are initially kicking off in. The ads promote reading awareness and will be aired state-wide and I hope that they encourage mums and dads and family members to take up the challenge to read to their children more often and more regularly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000822"></A>
The 2009 Australian Early Development Index shows that, nationally, approximately 70 per cent of children are regularly read to at home. This compared to 61 per cent of children in Queensland. Literacy starts at home. The ability for our teachers and our schools to build on a child’s literacy skills is enhanced when they come into our classrooms with some of the benefits of reading at home. So we need to ensure that parents understand what an important part of parenting this is and to make some priority for it, even if it is only a couple of minutes a day. I encourage all Queenslanders to consider becoming a Ready Reader. I urge them to log on to the Volunteering Queensland website to see what is involved. It is a fantastic opportunity for people to contribute to our children’s education, to be involved in their community and to support the good work that is being done by our teachers in schools right across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.42 am): The Bligh government recognises that we have an ageing and growing population, and this means that we face huge challenges when it comes to delivering health care over the next 40 years. Australians are living longer. We now have the second longest life expectancy in the world. That means that a child born in 2010 can expect to live to 81 whereas a child born in 1965 will live, on average, to 71. Indeed, in 1910 the average male life expectancy was 59. But as we live longer our healthcare system will face greater challenges. According to the Commonwealth Treasury’s 2010 intergenerational report, the proportion of Australia’s population aged over 65 will almost double over the next 40 years and the population aged over 80 will quadruple.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000831"></A>
Whilst our life expectancy is one of the longest in the world, we are facing a greater burden when it comes to chronic disease. We have the shortest elective surgery wait times in the nation and our ED wait times have improved from sixth to third, but we know we have to do better. That is why we committed to releasing monthly ED data and publish our quarterly public hospitals performance report, because unlike the National and Liberal Party we know that accountability breeds excellence. Indeed, there are many members of previous governments on the other side of this House elected before me who were part of that regime of nonaccountability, because we all know that their record is to put nothing on the record. The Bligh government recognises that whilst investment in our hospitals is crucial the fundamental priority--was that a comment from the guy who has never changed a nappy in his life and demonstrated that at parliament the other day?</Hansard-Body>

 The Bligh government recognises that whilst investment in our hospitals is crucial the fundamental priority must be tackling chronic disease, and we recognise that prevention is the best cure. In 2008 we announced our Q2 strategy to make Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people. The Queensland government currently invests more than $460 million in prevention in the Health portfolio alone. Not only do we have campaigns to encourage Queenslanders to give up smoking, drink more responsibly and find 30 minutes a day to exercise and get their two serves of fruit and five serves of vegies every day; we also have campaigns to tackle sexually transmitted diseases, encourage people to get vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases and monitor their blood pressure, just to name a few.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000862"></A>
All this is promising news, but one of our most preventable chronic diseases--type 2 diabetes--is on the rise. The complications of type 2 diabetes include renal failure, cardiovascular disease and loss of lower limbs, not to mention a much poorer quality of life. Over 50 per cent of patients with type 2 diabetes will die prematurely of cardiovascular disease. Diabetes was the sixth leading cause of premature death and disability in Queensland in 2006. The Bligh government recognises that the increased rate of type 2 diabetes is one of the greatest challenges we face in health care. Diabetes currently costs the Queensland economy $500 million per year in hospital, medical, pharmaceutical, allied health and research costs. Over the next 30 years, according to the Commonwealth government intergenerational report, the cost of treating diabetes will rise 436 per cent from $1.6 billion to $8.6 billion. Diabetes related hospitalisations are expected to triple in Queensland to over 300,000 admissions each year by 2028. That is why the Premier and I are pleased to be hosting a diabetes round table next Tuesday to discuss the measures the Queensland government can take to strengthen our response to diabetes with some of Queensland’s leading diabetes clinicians and researchers in this field. The Bligh government is committed to tackling the onslaught of chronic disease. The Bligh government is planning for the future and looking ahead to the health challenges that we know are on the way. </Hansard-Body>

Smart Futures PhD Scholarships</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.47 am): There is a proverb that says that if you are planning for a year sow rice; if you are planning for a decade plant trees; and if you are planning for a lifetime educate people, and that is just what we are doing. We are planning for the future by investing in some of Queensland’s brightest minds through programs like the Smart Futures PhD Scholarship. Today I can announce that 17 Queensland university students will each receive $24,000 over the next three years to support their research on a range of important areas, including how to better identify childhood anxiety, how to better treat health issues like motor neurone disease and prostate cancer, how to promote road safety and how to deal with climate change.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000870"></A>
Last Friday I visited Bond University to see firsthand some of the research projects underway. This round is the first time the government has received applications from Bond for this program. To have four successful recipients out of four applications is a great result and a credit to the students and the academic staff at this university. There are other universities that are also benefiting from our investment in Queensland’s best and brightest. For example, Rachel McGeorge from Griffith University is working on developing more effective drugs to combat malaria, Libby Liggins of UQ is examining the impacts of climate change on key Great Barrier Reef species, Nathan Manthey from USQ in Toowoomba is investigating the use of biocomposites in industry, and Angela Watson of QUT is working on improving the collation of road trauma data to better inform road safety strategies. It is these types of research projects where world firsts are realised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000876"></A>
Since 2006 the government has awarded 80 Smart State and Smart Futures PhD scholarships valued at more than $1.6 million. This is an investment in brains. In the scientific breakthroughs of tomorrow, we are ensuring that Queensland builds a strong foundation of promising early stage researchers who will swell and nourish the ranks of our outstanding researchers into the future. The program is part of our $91 million Smart Futures Fund, which is an integral component of our long-term strategy to assist in the transformation of Queensland into a knowledge based economy and to diversify our traditional economic base. This is at the heart of our strategy to build a stronger Queensland economy powered by innovation and bright ideas for a brighter future.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (9.49 am): The Bligh government is committed to lifting standards in Queensland schools. We have a vision for education in Queensland to help all our children get the flying start that they deserve. We are working hand in hand with the federal government to roll out a range of initiatives designed to boost achievements in the classroom. We are covering different bases by focusing on students, parents, school leadership and teacher quality. We are helping students by mandating teaching times for literacy and numeracy and running summer school programs for students needing an extra helping hand. Turnaround teams and school audits are designed to identify and address whole-of-school issues to lift school performance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000925"></A>
We are also focused on parents as first teachers with our education campaign about the importance of reading to children and preparing them for school, as spoken about by the Premier this morning. When they get there, we know that they will have passionate, dedicated and confident teachers. We want to put more of these teachers in front of Queensland classes. That is why we are providing literacy and numeracy coaches, extra science teachers and extra professional development to give our teachers more support to build their confidence and knowledge in these critical subject areas. We have also introduced preregistration testing to ensure that teachers are graduating with the best possible training so that they have a sound knowledge of literacy, numeracy and science before they begin work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000926"></A>
We have a responsibility to examine any option that might help us get more great teachers into our classrooms and to support the teachers who are there. That is why we are looking at a program introduced by the Australian government and currently at work in Victoria called Teach for Australia. This program gives students practical experience in the classroom while they study for their teaching qualifications. These are highly skilled graduates in other professions, such as engineering or science, who have a passion for teaching. They face a strict set of criteria before being accepted. For example, in Victoria there were just 45 people selected out of 800 applicants. The successful applicants then undertake an intensive six-week training course before beginning their graduate diploma and entering the classroom. The students have a reduced teaching load and work closely with a mentor. This program is just one program that the government is considering and talking to parent and teacher groups about. We are keeping an open mind, and we will keep having an open mind, about anything that will help us give Queensland children a flying start. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (9.52 am): Today is Vindaloo Against Violence day. Vindaloo Against Violence is the creation of Mia Northrop, a Melbourne woman who is encouraging all Australians to take a stand against racial violence today by eating out at their local Indian restaurant. While Queensland has not seen the level of violence that has been witnessed in Victoria, we cannot afford to be complacent. Vindaloo Against Violence is the perfect chance for Queenslanders to show their support for the state’s 26,000-strong Indian community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000933"></A>
I am pleased to inform the House that the cafeteria at Parliament House will be serving Indian cuisine today. Dishes will include tandoori chicken, vegetable pakora and, of course, beef vindaloo. On ABC Radio this morning, Spencer Howson threw out a challenge to MPs who think they can stomach a hot vindaloo. Spencer nominated Vaughan Johnson, the member for Gregory, and I nominated Deputy Premier Paul Lucas. So the challenge is on. Perhaps the chef can come up with an extra hot vindaloo to test their mettle and, Mr Speaker, perhaps you can adjudicate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000936"></A>
I want to encourage as many Queenslanders as possible to enjoy their favourite curry at their local Indian restaurant today. I want to thank the Premier, Mr Speaker and the Leader of the House for supporting Vindaloo Against Violence. I am sure that all members, staff and visitors to the House will get behind this great initiative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000937"></A>
Queensland is home to more than 20,000 Indian students and the Bligh government values their contribution to the state’s cultural, social and economic life. We are getting on the front foot and supporting Queensland’s Indian community. Earlier this year I was pleased to announce the appointment of Umesh Chandra as liaison officer between the Queensland government and the state’s Indian community, and Umesh is here today up in the gallery. I look forward to sharing a curry with him at lunchtime today. </Hansard-Body>

Last Friday, I also visited international students at Griffith University during O Week and I will be meeting students from QUT later day. In addition, this Sunday the Queensland Police Service will be conducting a free information seminar in Brisbane for Indian students, highlighting the range of state government support services that are available to them. The Bligh government is getting right behind Queensland’s Indian community and I want to encourage all members and all Queenslanders to Vindaloo Against Violence today. </Hansard-Body>

Fine Defaulters</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (9.54 am): On 1 January this year we commenced the start of several changes to the laws regarding the recovery of outstanding monies from long-term fine defaulters. Last sitting week, I provided the House with an update on progress of the 12-month wheel-clamping trial. I can now provide an update on the two-year seizure-and-sale trial that commenced at the same time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000943"></A>
This two-year trial targets long-term fine defaulters who owe more than $1,000 and who refuse to accept responsibility for their unpaid fines. The initial phase of the trial is targeting those fine defaulters owing more than $5,000 who were not eligible for the vehicle immobilisation trial. The State Penalties Enforcement Registry team uses information gathered through initial investigations conducted for wheel clamping to identify fine defaulters with assets suitable for seizure and sale. These investigations involved the investigators identifying correct contact details, addresses and assets of these fine defaulters. The team then initiated telephone contact with fine defaulters and outlined the potential enforcement action.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000945"></A>
As at 17 February 2010, 30 individual debtors with debts valued at $336,989 and 22 corporate debtors with debts valued at $223,316 have been identified as suitable candidates for seizure and sale. SPER officers are now starting to work their way through this list. SPER has sent property seizure warning notifications to four individual debtors with debts totalling $92,640 and one corporate debtor owing $17,587. It is pleasing to note that the corporate debtor, whose debt related to a conviction for having an unsafe workplace, finalised their outstanding debt of more than $17,000 after receiving the notice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000946"></A>
Also last week, seizure-and-sale warrants against two fine defaulters were issued to the Bailiffs Office of the Brisbane Magistrates Court. The two debtors have outstanding fines with a combined value of $19,524. If these debtors continue to refuse to meet their obligations and pay their overdue fines, the government will seize assets, including real property, which may include people’s homes. The Bligh government is serious about recovering monies from long-term fine defaulters and we will continue to use all measures available to get these people to pay their debts. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.57 am): I was referring before to the Deputy Premier’s sausages, not to the vindaloo. I absolutely endorse the campaign being run by the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000952"></A>
I am advised that a recent incident occurred at Mackay West State School involving an alleged breach of the Workplace Health and Safety Act in relation to the removal of asbestos-containing material. I have also been advised that an allegation of inappropriate procurement practices has been made against a QBuild staff member subsequent to the incident at the school. The member for Mackay has also conveyed his concern about this allegation directly to me. Like the member for Mackay, I take these allegations very seriously and, as these matters are considered operational, I have asked the director-general of the Department of Public Works to engage a wholly independent third party to investigate these allegations and review all the issues, including both the potential breaches of the Workplace Health and Safety Act 2005 and allegations of inappropriate procurement practices. The director-general has requested that this review be undertaken as a matter of urgency. However, I am advised that the timing of the findings will be dependent upon the review and assessment of all relevant information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000956"></A>
As the Minister for Public Works, I demand that QBuild maintains the highest possible standard in every instance where it is called to remove this substance in government buildings. As I have advised this House previously, I have personal experience in both handling this material and what it can do to people in terms of their health. I also expect departmental staff to uphold the strictest code of conduct when dealing with the public and contractors. Let me be absolutely clear about this: if a breach has occurred those responsible will be dealt with to the full extent possible by the Department of Public Works. Let me also reassure members of the House that the incident occurred during school holidays and at no stage were children, teachers or parents in possible harm’s way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000957"></A>
For the past 15 years the Department of Public Works has been charged with the removal and management in situ of asbestos-containing material in government buildings. During that time more than $130 million has been spent making schools, hospitals and office buildings safe for children, teachers, doctors and all government employees and visitors. This government is committed to the removal of asbestos throughout our schools. At all times we strive to deliver best practice in our asbestos removal work methods. I take very seriously any allegation and I assure the member for Mackay that I will follow up on his concerns. When it comes to the removal of asbestos material, I expect the independent investigation initiated by my department to be rigorous and thorough and that we all should expect nothing less. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.00 am): During the past several months our government has detailed a strong, comprehensive package of measures to protect koalas and their habitat in South-East Queensland. I have released the first of its kind detailed koala habitat mapping for the region. Just this week I called for koala disease research tenders to share in $400,000 in state funding. Next week public comments close on new planning powers for councils. Another crucial component is funding to protect and expand habitat in South-East Queensland. Today I am pleased to launch a new program toward this goal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002161"></A>
To build on our koala habitat program today I can announce a $4 million package to rehabilitate and protect koala habitat in addition to our program of acquisitions. Today I am putting the call out to landholders in koala mapped areas who may wish to use their own block to establish special koala nature refuges under their ownership. The Koala Nature Refuge Program provides landholders with the opportunity to apply for financial assistance to revegetate, rehabilitate and manage koala habitat on their land in priority koala management areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002162"></A>
Funding is conditional upon entering into a binding, perpetual nature refuge agreement to establish a nature refuge over all or part of their property. The new $4 million Koala Nature Refuge Program will recruit landholders with properties of key strategic value for koalas and help them, technically and financially, rehabilitate that land. It is expected that work will begin rehabilitating our first property in Redlands in coming weeks--a joint project at the Redland sewage treatment plant with council. I want to particularly thank Redlands mayor, Melva Hobson, for the support she and her council officers have shown in providing support for our program of habitat acquisition and rehabilitation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002163"></A>
As members are aware, the consultation on the koala planning laws closes on 28 February. The Department of Environment and Resource Management has received 52 submissions. I encourage all Queenslanders to have their say. Officers from the department are continuing to meet with officers from all SEQ councils, including Moreton Bay and Ipswich, to discuss the new instruments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002164"></A>
Koala protection is everyone’s responsibility. Landholders who work with us to establish a nature refuge will leave a lasting legacy for koalas by safeguarding habitat for future generations. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.02 am): The Bligh government is committed to making Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people. We know that a key to good health is being active. That is why we are proud to invest more funding in sport and recreation than any other state. We want to make sure this investment delivers real benefits for Queenslanders. Last year we undertook a review of sports funding programs to make sure that they effectively meet the needs of Queensland communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002168"></A>
Today I am pleased to announce a new package of sport and recreation funding programs to deliver more than $138 million to help build new infrastructure and support initiatives that encourage Queenslanders to get involved in sport and recreation. What is more, these programs will create jobs for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002169"></A>
Under the new model, local sport and recreation organisations, councils and schools will be able to apply for funds under four different programs. The programs are aimed at increasing participation, recruiting more volunteers and encouraging disadvantaged communities to get involved in sport and recreation. The amount of funding that sporting clubs can apply for for minor capital works has more than doubled under this model and applications are open to more organisations than ever before.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002170"></A>
Today’s announcement will also help deliver more than 500 jobs for Queenslanders over the next three years. This is a win-win for Queensland. The four new programs providing funding over three years include: a $38 million Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan to help employ local sport and recreation coordinators; a $51.5 million Sport and Recreation Infrastructure Program; a $27.6 million State Sport and Recreation Organisation Development Program; and an $18 million Active Inclusion Program. There will also be $3 million allocated for industry development.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002171"></A>
The federal government’s 2009 Crawford report made the observation that children from middle-class backgrounds dominate club sport. We are determined to address access to sport and recreation so that no child misses out. Under the Active Inclusion Program we will be making funding available for local organisations to encourage disadvantaged groups to participate in sport and recreation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002172"></A>
Funding rounds are due to be released between March and April this year. Workshops will be held throughout the state over the coming months to explain the new programs to sport and recreation groups. I look forward to seeing local groups making the most of these new opportunities to help Queenslanders be active. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.05 am): The Bligh government is all about jobs and growing strong local economies. We know that in uncertain economic times there are few things more important than jobs and job security. Our road building crews in Main Roads have their hard hats on at hundreds of road construction sites across our great state. While they are working in small towns and communities they are spending money at local shops and businesses, strengthening local economies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002176"></A>
Where does it all begin? In training and education. My department has opened up job opportunities for Indigenous trainees and apprentices in road construction right across our great state. Last year we provided training for around 70 Indigenous trainees in Cape York and Torres Strait. They have used these skills to work on infrastructure projects in their own communities, including sealing almost 40 kilometres of road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002177"></A>
Another initiative, our Education Towards Employment Scholarship Scheme, is helping young Indigenous students complete their year 12 schooling. We are giving them a better, brighter future. The scheme supports young Indigenous kids with leadership potential. It is also about creating role models for other kids. The students get a $5,000 scholarship, mentoring support and in some cases they can take part in work experience with linkages to apprenticeships, traineeships and cadetships. The scheme has been expanded. We are sponsoring 80 students this year. When we started in 1999 there were three student scholarships. Over that time, more than 420 students have successfully completed year 12. More than 2,300 Indigenous youth have applied for scholarships. That is a testament to the success of our program. In South-East Queensland we have got the Constructive Mob. It is about delivering better opportunities for Indigenous people and boosting their numbers in the construction industry. They have had the opportunity to complete a Certificate II in Civil Construction and at the same they have gained valuable hands-on experience on actual road construction sites.The Bligh government looks after all Queenslanders across our great state no matter where they live. We will continue to reach out to young Indigenous kids to give them the skills and education they need to get ahead in life. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.07 am): The new Local Government Act 2009, which comes into effect on 1 July, requires councils across Queensland to develop a community plan as part of their overall planning process. This plan clearly sets out the aspirations and priorities of the community. These plans are hands-on, strategic frameworks underpinning the long-term sustainability of councils. They will play an important role in guiding and shaping land use plans, corporate plans and town plans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002181"></A>
 Community plans reflect a community’s priorities in a whole range of areas, such as provision of services for seniors, planning for economic opportunities of the future and improved sporting and recreational facilities. Importantly, community plans are built on broad community consultation and engagement ensuring locals have input into their own future. Community plans are an opportunity for councils to think strategically about their entire region as well as ensuring communities with a special identity and special values are retained. Examples of such communities are places like Maleny, Port Douglas, Stanthorpe and Noosa. Having a community plan which demonstrates how the priorities of the residents of such areas are translated into an operational and works plan by the council will no doubt be welcomed by residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003510"></A>
New Zealand first introduced community plans in 2002, so they have had time to review their implementation. At the end of January, at the invitation of the Local Government Association of Queensland, I travelled to New Zealand with members of LGAQ’s executive and my deputy director-general to see firsthand how community plans are working there. I met with the New Zealand Local Government Minister, Rodney Hide, representatives from the Department of Internal Affairs who are responsible for local government, as well as representatives from Wellington City Council, Masterton District Council and South Wairarapa District Council. Each of those stakeholders bought a different perspective to the community planning discussion--perspectives that reflected the different demographic, geographic, financial and social factors impacting on individual councils.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003519"></A>
It is clear that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to community planning. This awareness will definitely guide our implementation of the community planning process here in Queensland. It is important that processes are flexible enough to be useful for the diversity of Queensland’s local councils, from the Diamantina Shire Council to the Bundaberg Regional Council, the Gold Coast City Council and all of the 73 local governments. The local government reform program is evidence of the Bligh government’s continuing commitment to local government and to building a strong Queensland for the future. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.10 am): This morning I rise to clarify some reports regarding the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project as outlined in today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
. The Gold Coast Rapid Transit project is a unique nation-building project being delivered by the Queensland government in partnership with the Australian government and the Gold Coast City Council. All of the modelling suggests that without the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project there will be gridlock on the Gold Coast. Therefore, we are undertaking a project that will substantially increase the rate of public transport patronage in that growing part of South-East Queensland. Early works on the first stage of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project have already started between Griffith University and Broadbeach, and that stage of the project will be operational by 2014. Planning is also underway for the next stage of the project between Griffith University and Helensvale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003524"></A>
Yesterday, on the recommendation of the local member, the Gold Coast City Council and the Gold Coast Rapid Transit team, I approved the H1 option linking Helensvale and Griffith University via the Harbour Town shopping centre. Contrary to reports in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 this morning, this announcement provides a greater level of certainty for residents. There is now one route to connect Helensvale and Griffith University, not the two that were previously being considered. During consultation in 2006-07, 83 per cent of people surveyed said that they preferred the Harbour Town route option. Early planning indicates that the subject of the news story in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
, Mr Gordon Taylor, will not be impacted upon by the proposed route. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003526"></A>
The next step is for more consultation with residents, along with more detailed planning around engineering and property impacts. Hardship acquisitions will be available for those directly impacted by the route, which was first mooted some years ago. Construction on this stage of project is not expected to start until at least 2014 and residents will be consulted at every step of the way. The Bligh government remains passionately committed not just to building this stage of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project but also to planning a sustainable public transport system for the Gold Coast’s future. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.13 am): During the last sitting I was pleased to advise the House that construction of the Airport Link, Northern Busway and airport roundabout upgrade projects were well underway. When complete, Australia’s largest infrastructure project will slash travel times for motorists and public transport patrons in a city currently experiencing some of the country’s worst peak-hour traffic. I am aware that Airport Link construction work is impacting residents near the nine major work sites from Bowen Hills through to Lutwyche, Windsor, Kedron, Clayfield and Toombul. In recent weeks, I have again met with affected residents and heard firsthand the toll this project is taking. I would like to inform residents and the House that the government will continue to take every mitigation measure possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003535"></A>
The state government will continue to investigate any possible breaches of the independent Coordinator-General’s strict construction conditions, which include noise and light restrictions and spoil truck regulations. If breaches are detected, penalties will follow. I understand the Department of Environment and Resource Management is continuing to monitor project activities to ensure the Coordinator-General’s strict dust restriction conditions are being enforced. An investigation into an incident involving after-hours work at Wooloowin recently led to the Coordinator-General issuing a show-cause notice on 18 January. A warning has also been issued after complaints were received near the Toombul work site. In addition, the Department of Transport and Main Roads has undertaken safety checks on the many vehicles hauling spoil from project sites. This too will continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003537"></A>
I take this opportunity to inform the residents of Lamington Avenue, Lutwyche, that Airport Link trucks will soon be using an alternative route to reduce noise and other impacts. However, not all impacts can be mitigated. Despite fitting 250 homes with mitigation devices such as air conditioning or double glazing, and the installation of noise walls and acoustic sheds, the state government has purchased or offered to purchase more than 12 extra properties whose owners are finding the impacts too difficult to endure. When complete, this project will slash travel times for the whole Brisbane community. Once again I would like to respectfully thank the residents of the inner north side and ask for their continued patience. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.16 am): The Office of Fair Trading has joined forces with a Cairns Indigenous consumer group to give remote Far North communities a dedicated person to turn to on consumer issues. The Office of Fair Trading will partner with the Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network, ICAN, and deploy specially trained officers to Yarrabah and Palm Island. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003542"></A>
Remote Indigenous communities can often be the target of unscrupulous businesses, due to their isolation and lack of marketplace competitiveness. For example, just last week hundreds of Far North Queenslanders entered into costly and unfair contracts after a household goods rental firm doorknocked local homes. Consumers have extra rights when approached by door-to-door sellers and they also have other options to get household goods without incurring massive debts for years. However, those are the types of things that people might not always be aware of. In this recent case, ICAN was able to pass on information from the affected consumers. The Office of Fair Trading then investigated and got the firm to cancel all 800 of the rental contracts and pay back in excess of $13,000 it had obtained from the residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003543"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading wants to prevent similar incidents happening in the first place, but recognises the Indigenous community did not traditionally lodge consumer complaints. We need to change this situation, which is why we are training seven ICAN staff in fair trading matters. They will work on the ground within the community and be armed with even more knowledge and skills to help protect the rights of residents and, where necessary, pass on information to the Office of Fair Trading for enforcement action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003544"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading has provided funding for ICAN services for two years as part of its 2009-10 Indigenous strategy. The strategy also includes an Indigenous consumer campaign called Know Your Rights, which will start in March with ads appearing on radio and print publications over the coming months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003545"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples. All the opposition leader and the LNP are doing for Indigenous people is labelling them and their traditions as living fossils, as we will recall. If members want further evidence of that, they need look no further than yesterday’s debate on the preamble to the Constitution. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.18 am): I am pleased to announce a trial of new technology to assist the kangaroo industry in Queensland. Currently, kangaroo harvesters use a paper based trace-back system, but overseas markets, including the European Union, are demanding improved traceability. With this in mind, we will conduct field trials on two different identification tags to track kangaroos from the time they are harvested until they arrive at the processing factory. The first trial, supported by $61,000 in state government funding, will use a radio frequency identification device. This sort of technology is already used in Australia to identify casino gambling chips, but this will be the first time it is used for kangaroo and wild game harvesting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003587"></A>
The identification tag is fixed to the animal and records specific information about each kangaroo including time, date and GPS location of harvest. It also has the capability of collecting detail such as the sex and species of kangaroo. The two-month trial will begin in southern Queensland in March this year and will involve Ipswich based Game Meat Processing and a number of local kangaroo harvesters and field depots. DEEDI will supply an economist to look at the true economic advantages. Meantime, Safe Food Production Queensland will trial a tag that uses bar code technology already used in the red meat industry. The tag will capture the time and date from various stages throughout the supply chain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003594"></A>
We want to develop one cost-effective tag that will suit the requirements of all agencies and restore access to overseas markets. As well as improving traceabilities, the tag could potentially cut a lot of paperwork and improve harvesting practices. Industry stakeholders, including harvesters, processors and regulators, are supporting the trial because of the possibilities the tag offers for opening market access and lowering costs. The Bligh government is about supporting industry, protecting and creating jobs and building stronger rural and regional communities. A viable kangaroo industry will help us achieve that goal. I seek leave to table for the benefit of members an example of the radio frequency tag. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.21 am): The Bligh government has a demonstrated track record of boosting the number of front-line officers in the Queensland Police Service. Since Labor came to power, the number of police officers in Queensland has skyrocketed by more than 50 per cent, from 6,800 in June 1998 to more than 10,400 today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003602"></A>
Reinforcing our commitment is our promise to employ a minimum of 600 additional front-line officers within the service during this term, and we are delivering on that promise. However, the government and the Police Service have also been able to boost front-line numbers through civilianisation. Employing civilian staff members to undertake tasks which do not require police powers means sworn police officers can be deployed back to the front line of policing. The Queensland Police Service currently employs 275 civilian communications room operators, 100 watch-house officers and 105 station client service officers across the state. That is 480 positions in total. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003606"></A>
At one station I visited recently one trained client service officer staffing the front desk had resulted in 19 extra operational police shifts every 28 days. That is 228 shifts per year available for a uniformed officer to work in the community responding to calls and patrolling our streets--clear evidence that civilianisation is paying dividends for the Queensland Police Service and the community at large. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003608"></A>
I am pleased to be able to announce today that the Queensland Police Service has identified a further 59 positions across the state where a civilian will be employed, allowing the sworn police officers to be redeployed to front-line services. These positions relate mainly to the functions of communications, watch-houses, station client services and prosecutions. Six of the positions are in the far northern region; five in the northern region; nine in the central region; four in metropolitan north; eight each in metropolitan south, north coast and south-eastern regions; five in the southern region; and four in the state operations command, with two positions still to be allocated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003611"></A>
Trained civilians, under the supervision of sworn police officers, provide a significant resource to policing in Queensland. I congratulate the Police Commissioner and his senior executive for identifying these additional positions for civilianisation as a part of their commitment to keeping Queensland safe. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.23 am): The Bligh government is committed to increasing the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Queensland democracy. Yesterday we witnessed the inclusion of the landmark preamble to the Queensland Constitution. Today I am pleased to announce the 2010 Young Indigenous Leaders Forum will be held in Brisbane from 30 May to 5 June, and that will incorporate an Indigenous Youth Parliament. I encourage all members to spot talent in their local area and encourage young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to take up this opportunity to be involved in the Indigenous Youth Parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003619"></A>
The Young Indigenous Leaders Forum will support and encourage the development of future Indigenous leaders. It is an important commitment that was made as part of the Premier’s Reconciliation Action Plan. Young participants will learn about the history of our parliament and gain an insight into democracy and the workings of the House. Participants will be taking over Parliament House for a few days. Forty seats will be earmarked for young Indigenous people passionate about making a difference. These young people are the decision makers of the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003624"></A>
The forum is an important step towards reconciliation and it also supports the ambitions of the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 plan for a fairer Queensland. The inaugural 2009 Indigenous Youth Parliament was inspirational, and I look forward to meeting the 2010 participants. Past participants have said that the Indigenous Youth Parliament was very inspirational and motivating for them. They have been spreading the word around their communities that it is a chance to share stories from their community and learn how to lead. On the day it was held in this chamber I was certainly very moved. I encourage all members not only to spot talent in their local area but to come down and witness these young people in action. </Hansard-Body>

Go Card</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003630"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.25 am): The go card is continuing its rollout across the South-East Queensland TransLink network. This week for the first time the go card is expected to be used to make more than two million trips across the TransLink network. Since 4 January, 150,000 go cards have been issued through more than 400 go card retailers across the south east as well, of course, by people ringing 131230 or buying a go card over the net. This is yet another important milestone for our go card, making it the most used smart card in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003635"></A>
The go card is consistently surpassing expectations and forecasts. Since it was rolled out in 2008, more than 72 million trips have been made on a go card and more than $187 million has been loaded on to the smart cards. Today, over half of all public transport trips are taken using a go card and, with students returning to university campuses through this week, it is clear that the record number of customers touching on and off will continue to rise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003636"></A>
These are all encouraging signs because the go card is providing enormous time savings for commuters. If you catch a bus, as almost 400,000 people do each day, it takes three seconds to touch on and off with a go card as opposed to on average 11 seconds to board and pay the driver whilst fishing around for change. Go cards are also increasingly capturing vital information which gives TransLink accurate data on passenger movements which helps to better plan and improve the network. This is a much more cost-effective way to address crowding as TransLink is able to target hot spots down to an individual stop or station level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003638"></A>
It is early days, but this new level of data is already being used to begin improving bus services, such as the additional 20,000 seats a week back-to-uni package that began operating on Monday. Ultimately, a paperless public transport system will deliver information which will help maximise every public dollar and every dollar in fare spent by government and by commuters in the south east. </Hansard-Body>

Credit Rating</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005271"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Treasurer. Three days before the state election was called, credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s wrote with concerns about Treasury debt, asking, ‘How does the government plan to address the deteriorating operating position?’ What did the government tell the credit rating agency, and will the Treasurer reveal if and why the government raised privatisation options with the agency before telling Queenslanders?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005274"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The reason the Leader of the Opposition is able to reference meetings that occurred with credit rating agencies is that I provided all of that information to him. The complete government record about the interaction with the credit rating agencies has been provided in full to the Leader of the Opposition under our nation-leading right to information laws. Nevertheless, even though we provided all of that information, he clearly has not read through it all, or if he has--in the world of the LNP conspiracy theory--he wants it to amount to something else. The reality is very clear. Let me go through it again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005275"></A>
This government, unlike any other government in the history of Queensland, published in full the details of the state’s finances before the calling of the last election, as we had committed to do--and as every future government of Queensland will be committed to do if the LNP decides to vote for the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill that sits on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 right now. The question is: does the LNP offer support to pass that bill through this parliament and therefore commit itself to what we as a government did, despite the law not providing for it, in providing a full update of the state’s finances? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005276"></A>
What did we say to the credit rating agencies, as we have said to them each and every time we have met with them? We go through in detail the state’s finances, and all of that information has been provided to the Leader of the Opposition. Yet again, despite the fact that we have handed it all over, what have opposition members done with it? Have they decided to use it to create one economic policy? Have they decided to look through it to come up with one idea?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005277"></A>
What we said to them was that we were committed to making sure we charted a course for the future strength of the state’s finances, and the answer to your question in one word is ‘no’. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has been provided with the details of that meeting and therefore he has the evidence of why that is the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005278"></A>
So the test is this: now that we have provided you with all of that information, now that we have done a great deal of the homework for you, now that we have put it all together, put a dog clip on it and mailed it to you, what are you going to do with it? Are you going to utilise it to come up with one idea or one policy, or are you going to stick to the same old policy that you have always pursued of talking about your wholesale privatisation agenda--it extends to schools, hospitals and far beyond what you have been prepared to admit in the public arena--as you scrunch yourself up into a little ball and pretend that you have no obligation to put forward policies of your own. Now that we have provided him with the homework, it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to do his own work. The reality is that the LNP has not produced one ounce of work and one policy that it would take Queensland forward with.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Minister for Transport. The minister has revealed that she was unaware of the government’s plans to sell Queensland Rail until after those plans were revealed in the media. Will the minister advise when she was first told that her department was planning a Brisbane metropolitan congestion charge for motorists of 30c a kilometre--a congestion charge for motorists on top of registration increases and a new fuel tax? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005288"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This government and my department have a comprehensive plan for South-East Queensland and in particular its transport future, and that plan involves these things: building better rail in the outer metropolitan areas of the city, like extending rail to the Gold Coast, down towards the member for Southport’s part of the world--</Hansard-Body>

 interjected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005291"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Southport as well will benefit. The government’s plan involves extending rail to Richlands and it involves building better busways in the inner city, like the Eastern Busway and the Northern Busway, which are currently under construction. The government’s plan involves providing more trains, more buses and more ferries on that public transport network--like, for instance, the 20,000 extra seats that rolled out just this week, starting from Monday. This government’s plan is comprehensive and is being delivered right now.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005292"></A>
Further, as has been said on the record before, this government does not plan to introduce a change in pricing such as a congestion charge. We have a comprehensive policy and we are building it and rolling it out right now. I am sure, for instance, that the Minister for Main Roads would be more than happy to tell the House about the comprehensive road elements of the transport plan. The real issue for this House is what the LNP would do. The LNP went to the last election with a nonsensical transport policy. First, the LNP proposed a railway line on the Sunshine Coast which did not join in to the broader network. There will be no--</Hansard-Body>

 I just want to respond to the member for Maroochydore’s interjection: there will be no congestion charge. Instead, we have a comprehensive plan to build better public transport and better roads. That is in stark contrast to the LNP, which planned for an unfunded Petrie to Kippa-Ring railway line and a railway line on the Sunshine Coast which does not join up.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Could the Premier please update the House on her government’s latest initiatives to give kids a flying start to their reading? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005300"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. I know how much he enjoys reading with his own son, George, and how much he understands that reading is a critical obligation of parenthood. We know that research shows that reading just one book a day--just one small children’s book a day--to a child can have a very positive impact on their literacy and on their development. We know that children’s brains develop very rapidly in their early years, so there are endless chances for them to learn new skills. It is those early years when we have to set the foundations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005302"></A>
Literacy and numeracy start at home. In our schools, we want to see the literacy and numeracy performance of our students boosted. That is why the Minister for Education, his department and the other sectors of schooling are all putting extra effort into literacy and numeracy initiatives, with extra resources into schools, particularly those that need it most.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005304"></A>
But we also know that the efforts of our schools will be significantly improved if what happens for children before they come to school can have a focus on learning and on literacy. That is why the <Hansard-Italic>
A flying start for Queensland children</Hansard-Italic>
 discussion paper which the minister and I launched starts with the basics, and it starts with a focus on the early years. We know from the first comprehensive national survey ever done of early childhood development in Australia, which was published near the end of last year, that around 70 per cent of Australian parents are regularly reading to their children at home. Unfortunately, for a range of reasons, that figure is somewhat lower in Queensland, with 61 per cent of parents on average reading to their children at home. We want to see that figure lifted. I want to see more Queensland parents than any other state reading to their children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005305"></A>
We also know that increasingly parents right across Australia are very busy. We know that there are more and more families in which both parents are in the workforce, either full time or part time, and that often makes the responsibilities of parenting a very big juggle for people. That is why we think it is time to be out there in the public arena promoting the importance of reading. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005308"></A>
Mr Speaker, you will see this week the start of a major social marketing campaign on the importance of reading for parents. It will be accompanied in Townsville, in the central Fraser Coast area and Toowoomba with a campaign to kick-start our reading volunteer program in schools. Every single one of these initiatives links with the next--getting it right at home, then putting in kindies which meet up with the prep year, then having literacy and numeracy initiatives in our classrooms. It is a connected continuum. Every single part of it is important in terms of getting the results we want for our children. We want our children to have a flying start, and it is programs like this that will deliver it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Transport. I refer to Connecting SEQ 2031 and transport department planning documents which propose a 30c per kilometre Brisbane congestion tax. Why does the plan assume that in Brisbane by 2031 the number of car trips will decrease from 2.7 million trips a day to 2.4 million? What would cause such a decrease if Labor had not already secretly committed to imposing a congestion tax on motorists? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006728"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is governments that make decisions, it is members of the cabinet who set the direction, and this government will not introduce a congestion charge. What this government will do is build better public transport and a better road network in South-East Queensland and right across the state. That is what we are doing right now. There are workers right now who are building a better public transport network. Do you know why they are doing it, Mr Speaker? They are doing it because this government has decided that that is our priority and this government has funded that infrastructure which creates those jobs which makes for a better quality of life for these people who live in this state right now. That is the decision that this government has made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006730"></A>
Where would we be if the LNP had fallen over the line at the last election? I can tell you where we would be, Mr Speaker. There would be some sort of chaos about how exactly it is that you construct a railway line on the Sunshine Coast that does not join up with the broader network. We would have got past the election and all the people who live around Redcliffe would have realised that, when the member for Maroochydore went up there in the first week of the last election campaign and promised them that she would deliver the much vaunted Redcliffe railway line, she did not mean it. With an asterisk and in small print she meant, ‘Maybe only if things go okay with the global financial crisis’, ‘Subject to the global financial crisis.’ That is where we would be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006732"></A>
This government makes the decisions. Our decision is to build a better public transport network. We make tough economic decisions in order to keep doing that, and this stands in very stark contrast to those opposite whose only economic plan was to cut services and jobs, and whose transport plan in many respects did not even join up. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I think it is important for us to acknowledge what has happened in the Queensland economy over the last 12 months. This time last year we faced the most dire of circumstances, along with the Australian economy and many jurisdictions around the world. Our government has put in place some tough decisions, and they are starting to repay benefits and dividends for the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006738"></A>
In just 12 months what we have experienced is now six months of consecutive job creation--more than 18,000 jobs created in the last six months. Employment figures are starting to turn around. We expected unemployment to peak this year at at least 6 per cent. It is now down to 5.8 per cent. As the Treasurer outlined yesterday, the gross state product for the September quarter saw growth of one per cent. Importantly, predictions from Access Economics are that the Queensland economy will grow at a rate of 2.7 per cent this financial year--faster than the national rate of one per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006740"></A>
Why is that working? It is working because we made the decision to keep building. What did that decision mean? It meant that we kept jobs and we kept skills in our economy. Those skills and those jobs are driving the beginnings of economic recovery. Some of the things we are building have been outlined this morning by the Minister for Transport. We are not only building big projects in the transport sector that are providing jobs when we need it most but also putting in place transport facilities in the south-east and in other parts of the state that will drive productivity in the economy this year, next year and the year after.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006743"></A>
I note a number of questions this morning in relation to future transport planning. In relation to current thinking in the government around transport planning, let me say that the documents that are being referred to this morning are documents that have been developed by some people in the department of transport. Let us talk about what the government did with those documents. I required those documents to be brought to cabinet so that government could make a decision on them. You know what we decided? We decided not to adopt the recommendations. We said, ‘This is not good enough. We will not accept this advice. We do not support a congestion charge.’ </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading. I refer to the minister’s responsibility to protect Queenslanders from Labor’s deadly Home Insulation Program. Will the minister tell the House how many shonky installers have been prosecuted, how many house fires have been linked to shonky installation and how many of the 1,000 Australian homes with deadly electrified roofs are in Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006756"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. With regard to the reports that we see in the media, the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Water Heritage and the Arts is responsible for the administration of the homeowner and insulation protection program. It is part of its $4.5 billion package that aims to improve the energy efficiency of Australian homes, as we are aware. The situation is that on 19 February 2010--a few weeks ago--the federal government announced the closure of the home insulation and hot water rebate schemes. As part of the ongoing consumer protection role, the Queensland Office of Fair Trading receives and considers complaints against insulation installers. A memorandum of understanding between the Office of Fair Trading and the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Water Heritage and the Arts has been established to enable the Office of Fair Trading to provide details of complaints received against registered insulation installers to that department.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006763"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading has finalised 208 complaints regarding insulation since January 2009. Those complaints received by the Office of Fair Trading cover a broad spectrum of consumer issues, as members would expect. They include simple requests for assistance to obtain refunds, repairs, replacement and warranty issues, complaints about installers including the workmanship involved with installation and approaches made by traders offering to install products. The cost has also been an issue. There have been allegations the installers were overcharging in order to collect a full rebate. There were also concerns raised about safety issues, in particular regarding downlights and foil insulation. They amounted to five complaints. Details of all complaints, including those five complaints, have been provided to the federal Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts or referred to the appropriate regulatory agencies where they are involved. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I have indicated before that one of the great challenges we have in health is an ageing population and the ever-increasing expectations of that ageing population. For example, off the top of my head, in 1984-05 we did about 32,000 hip and knee replacements in Australia. About 12 years later we did 72,000. In that period I do not think anyone could suggest that people’s knees and hips got worse. The expectation of people for surgery and those sorts of things increases, as it necessarily will, over time because we want to provide better and better outcomes. </Hansard-Body>

One of the areas where we are committed to real action is the area of mental health. Mental illness or chronic ill-health is not the leading killer of people in Australia, but it is one of the leading areas when it comes to lost wages or lost time from work. We have a mental health plan. We take our mental health and wellbeing very seriously. We have invested in a 10-year plan. Since July 2007, $617.43 million has been invested in community mental health. We have funded 422 extra equivalent positions in nursing and allied health, 65 medical officers and 93 technical, operational and support staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008419"></A>
But who could forget the last election and the wonderful volunteer policy of the opposition. It was that we will have volunteers in mental health dealing with mental health records. That was one of its purlers. That was up there in the pantheon of LNP policies with the railway line that did not connect into anything and the asterisk. We have the member for Caloundra and his absolute purler--mental health records, the most sensitive things we can have, being maintained by volunteers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008420"></A>
One of the things about volunteering is that you have to opt in. The opposition does not know much about opting in but it knows a hell of a lot about opting out. We have the Leader of the Opposition, who is no doubt the weakest Leader of the Opposition in the time that I have been here, opting out of a reshuffle that he promised to do. He has opted out of taking action against the member for Moggill, the member for Noosa and--who was the other one in it--the member for Mermaid Beach, the little water, the little mermaid water. But he took action against the member for Burnett and the member for Beaudesert. He opted out of any policy platform despite the fact that he said it. He opted out of a reshuffle despite the fact that he said that he would do it before Christmas. Worst of all, he opted out of any role for liberalism in the parliamentary Liberal Party in this state. There is no liberalism, there is no freedom of thought in his party and no policy either. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Australia-wide mass sacking of insulation workers by the Labor Party. Treasurer, exactly how many Queenslanders were sacked or are about to be sacked by Labor, and what is the tally for jobs lost in Queensland as a result of the cancellation of the scheme? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008430"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and for his feigned concern for the interests of working people in Queensland. The reality is that given the decisions that have been made by the Commonwealth there are obviously ramifications that will occur in that industry. The federal government has been clear about the fact, for instance, that it will provide $10 million in support to those workers as any decent Labor government would do. Secondly, it has also indicated, through its employment participation minister, that it will be fast-tracking support to affected workers not only in Queensland but right around Australia. That is the responsible course of action for a Labor government to undertake when a decision such as this arises. It is a response that has been pursued by the federal Labor government at a national level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008432"></A>
However, to walk into this chamber and to feign concern for the interests of workers shows the rank hypocrisy of the LNP. What we see, of course, in the last couple of weeks, just as the shadow Treasurer now seeks to cuddle up to the cause of workers’ rights, is the Leader of the Opposition federally seeking to recuddle up to the concept of Work Choices. The reality is this. What we see from the Liberals federally and what we see from the LNP at a state level is an absolute commitment to the same old failed policies of the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008434"></A>
So the real question for the shadow Treasurer is this: where does he stand on bringing back Work Choices? Where does the shadow Treasurer stand on bringing back the worst parts of Work Choices--the single biggest attack on the interests and the rights of working people around Queensland and indeed around the nation? When he comes in here and sets out his policy position on what he believes in terms of bringing back Work Choices and opposes those most heinous parts of Work Choices which have been put back on the agenda by Tony Abbott as opposition leader, then he has every right to feign concern for the interests of the workers of Queensland. He has no right to feign concern for the interests of working people, just as all other members of the LNP in this chamber do not, until he states his position on bringing back Work Choices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008437"></A>
What are we doing? We are making sure that we have an industrial relations system that supports workers. What are we doing? We are providing support, like our $101 million commitment to the Skilling Queenslanders for Work initiative, to get people in work and keep people in work. Our new $10 million JobsAssist program has helped nearly 1,000 businesses in this state to help people stay in work. What is this government committed to doing? Making the tough choices to fund employment programs, to put forward industry development programs, to run schemes that support new and emerging industries. We have the courage to make the decisions, to make the choices and to support working people in this state. I just say to the workers of Queensland: watch what these folk are up to and ask them where they stand on bringing back Work Choices. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
I thank the member for Waterford for his question and for his interest in the Skilling Queenslanders for Work initiative--our $101 million commitment that we maintain to help Queenslanders break into the workforce. I know that it is program that he has a strong personal interest in in his local area. He puts the time and effort into making sure that those Queenslanders who need the assistance of government can get access to that assistance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008486"></A>
Right now a number of success stories are being featured on regional television through the Win network--success stories from our Get Set for Work program, like Emiliese Anderson, who has broken into the labour market in Cairns for the first time with the assistance of the Queensland government’s employment programs. I refer to success stories like Clinton ‘Cuz’ Woodbridge from Goondiwindi who has got his dream job--‘Cuz’ has got his dream job--as a police liaison officer with support and assistance in the literacy program that has helped him secure employment and helped him chart a course for not only himself but indeed his future family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008490"></A>
Those are the success stories that we are interested in as we make the tough decisions to keep funding the employment programs that support Queenslanders who need it. But of course what I remain committed to is finding out the alternatives being offered by the opposition. So imagine my anticipation when I came across an article in that journal of record the <Hansard-Italic>

 in the last couple of days titled ‘Shadow treasurer casts light on future’. The anticipation built but quickly deflated. I read the first paragraph, which starts with--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008501"></A>
I know the shadow Treasurer has been struggling with the company he has had to keep in here in the last couple of weeks, but even I was pretty surprised that he would choose to haul around on the northern downs with the member for Condamine and Senator Barnaby Joyce just waiting for a tidbit of wisdom or a tidbit of policy to drop off the table from Senator Joyce about what it might take to run the economy of Queensland in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008504"></A>
But my anticipation was well placed, because he did propose an idea. The shadow Treasurer has come up with an idea: he thinks the state of Queensland needs to establish a ‘sovereign well fund’. I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he actually meant ‘sovereign wealth fund’, but the big news flash is this: in 1991 this parliament authorised the creation of QIC, a sovereign wealth fund, which you can find on the internet in reports on sovereign wealth funds. Or if you do not want to read those, you can even go to--would you believe?--sovereign funds central and find QIC listed. The reality is that they need to come up with a policy, because this article does not quite cut the mustard.</Hansard-Body>

Solar Hot Water Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008513"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Treasurer and Minister for Employment. When the Premier announced her election commitment of 200,000 solar hot-water systems, she promised it would create 500 jobs. Can the Treasurer advise how many jobs have been lost and what is the government’s response for the tradesmen and contractors who have lost work because of the collapse of this failed election promise?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008517"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow minister for his question and for his concern in ensuring that this government continues to support programs that not only support industries of the future like solar hot water and LNG but do so in a way that creates skills for the future workers of Queensland. Our commitment to running these programs remains unchanged. However, the reality--as the Minister for Energy has been clear, as the Premier has been clear and indeed as all members of the cabinet have been clear--is that the changes that were decided upon by the federal government last Friday do present challenges for us and the institution of our program. We are presently dealing with those issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008520"></A>
The reality is that this government remains committed to its election commitment on delivering a Solar Hot Water Program, and we remain committed to delivering a Solar Hot Water Program because not only is it good for developing a new industry and not only is it good for creating jobs of the future but also it is providing a tangible benefit to those people who get the benefit of this program, not only in terms of their carbon footprint but most importantly in making sure that their energy bills are reduced. That is why we remain utterly committed to ensuring that we deliver a program that supports the solar hot-water industry in this state. What we want to see is this industry grow into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008523"></A>
What we have not seen from the opposition is any identification that it would fund this program or indeed any other program, because it remains committed to the old days. When it was last in government, what did it do in terms of employment programs? We all remember that former minister for employment Santo Santoro abolished the department of employment. So committed to job creation is it that its record is that it abolished the employment department. So committed is it to job creation in this state, as all members on this side of the House know, that the current status of the jobs target the LNP has in this state is zero--right there beside how many policies it has put forward, and that is zero. Until those opposite come in here and disown the old policies of job cuts, as they remained committed to in the weekend’s press, until they come in here and put forward a proposition about what they would do and until they come in here and put forward a positive plan for what choices they would make--the decisions they would make--then their feigned concern in here is seen through by every member of this chamber and those watching from outside.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008526"></A>
While they are sitting down doing nothing and creating no policies, their do-nothing plan condemns this state to an extra $25 billion of debt. Until they can confront the reality of making choices, making decisions and putting forward policies, then the idea that these are the people to chart a course for the future of Queensland to concentrate on providing job opportunities is one that is seen through by everyone in this chamber and everyone outside.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. With millions of motorists driving on South-East Queensland motorways every day, can the minister please advise the House what steps are being taken to help keep our state-of-the-art motorways clean and tidy?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for Springwood for her question. She is a regular user of our motorways, as is the member for Albert. I constantly get comments from motorists about the rubbish on our motorways. I wish I had better news, but, unfortunately, motorists are continuing to dump rubbish on our motorways. We embarked on a major clean-up campaign across our motorways in South-East Queensland earlier this year. We put on extra crews after the peak Christmas holiday period, one of the busiest times on our roads. They have picked up everything from fast-food wrappings to glass, plastic bottles and car parts--even furniture and old fridges. We have had a number of work crews, made up of people doing community service to pay off their fines, out there cleaning up debris and removing rubbish from our motorways.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008538"></A>
It costs around $1 million a year to keep our motorways in tiptop shape, but every dollar spent removing rubbish from our motorways is a dollar that is not being spent on our roads and road safety. Motorists in Brisbane threw away more than 2,000 cubic metres of garbage onto our motorways last year. That is almost enough to fill an Olympic sized swimming pool. It is just not good enough. Around 1,500 cubic metres of mess was removed from the M1 alone last year. More than $1.6 million was spent on rubbish removal in the Main Roads north coast region last financial year. Of that, around $600,000 was spent on cleaning up the National Highway and more than $1 million on other state controlled roads in the region. More than $820,000 was spent last financial year removing rubbish and debris along the M1 between the member’s electorate of Springwood and Tugun on the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008544"></A>
Our road crews continually clean up South-East Queensland motorways so that all road users can travel on our roads safely. But today I urge motorists who throw caution to the wind, and everything else out the window, to think twice before littering our motorways. It is an offence by law and it is an offence to the majority of responsible motorists who also travel on our state’s roads and who do the right thing. Not only that, the money spent on clean-up costs--money that could be better spent upgrading our existing roads and networks and improving safety for Queenslanders--is wasted. If you are using our motorways, please ensure that you keep your rubbish inside the car. That way, we can have better roads. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Local Government. I refer to the statement today from the CEO of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council that hundreds of council jobs must go due to Labor’s forced amalgamations. What is the government doing to help those Sunshine Coast workers to support their families?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010499"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. It is a question that I am very pleased to answer, because thank heavens for the Bligh government and the deal struck with the unions, with the LGAQ and with the LGMA to protect local government jobs during the transition to amalgamations. We did not know at the time that that deal was struck that we were shortly to face the global financial crisis, with the huge pressure that has come to bear on employment in communities around Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010501"></A>
That local government jobs are protected through to March 2011 is undoubtedly providing some considerable comfort to all of those families who might otherwise fear that they would be on the unemployment market and competing for too short a supply of jobs in our current economy. Nonetheless, I understand that the CEO has said that, with the amalgamation on the Sunshine Coast, it has become apparent, in particular in middle management, that there are too many workers and that after the period whereby they were forced through the arrangements made by our Bligh government to keep employees there will be a review, as I understand it at the 2011-12 budget, of the job needs for the Sunshine Coast council. I respect that that is the CEO’s opinion. He is an excellent CEO. I also respect that he is giving his community fair warning of the circumstances that will arrive some 15 months from now. So the Bligh government has provided that comfort to workers in the local government field. </Hansard-Body>

Let us talk a little bit more about the Sunshine Coast council. Yesterday, I was pleased to see the mayor of the Sunshine Coast, Bob Abbot, along with many other mayors from around Queensland who are on the executive of the LGAQ, who came to meet with the Premier and me. Other councils that were represented at the meeting included the Bundaberg Regional Council--and I pay my regards to Mayor Lorraine Pyefinch--and other councillors who attended included Les Tyrell. There is no doubt that those mayors and their councils have stepped up to the challenge of amalgamation. And how! They have kept the jobs running. They have tackled it, even if it was not their personal view that the amalgamation should occur, absolutely strategically. They are saving money through the amalgamations and are honestly reflecting that while at the same time talking to our government about the challenges ahead. Yesterday at that meeting a new beginning in the partnership was struck with Bob Abbot and the Sunshine Coast council and the other councils represented on the executive and the LGAQ. </Hansard-Body>

 They can try to dismiss this. They stopped every capital works project in Queensland. What happened when the Borbidge government got elected? Things got a bit tough.

The reality is this: since we have come to government, if you go around to any of the electorates--for example, if you go to Cairns--you will hear the members representing the electorates in the Cairns area talking about the hospital there and the jobs that has created. You will hear them talk about the number of people in the other industries that are supported, such as at Lotus Glen that is up the road and all the subcontractors from Cairns who are up there. If you go to Townsville you will hear the members representing electorates in the Townsville area talk about what is happening at the hospital and the thousands of jobs that have been created. If you go to Mackay you will hear the member for Mackay talking about it. If you go to Rockhampton, you will hear the member representing that area talking about it and you will hear the member for Keppel talking about it as well. If you go to Maroochydore, what do you hear? Nothing. You would swear that there is nothing happening there. There is a $92 million government office building being built there, creating 640 jobs.

Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading. in a phone hook-up on 29 April 2009, officials from the Queensland Office of Fair Trading were warned about the federal government’s insulation scheme and the likelihood of unregistered operators and shonky operators leading to a forecast 10 per cent failure rate in the program. I ask: why did the minister not take any action on this warning to protect the lives of three young Queensland workers that could have been saved if he had launched immediate action? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member again for his question. I can only go through the information. I am unaware of the phone call that the member refers to. I can only go through the information that I have already provided, and that is basically that this is a federal government scheme. It was abolished as of 19 February, but it will be replaced by a new household Renewal Energy Bonus Scheme under which households will receive a $1,000 rebate. As part of the ongoing consumer protection role, the Queensland Office of Fair Trading receives and considers complaints against insulation installers. A memorandum of understanding exists between the Office of Fair Trading and the Commonwealth department to provide details of complaints received against the registered installers to that department. It is a federal government scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010531"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading has finalised 208 complaints regarding insulation since January 2009. Those complaints received by the Office of Fair Trading related to a multitude of issues, simple requests for assistance for refunds, complaints about installers’ workmanship, costs, allegations that installers were overcharging and also issues relating to safety. Details of those complaints are provided to the federal department. It is a federal government scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010532"></A>
The scheme commenced on 1 July 2009. The Office of Fair Trading has received 208 complaints since 1 January. Six months before the scheme came into being, 27 complaints were received regarding insulation. In the 7 months since the scheme commenced, there were 181 complaints regarding insulation. Of those insulation complaints, since 1 January--that is, before the scheme started--17 indicated some type of safety concern and of those six did not actually identify a safety matter. Six complaints, which consisted of consumer perception that the product or its installation may have been unsafe, were not correct. Five complaints actually indicated a safety concern. All five that indicated an actual safety concern were referred specifically to the federal department. One of those complaints involved a consumer who alleged that they had been electrocuted as a result of the insulation. That consumer had already lodged a complaint with the relevant Queensland government agency, the Department of Justice and Attorney-General. </Hansard-Body>

The unfortunate deaths of Queensland insulation installers by electrocution are matters being investigated by the Electrical Safety Office and Workplace Health and Safety in the Department of Justice and Attorney-General. </Hansard-Body>

Ms CROFT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading. Will the minister please tell the House how important the international market briefings held this week in Cairns and on the Gold Coast are for tourism?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012233"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. On Monday and Tuesday this week Tourism Queensland regional directors who look after Queensland’s key international markets, including Japan, the UK, New Zealand, North America, Europe, China, the Middle East, India and South-East Asia, travelled to Cairns and the Gold Coast from around the world to update the local tourism industries on the latest trends and issues affecting their markets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012234"></A>
From all reports, international travel in Queensland is looking up for 2010. The briefings give Tropical North Queensland and Gold Coast tourism operators market intelligence on Queensland’s key international tourism markets in 2010 straight from the horse’s mouth, effectively. There is a big year ahead of us, coming out of the global financial crisis and on the back of positive aviation news for Cairns and the Gold Coast in recent months. Feedback from our international markets is that things are looking positive for 2010, with a gradual return of consumer confidence. Earlier this month AirAsia X increased daily services between Kuala Lumpur and the Gold Coast. In addition, Tourism Queensland launched a $400,000 international tourism marketing campaign in early February encouraging Kiwis to cross the ditch. As part of the campaign this week, Tourism Queensland’s New Zealand office has been hosting some of New Zealand’s top radio presenters on the Gold Coast showing them the sights, sounds and exciting holiday experiences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012235"></A>
In the year to September 2009 the Gold Coast received 794,000 international visitors who spent more than a billion dollars on their trips. Tropical North Queensland received 667,000 international visitors who spent $919 million on their trips. Tourism is a major driver for the Tropical North and the Gold Coast economies. It is most important, now more than ever, that our industry works together. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012236"></A>
These market briefings are an important tool in enabling our operators to meet Tourism Queensland’s international regional directors and help them gain vital market intelligence. I would like to know what sort of intelligence there is in the LNP. They still have no policy on tourism. The only policy they have is to cut $12 million from the QIIS program and cut 12,000 jobs, which would have an adverse effect on various areas of the economy, including tourism.</Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Education. In light of the recent tragic events and other instances of children bringing knives to schools, what system has the minister put in place to ensure that students will remain in a safe environment whilst at school?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012241"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for this very important question. It is a very serious issue, and the challenges around it are shared equally by all three school sectors--that is, ensuring that we have the safest possible environment for our young children to be learning in a positive, creative and stimulating educational situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012242"></A>
The systems apply differently in the three school sectors. We in the state school sector, Education Queensland, have a very rigorous state-wide behaviour management policy that applies in each school. It is in the hands of the principal and the staff to ensure it is rigorously and thoroughly implemented. It is complemented by a code of good behaviour that is developed at the school level in consultation with the school P&amp;C and the broader school community and, indeed, within state education. I requested late last year, in the fourth quarter, that the behaviour management plans be updated and reviewed. That is in the process of being concluded across the 1,245 state schools, to ensure they adopt high community expectations about appropriate behaviour in schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012243"></A>
Make no mistake: this government--and I am sure all members here join with me--will not tolerate violence and inappropriate behaviour not only in state schools but in all schools. We will take all steps across the three school sectors to ensure that message is carried strongly to all students and to the broader community. As we know, there are some parents who do not respect high standards of behaviour in their interaction with schools and with teachers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012244"></A>
So important is this issue that we have set up, as was announced by the Premier and me yesterday, a very significant initiative--that is, an alliance across the three school sectors against student school violence. That alliance has the most senior people from the three sectors working together with senior representatives of all the key stakeholders, accessing Queensland Police, Child Safety and Communities. The key purpose of this is to identify where each school sector is carrying out world’s best practice and is implementing or has in practice right now good policies around violence in schools, bullying and cyberbullying. I look forward to a good report from this alliance.</Hansard-Body>

Recreational Fishing</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WETTENHALL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland. Could the minister please update the House on plans to update our knowledge of the state’s recreational fishing industry? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012249"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The honourable member knows the value of the recreational and commercial fishing sectors to the tourism industry, particularly in Cairns, which is a great mecca for people who gather there for both their recreational pursuits and the fine food that the commercial fishermen catch. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012250"></A>
With more than 700,000 people pursuing recreational fishing each year, we need new information about participation and what the catch is. To help determine the true worth of recreational fishing, more than 4,000 recreational fishers will take part in a telephone survey later this year. The survey will target a cross-section of Queenslanders for a period of 12 months. The last state-wide survey was conducted in 2004-05. What we need now is a more up-to-date picture so that we can be more informed in our policy areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012251"></A>
In the previous survey, 3,000 people participated using logbooks, but we will make it easier by using a telephone survey. We are investing over $500,000 in this survey. What the survey in 2004-05 showed was that there was a decline in recreational fishing, but this was a trend worldwide. What we do know is that since that period the environment in Queensland has changed dramatically. The population has grown by over 500,000 people since 2005, technology has produced better fishing methods and significant development has occurred in the coastal areas from the New South Wales border right up to Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012252"></A>
The state-wide survey in 2010-11 will focus on participation rates, where people fish and what people catch. In addition to that, we will finetune the data by conducting surveys at boat ramps which will provide finer detail. There is a definite advantage in carrying out the research in this way. The telephone interviewers will contact the participants on a regular basis, recording all their fishing activity. This same method of survey is internationally recognised. The jurisdictions of Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory are participating in a similar approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012253"></A>
For the first time, we have actually put a dollar value on the recreational sector. For 2009 we believe that the recreational sector was worth about $350 million to $420 million a year to the Queensland economy. That supports thousands of jobs across Queensland. We want to promote recreational fishing, protect jobs and ensure that recreational fishing is sustainable. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Leader of the Opposition has today given notice of a motion that is, in my view, unorthodox. It is unorthodox because it seeks to have the House express an opinion on a matter relating to the Premier, not in her capacity as a minister or member, but as president of a political party. I have considered whether a motion on such a subject is permissible or out of order.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018126"></A>
I note that questions to a minister about personal matters or about matters pertaining to their capacity as a member of a party are generally out of order, because they do not relate to the public affairs for which the minister is officially connected or to any matter of administration for which the minister is responsible. A notice of motion, on the other hand, is merely an incomplete motion, a proposal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018127"></A>
It is for the House to determine whether it will agree to the proposition. As long as the motion, if agreed to, would not offend the law and the notice is internally logical, coherent, and contains only facts necessary and able to be authenticated, it should not be interfered with. Therefore, the matter will be left to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (11.31 am), by leave: I rise to make some further comments in relation to a document that was mentioned during question time. The document is called Connecting SEQ 2031. The existence of this document is well known. In fact, I think it was referred to in the editorial of the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 this week. This is the planning document that the state government is working on with local councils in South-East Queensland to develop a better integrated transport plan for the south-east corner. As one would expect in the development of such a plan, a broad range of options are being canvassed by all involved. Also as one would expect, every possible issue is being explored and advice is being provided to government. This project has been led by the state government in partnership with the Council of Mayors. It was first put to the Council of Mayors in May 2008 and the Council of Mayors agreed that each affected council would second a council officer to the project. The project team represents good practice in terms of planning between state and council officers. </Hansard-Body>

This document was the subject of a presentation at the regional coordinating committee at which mayors Councillor Campbell Newman, John Brent, Paul Pisasale, Allan Sutherland and Bob Abbot were all present. A very open conversation was had. Does it represent government policy? I would draw the attention of members to a number of features of the document. What does it say at the bottom of just about every page? It is little wonder this document was not tabled, because it says ‘draft, not government policy’. Another page refers to ‘hypothetical strategy options’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018146"></A>
I can confirm for the House that cabinet has considered a preliminary draft of the document. Cabinet has ruled out and rejected any cordon charging, cordon tolling or congestion charging. I expect that cabinet will consider a number of versions of this document before it is finalised for a lengthy process of public consultation. I thank the Minister for Transport for the work that she is doing and for bringing this document to cabinet. This is part of the normal process of planning. We simply cannot get the planning for South-East Queensland transport right unless we work with the councils of South-East Queensland. We will do that in partnership because, unlike those opposite, this government will build the infrastructure needed today and tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.35 am): Today I rise to speak to the growing concern of violence in our schools. This is something that the LNP takes extremely serious and, as I have said previously, it is something that we believe should be addressed in a bipartisan way. Yesterday in this House, the Premier stood up to grandstand on the issue of school violence, but instead of taking action she chose to do nothing. Last week, I offered to work with the government on ways in which we can reduce violence in our schools. Sadly, that offer was turned down. Yesterday we saw nothing more than another exercise in spin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018158"></A>
In 2006, the Youth Violence Task Force was set up to address very similar issues as to those to be addressed by the Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence announced by the Premier yesterday. I ask the Premier: what has happened to the Youth Violence Task Force and what has happened to the 16 recommendations it handed down in 2007 to tackle youth violence? In the 52nd sitting of parliament I introduced into this House a private member’s bill to limit the supply of alcohol to minors. Even though the Youth Violence Task Force supported the purpose of my bill, the government voted it down only to come back into the House a year later and introduce it as its own bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018161"></A>
That is why today, as part of a plan to address violence in our schools, I table a copy of a consultation draft of a bill to amend the Criminal Code to introduce a series of offences relating to acts of violence on school grounds. The draft bill also seeks comment on a new offence that would seek to prevent violent fight clubs being conducted on school grounds. According to police statistics, there were 2,498 assaults reported on educational facilities between 2006 and 2009. Educational facilities had some of the highest recorded number of assaults in any institutional setting.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (11.37 am): Over a number of years I have had the terrific experience of working with a great bunch of women, the Toowoomba Maternity Coalition, in their quest for a birthing centre at the Toowoomba Hospital. This was an important election commitment for Toowoomba. It is great news that the $1 million redevelopment of the Toowoomba Hospital’s new birthing centre is in full swing with the appointment of a successful tenderer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018167"></A>
The redevelopment will see two new birthing suites constructed in the Toowoomba Hospital, adjacent to the maternity ward in an area occupied by the old decommissioned obstetric theatre. The $1 million redevelopment will provide a new birthing experience for the expectant mothers of Toowoomba and the Darling Downs. The new Toowoomba birthing centre will give low-risk pregnant women significantly enhanced birthing choices, including giving women the opportunity to give birth in a family homelike environment with midwife support and access to specialised care if required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018168"></A>
The state government is now working closely with the Toowoomba Maternity Coalition in the development of the new birthing centre. The Maternity Coalition does a tremendous job in working to enhance birthing choices for women locally. I am really pleased that it has continued to provide input into the development and design of the centre. This includes being involved as part of the birthing centre working group and steering committee, with both playing an integral role in the development of the new birthing centre. This consultation will help to further ensure that the design of the centre meets the needs of expectant mothers and the specialised midwifery nurses who will care for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018169"></A>
Over the past 12 months the Toowoomba Hospital has seen an increase of six per cent in the birthrate, which is consistent with what has been happening in Toowoomba over previous years. There is a strong midwifery model of care in place. Those highly trained midwives will ensure that local women have the birthing experience they choose, all the while knowing that the support, care and advice they need is right there. </Hansard-Body>

Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. The only thing Queenslanders can trust Labor on is that if they vote for Labor it is going to cost them dearly. I was going to table this document--it has been tabled--that shows that a congestion charge is in the government’s plans. What we see from the government is that it says one thing and does another. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018213"></A>
The government’s transport planning documents as part of Connecting SEQ 2031 show two things: a congestion charge and delayed public transport infrastructure. Queensland motorists are already paying the highest costs of any motorists in Australia. Commuters in SEQ are also suffering from a government that has plans but no action. In 2016 the rail network in the middle of Brisbane is due to hit gridlock. Like a scene from the movie <Hansard-Italic>
Groundhog Day</Hansard-Italic>
, Labor keeps reannouncing feasibility plans, with no action--14 April 2005, 26 August 2007, 7 October 2008, 12 May 2009 and 19 November 2009. In the next few weeks we will see another announcement about a feasibility study and yet another expensive PR campaign. Labor has the PR; it just does not follow up with action.</Hansard-Body>

We have seen delays on the Eastern Busway, the South East Busway and the rail line to Elanora, and CAMCOS is a project that this government has pushed out now to beyond 2031, according to this document. The government is failing to deliver on public transport infrastructure but it is putting the costs up. It says one thing and does another. Queenslanders can expect a congestion charge and more taxes under this government. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (11.41 am): Each year the Queensland government provides funding through the Multicultural Assistance Program for community groups to host events and run projects that strengthen multiculturalism, foster harmonious community relations and participation and build community capacity, including improved access to services in Queensland. In 2009-10, funding of $700,000 was allocated for this purpose. This was the most competitive round in history, with over 200 applications received--our highest number of applications in 10 years. The total amount of funding requested far exceeded what was available. Considering the amount of cross-cultural benefit that this funding produces within the community, it is certainly money well spent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018221"></A>
The minister has approved funding for 98 events and projects in 2010 which is also the highest number of applications funded in the last 10 years. The assessment process was rigorous, and this has helped to ensure a wide spread of high-quality events to be implemented right across the state. I am very excited by the diversity of events and projects that are being funded this year, and I look forward to attending many of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018222"></A>
We have just witnessed the vibrant celebrations for the Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year. In March, Queenslanders will have the opportunity to join in the Fraser Coast Cultural Festival, the Multicultural Carina Festival and the Central Queensland Multicultural Festival and to celebrate Telugu New Year, Nowrooz--the Persian New Year--and Harmony Day events. Many community projects have also been funded to increase the capacity of Queenslanders from culturally diverse backgrounds to access services they need. I encourage members of parliament to actively participate in these events which are such an important way of recognising and celebrating our cultural diversity. </Hansard-Body>

As the Parliamentary Secretary for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs, I would like to commend the hard work of a small team of people in MAQ responsible for administering the grants program.

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (11.43 am): The Productivity Commission’s <Hansard-Italic>
Report on government services 2010</Hansard-Italic>
, recently released, showed some concerning statistics in relation to people suffering from a mental illness and how their needs are being met in Queensland. The report highlighted that Queensland continued to have the lowest level of recurrent spending on mental health and services of any Australian state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Mental health funding at the discretion of the Queensland state government was $143 per person in 2007-08 compared to an average of $164 in the other states. Alarmingly, the number of available hospital beds per 100,000 residents for those with a mental illness has fallen in Queensland for the fifth consecutive year, from 36.8 in 2003-04 to 33.3 in 2007-08, whilst the national average is 41.2. One in every six patients discharged from a psychiatric hospital bed is readmitted within 28 days--a rate higher than any other state--and only 44 per cent of mental health patients in 2007-08 received a community follow-up within seven days of discharge, compared to over 50 per cent a year earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018238"></A>
Of most concern is the total lack of dedicated hospital beds for those with a mental illness. I fear that the lack of beds may be leading to patients being discharged earlier than appropriate, because the report reveals that almost one in every six patients discharged from a hospital is readmitted within 28 days--a rate higher than any other state. The report did highlight that funding in Queensland for community mental health services has increased, yet only 44 per cent of mental health patients in 2007-08 received a community follow-up within seven days of discharge, compared to over 50 per cent a year earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018239"></A>
Clearly the mental health system and the way we treat people who suffer from mental illness is in significant difficulty. It will take a system that deals with prevention, early intervention and treatment, tackling issues including substance abuse, domestic violence and social isolation to build a structure that will provide adequate care, protection and recovery models for the future. </Hansard-Body>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (11.45 am): Last Saturday the local business community embraced the need for a clean environment when the Redcliffe City Chamber of Commerce hosted me and the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, Stirling Hinchliffe, to launch the Business Clean Up Australia in Redcliffe. The event was held at Redefined Cafe, and owner Rod Kemp welcomed us and we joined his normal Saturday lunch patrons and passers-by. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018252"></A>
President of the chamber, Irena Morgan from MW, addressed the crowd with the support of chamber secretary Deb Grealey from Beads by the Beach. It was heartening to see that the business community, who are seen as role models in the community, are keen to lead the charge in cleaning up the Redcliffe CBD and shopping precinct. This show of business support will encourage other people who may not normally take the time out to clean up their corner of our precious natural environment to give a couple of hours on Clean Up Australia Day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018257"></A>
This clean-up will not only make the Redcliffe CBD a cleaner and more pleasant environment in which to shop and eat but also ensure that less rubbish will go into our stormwater system and that fewer cigarette butts and less plastic will find their way into the stomachs of sea birds and turtles. This demonstrates the symbiotic nature of acting to increase environmental outcomes and running a successful business, particularly in Redcliffe--where we are surrounded by Moreton Bay and Hays Inlet--because we are working to develop our fledgling tourism industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018263"></A>
The launch of Business Clean Up Australia in the Redcliffe CBD demonstrated the Bligh government’s strong focus on achieving our targets of protecting our environment and growing a strong economy. Reaching our targets is what good government is all about, and this Labor government is about good government. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (11.47 am): On 1 September last year I asked the Minister for Education and Training to detail the number of weapon incidents that occurred in Queensland schools. The answer to question on notice No. 1054 in essence says, ‘This isn’t the department’s problem. It’s a problem for individual schools and the police,’ and no details were provided. Similarly, in answer to question on notice No. 1334, no details of the number of lockdowns were provided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018269"></A>
Last year the LNP opposition was trying to urge the government to take the growing concern around weapons seriously, only to find that the government was so disinterested that it could not or would not even tell parliament the extent of the problem. How can you define the extent of a problem or assess whether measures to contain it are effective if you cannot even provide an answer to a question in parliament about the number of serious incidents? Deputy Premier Lucas said this morning that ‘accountability breeds excellence’. That has been missed by the education minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018271"></A>
When suddenly, through tragic circumstances, media attention is focused on the issue, the government in fact is able to provide the figures to the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
--the figures that it would not provide to parliament. Apart from the obvious disregard for parliamentary accountability, this tragically demonstrates again that on matters of grave importance to Queensland parents the government only acts when it comes to dealing with media fallout. The LNP believes that the government should be proactive in dealing with these worsening trends before they end in tragedy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018273"></A>
Yesterday I placed on notice a question in relation to another serious problem in our schools--the number of drug incidents. Drug incidents are linked to violence in our schools. The problem is serious in our schools. Is the government waiting for this problem to hit the papers, too, before it does anything? Any reasonable person would expect that the government would be closely tracking this problem and will be prepared to answer a reasonable question from the opposition. We shall see in 29 days. </Hansard-Body>

Waterford Electorate, Job Creation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (11.49 am): Twelve months ago, I was part of the Bligh Labor team that went to the Queensland electorate promising jobs, not job cuts, and an $18 billion infrastructure program that would protect 127,000 Queensland jobs. In Logan, the state government’s commitment to job creation can be seen in major projects like the Pacific Motorway upgrade at the Loganlea Road interchange, a project creating 1,400 jobs and improving traffic flow for 140,000 motorists.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018313"></A>
But there are also local projects that are giving young people from Logan and Beenleigh an opportunity to get ready for work and get a job. The state government’s Skilling Queenslanders for Work program has given thousands of Queenslanders a chance to enter the workforce. In our area, organisations such as BoysTown and the Beenleigh PCYC have delivered practical local projects that provide real employment outcomes. One of these projects is the fantastic partnership between BoysTown and the Waterford Demons Rugby League Football Club. The Waterford Rugby League Football Club project provided a construction work placement program for eight young local people looking to get a start in construction and landscaping.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018314"></A>
As well as making sure these eight young Logan people are job ready, the project delivered important upgrades for the Demons’ home ground at Noffke Park. During the 16-week project, the eight participants installed approximately 130 metres of fencing posts and rails between the two main fields, constructed concrete pads and erected two player dugouts, constructed concrete pathway and disability access and approximately 130 metres of footpath to the clubhouse, constructed approximately 60 metres of retaining walls, constructed a wood bin enclosure and painted a new mural on the club’s facilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018315"></A>
The project was delivered with the support of the Logan City Council, which contributed the material costs for the project, and the owners of the sporting fields. At the project graduation on 22 January, the success of these job programs could be seen when half of the participants were too busy working to attend the graduation. The Bligh government’s commitment to jobs, not job cuts, continues to give young people in Logan the opportunity to have a job, a career and the dignity of work. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (11.51 am): I rise to speak on behalf of the public transport users in my electorate of Buderim. They would like to be able to take advantage of the government’s wonderful go card system and make their travel cheaper and easier. Unfortunately, unless they are able to purchase and top up their go cards online, they are out of luck. In its wisdom, the government has failed to provide a single retail outlet for go cards in the entire Buderim electorate--not one. The minister and her bureaucrats may not have been to Buderim recently. If they looked at our electorate, they would discover that there are plenty of potential retail outlets that could handle the go cards. They would also discover that there is a significant population of older residents, many of whom do not use computers but do use buses. In fact, these residents would like more buses so they can get out and about, particularly if they no longer drive a vehicle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018319"></A>
To give you an example, I have an elderly constituent who was thrilled last year when TransLink extended the local bus route so she can now use it. In the past, it was too far for her to walk to a bus stop. She has been a regular bus user ever since and it has made a big difference to her life, but she cannot buy a go card to use this bus--not without catching a bus to the customer service centre in Maroochydore. They offer a limited service there. You can buy a $20 go card, provided you have cash and do not want to use EFTPOS or credit. Yes, people without computers can buy go cards over the phone or send in a form, but older people in particular often do not like to buy over the phone. They like to do it in person, and that is their right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018320"></A>
When it comes to services like public transport, we should ensure that everyone has equal access. We should not be discriminating in favour of those who are used to technology and feel comfortable using it. Older people, like my constituent, want to stay independent and in their own homes. To do that, we need to make sure they have access to good public transport options. The bureaucrats who designed the go card system should come down from their city offices and look at how the system really works for the people who use it. Go cards should be widely available through retail outlets that are convenient to the people who want to buy them. It is time the minister and her department took action to make it happen. </Hansard-Body>

Koala Protection</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018323"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (11.53 am): I rise to give my support to recent positive news that this state Labor government will introduce new conservation measures to protect koalas in priority koala bushland habitats. Koala populations in South-East Queensland, and particularly in the Morayfield state electorate, have been declining for a number of years and these progressive announcements will mean that this vulnerable species will be further protected. The new package of measures will protect priority koala habitat, rehabilitate habitat impacted by development and create new habitat for future koala populations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018324"></A>
The conservation measures include: a ban on all habitat-clearing development in priority areas until new planning instruments are finalised; an initial amount of $15 million for buying new habitat and rehabilitating existing habitat; compulsory acquisition powers for koala habitat outside the urban footprint; new planning laws for councils to minimise koala impacts when assessing development applications in key koala areas; new controls for councils to ban dogs in new developments in koala habitat; and new planning laws to allow land swaps in and outside the urban footprint for strategic koala habitat corridors. I also note that this state government is making $400,000 in state funding available to researchers to study chlamydia and other serious koala diseases. It is hoped that this funded research will help find ways to reduce the impact of disease on koala populations in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018325"></A>
I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the hard work of the Moreton Bay Koala Rescue group. I commend the group’s volunteers for their selfless and dedicated service to the protection and care of koalas in the Morayfield state electorate. When it comes to the protection of koala populations, governments can do something or nothing. In this instance, this state Labor government is doing something. In this instance, this state Labor government is working hard to provide the greatest protection of koalas ever seen in South-East Queensland. It is this Labor government which is leading policy development on environmental protection in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018339"></A>
Today I introduce a bill into parliament that seeks to provide further protection to our state’s police and a bill that will hold violent thugs who seriously assault police accountable for their actions. When it comes to violent assaults against our state’s police and emergency services workers, the time for making excuses for criminals must stop and the laws need to be strengthened to ensure that real deterrence is implemented.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018340"></A>
The bill I present seeks to establish a minimum sentence range for offenders found guilty of seriously assaulting police, ambulance and fire officers where the assault involves biting, spitting or throwing bodily fluid or faeces at an officer in the course of their duties. In the case of assaults against police, this type of serious assault is much more than just resisting arrest. The types of serious assault I have outlined involve some form of decision to act out the assault and can have serious physical and emotional effects on the victim. The agony and anguish that a police officer or emergency services worker must go through waiting months for results of testing to find out if they have been exposed to a communicable disease is a harrowing experience. This ongoing suffering is not just isolated to the officer but also involves his or her family.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018341"></A>
In 2007 there were 429 offenders convicted of serious assaults against police officers. This bill seeks to introduce a minimum sentencing range for serious assaults on police where the assault involves biting, spitting or throwing bodily fluid or faeces. In view of the time, I seek leave for the remainder of my speech to be incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018342"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018343"></A>
Between December 2008 and June 2009 police officers made 155 WorkCover claims for assaults against them and in almost half those cases (72) the officer was exposed to blood or bodily fluid.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018344"></A>
The Bill makes it clear that the minimum sentence that a court may impose on an offender who is guilty of a serious assault under a new part 2B, that defines certain types of serious assaults, is 3 months imprisonment. Offenders convicted for a serious assault on a police officer or emergency services worker, where the assault involves actual biting, spitting on, throwing bodily fluid or faeces at an officer fall within the new sentencing provisions contained in 2C. The new part 340(2D) makes it clear that the minimum 3 month term may not be suspended.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018345"></A>
Assaults against our emergency services workers are as equally deplorable and this is why the LNP has sought to include them in this legislation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018346"></A>
Figures indicate in the financial year 2007-2008, 38 assault incidents were reported by QAS officers, 1 of which was reported to the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and 1 incident resulted in a paramedic being unable to commence their next shift.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018347"></A>
In the financial year 2008-2009, 107 assault incidents were reported by QAS officers, 11 of which were reported to QPS and 7 resulted in a paramedic being unable to commence their next shift.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018348"></A>
In the financial year 2009-2010 (YTD as of 19.8.09) 21 assault incidents were reported by QAS officers, 5 of which were reported to the QPS and none have resulted in a paramedic being unable to commence their next shift.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018349"></A>
Any assault against a police officer or emergency services officers is one too many and we on this side of the House are determined to ensure that the penalty reflects the seriousness of the crime when it comes to these vicious attacks. If we do not respect and move to protect those at the front line who are there just to protect us, what hope is there?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018350"></A>
The Bill allows a court to take into account exceptional circumstances where the offender is a child as to whether the minimum 3 months imprisonment is to be imposed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(Brisbane Central--ALP) (11.58 am): Well, if you were Chuck Feeney of Atlantic Philanthropies and you wanted to invest in world-class scientific and medical research, where would you go? Brisbane, Queensland, is the answer. It was wonderful to be with Premier Anna Bligh as the first sod was turned on a new addition to Queensland’s medical research and development capabilities. This is particularly exciting as work has begun during February, which is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, and I am today joining the Teal Team by wearing this teal ribbon.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018357"></A>
The $179 million Queensland Institute of Medical Research Centre at Herston in Brisbane will create about 360 jobs during construction, will be home to 20 new research laboratories and will be staffed by 400 scientists and students. This facility will be completed by 2012 and has been funded by the state and federal governments and by Atlantic Philanthropies. The centre will increase the capability of QIMR to further its research in areas such as tropical diseases, vaccine development, cancer and genetics, which is excellent news for women suffering ovarian cancer during this special month.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018358"></A>
Equally exciting will be the introduction of a Mental Health Research Division, with brain neuroimaging facilities which will enable QIMR to improve research of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Added to this will be an expansion in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, with room for 20 extra scientists researching cancer, asthma, rheumatic heart disease, dementia and maternal and child health. An education centre, which is part of the project, features a state-of-the-art high school research laboratory for teacher and student workshops.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018359"></A>
The state government over the last decade has transformed Queensland’s scientific community from 8,500 scientists to 18,100 scientists during this period--the biggest increase of any Australian state. New scientific infrastructure like this will continue to make Queensland a world-class player in the vital areas of scientific and medical research, and I ask: what can be better than that? Lives will be saved and cures will be found because of QIMR’s world-class research. I am proud to have them in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (12.00 pm): I would like to take this opportunity to raise a matter that for some reason the Minister for Health is either unable or unwilling to answer. Based on the performance of the Minister for Health, I suspect it is the latter. With respect to the delayed Sunshine Coast University Hospital, on 20 August 2009 I asked the minister by question on notice--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018417"></A>
With reference to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital ... planning (project) board--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018418"></A>
Have any members of the board been sacked, made redundant, transferred or ‘re-orientated’ since the announcement that the SCUH would be delayed by up to two years and, if so, who and why? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018419"></A>
The minister wrote back as follows--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018424"></A>
With reference to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital project/planning board and the Minister’s previous answer to my Question on Notice ... who is currently on the board ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I refer the Member to my answer to Question on Notice ... in which I provided a response to these issues. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018428"></A>
No, he did not. So on 24 November 2009 I asked the minister again--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018430"></A>
When is the Sunshine Coast University Hospital project team being re-convened? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018431"></A>
The minister answered--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018433"></A>
As I have advised the member in more than one answer to his Questions on Notice in recent weeks, the project team continues its work to deliver the $1.57 billion Sunshine Coast University Hospital. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018434"></A>
The question remains unanswered. Having given up on the minister’s ability to answer quite a simple question, I headed to the government website--Sunshine Coast University Hospital ‘Getting Involved’. Apparently as well as the project team there is a stakeholder advisory group involving members of the community. There are no other details and--a recurring theme for this--no names of the stakeholder group. What is interesting is the ‘Getting Involved’ information for members of the public, if they do want to get involved: ‘Further information about how you can get involved will be available soon.’ This is from the government website about the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. It was last updated on 31 March 2008. Two years ago the minister and his own department’s website says that, if the Sunshine Coast community wants to get involved, wait two years. It is not acceptable. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (12.02 pm): It is Australian Organ Donor Awareness week. Many times my heart has been warmed by stories of the wonderful difference organ and tissue donation has made to the life of the grateful recipients and their families: freedom from dialysis, sight returned, a strong heart, the chance to breathe freely again. Unfortunately, the more sombre question of being a donor is less often discussed or the subject of media coverage. Of course, a loved one’s illness, accident or death is a fearful, heart-rending time. It is a time of clinging to hope and supporting loved ones and making decisions about treatment. We are stressed, emotional and grief stricken. It is not the time to be discussing organ or tissue donation. But for many of us it is the only time we are asked to discuss it, and we are required to make rapid decisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018443"></A>
It is a great pity when there is only a one per cent chance that a person will be able to be a donor for that chance to pass by because families do not know the wishes of the deceased, because people have not told their family of their wishes or they are not on the donor register. I have long been a fan of opt-out legislation, or presumed consent, as a means of increasing the number of people on the donor register. Some research states that presumed consent can improve the chance of a donor being available by as much as 25 per cent. Other research says that it is the availability of facilities and community education that makes the biggest difference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018444"></A>
I am aware that it may be a difficult social decision, but perhaps presumed consent could ensure that more conversations take place and lead to a much needed increase in available donors. I urge all Queenslanders to join the other 912,000 of us and sign on to the donor register; promote organ and tissue donation and the selflessness of such a decision to friends and workmates; talk to your families; and make sure they know your wishes. In the face of terrible loss, the knowledge that other critically ill Queenslanders and their families will be given a new lease of life may give much needed comfort. </Hansard-Body>

Last year I introduced a private member’s bill to amend Queensland planning laws by creating a new simple law to regulate community hospices in Queensland. Since then I have had discussions with Minister Hinchliffe and our Premier. As a result, the government has now created a new simple law to regulate community hospices in Queensland. I thank the Premier and Minister Hinchliffe for listening to my request to change the law and for changing the law in Queensland. I will now not need to proceed with debate on my private member’s bill. I table for the benefit of all members a copy of the government’s new planning provision, ‘Regulating community hospices in Queensland’. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (12.06 pm), by leave: A new state government planning code has paved the way for a much needed palliative care development on the Sunshine Coast. Following the introduction of the code, the Sunshine Coast Regional Council unanimously agreed to endorse a local planning instrument to reduce red tape for a proposed community residence development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018466"></A>
 Katie Rose Cottage, in the hinterland community of Doonan, west of Noosa, is now, I understand, ready to open and help terminally ill Sunshine Coast people to die with dignity. The small facility is the realisation of a dream for palliative care nurses Terry Clarke-Burrows and Sue Story, who spent the last two years working to make the cottage a reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018469"></A>
This valuable service equally would not have been possible without the member for Nicklin. It was the member for Nicklin who first brought Katie Rose Cottage to the state government’s attention with a private member’s bill to amend the Integrated Planning Act on 28 October. The member for Nicklin pushed for change at state and local level, and it is largely due to his efforts that Katie Rose Cottage can now open its doors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018470"></A>
The Bligh government recognises that there is a need for more similar facilities. On 18 December the state government finalised changes to the planning laws to allow councils to amend planning schemes and permit residential homes to become palliative care hospices, with up to six guest rooms in each house. I would like to congratulate the Sunshine Coast Regional Council for being the first local government in Queensland to implement this policy, and provide additional dignity and comfort to terminally ill community members when they need it most. I hope their decision encourages other councils to provide similar much needed care facilities for terminally ill patients and their families within their local planning schemes. I would again like to commend Mrs Clarke-Burrows, Mrs Story and the member for Nicklin for their dedication and hard work. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (12.08 pm): I am pleased to make a contribution to the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. There are three main areas covered under this bill. I will address these three areas in order. The first area of this bill is that, following on from early legislation that published certain notices that were issued to child-care operators on a website, we are now in this bill requiring child-care operators to keep a logbook available to parents and prospective parents that details any notices, variations to their licence, suspensions et cetera. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018478"></A>
The main difference that this bill has to the existing arrangements is that minor notices or notices pertaining to minor breaches will also be included in the logbook. The LNP and I, as shadow minister, have consistently supported parents’ right to information. Even where this has been a difficult issue, such as the My School website, we have taken the attitude that the overriding right of parents to have access to information about where their children are cared for or where they are educated should be the guiding principle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018518"></A>
In the case of the My School website, that was a difficult decision for us because that information is prone to misuse. We see with the creation of league tables that conclusions are erroneously drawn that because a school’s overall performance on a league table exceeds another school’s then the school higher in the league table is providing a better outcome for individual students. That is a false conclusion that cannot be drawn. The LNP has had that concern about league tables, but we have supported the publication of this data on the basis that the overriding consideration that the LNP wishes to support is that parents have a right to this information. For the same reason, we will not be opposing the provision in this bill relating to logbooks being maintained in the child-care sector. I do wish to express some concerns and make some points that the minister and the department may wish to take on board. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018520"></A>
I put the bill that the minister introduced in the last sitting week out to consultation among industry stakeholders and operators in the industry. I think it is very instructive to look at some of the feedback I received. It would be in the best interests all round if the government took on board some of the feedback that we have been getting for a while. I certainly will not name the industry participants who have made these comments, but it is pretty important to record their comments in relation to this bill. In relation to the keeping of logbooks, one respondent says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018521"></A>
Every time we have an inspection the inspectors feel obliged to give a notice to justify their existence--not saying that these visits should not happen but that the consistency and veracity of what they do leaves a lot to be desired. For example, we could get a notice because the text on a staff member’s photograph was 16 point and not 18 point in size. We have had this happen at our centre, and many other centres report similar things. Now, if this gets published it is rubbish. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018522"></A>
The same respondent further states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018523"></A>
I don’t know if the legislators know this, but a disproportionate amount of our teachers’ time is keeping logs. For example, in the last accreditation rounds we had to introduce a log where each teacher documented all the interventions given to each child that day so that when the parents arrived to pick up their children they could read what had happened. A great idea, but it is a trade-off against actual care. This logbook is of the same kind. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018524"></A>
He then goes on to perhaps suggest a bit of annoyance in the industry by saying, ‘If the government wants this, then they should publish their own documents.’ Another respondent says in relation to the logbooks--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018525"></A>
Child-Care logbook--more paper for nothing much. This is a factor for centres to share when nobody in their right mind is going to show a parent a logbook that is negative. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018526"></A>
From the opposition’s point of view, we do not think that justifies not having the information available, of course. The respondent continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018527"></A>
Government knows that closing a seriously non-complaint centre will lose them votes so instead of getting tough they are loading us, the operators, up with more useless paperwork. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018528"></A>
There is a theme of concern there that we are not adequately differentiating between the serious breaches--the things that may endanger a child--and things that might be considered administrative breaches or minor breaches. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018529"></A>
Another very senior industry participant was concerned that this sort of focus, particularly when it is on minor issues such as the point size of the writing on a staff member’s photograph, may lead to us becoming so totally risk averse that we affect normal childhood experiences. This is a theme that I have had repeated to me by a number of industry participants. This major stakeholder in the industry, whom I will not name because I have not sought their permission to use their name, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018530"></A>
Even though I am sure some services will continue to receive non-compliance notices, I am more concerned with what may constitute noncompliance, particularly in outdoor environments, as history tells us there are quite varying degrees as to what is appropriate, safe or challenging in the outdoors. I would hate to see the trend to sanitise early childhood advanced any more through an overzealous compliance regime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018532"></A>
Those saying this are all major industry participants in child-care and kindergarten services. They are certainly well known to the opposition and reputable operators. Those concerns about red tape and about getting the balance right between protecting children, a parent’s right to know and tying up a lot of time for incredibly minor things that will lead to industry simply becoming very risk averse and very focused on pretty trivial things may have some counterproductive effects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018533"></A>
The opposition will be applying its overriding belief that parents have a right to this information. We will not be opposing the provision to maintain logbooks in child-care centres, but we do want the government to understand the concern that is out there in the industry and the fact that sometimes there is a difference between what we enact here in legislation and how it is applied--that is, whether it is appropriate and whether common sense is used. I appreciate the minister’s nod on that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018536"></A>
The second of the three areas that this bill applies to is the Masters report recommendation that teachers graduating from university and seeking registration as a teacher should sit a test of their proficiency in literacy, numeracy and science--the ‘test the teacher’ provision. The opposition has given the government bipartisan support on this issue, as we will continue to do by supporting the measure in the bill today. It is a difficult issue to discuss in some contexts. There has been concern expressed, including within the teaching profession, within universities and within other forums, that the standard of teachers coming out of our universities may not, in some instances, be good enough. I hope that is taken in context. That concern is there. Masters identified and expressed that concern. He recommended that this measure go forward. We will be supporting the government in doing so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018537"></A>
There are a couple of things that the minister may care to clarify for us. The explanatory notes to this bill indicate quite clearly that there will be no cost to government as a result of the measures in this bill. That leads me to conclude that the Queensland College of Teachers, which will be required to purchase these tests or write them themselves and presumably apply them, mark them and collate results, will not receive additional government funding to do this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018540"></A>
The Queensland College of Teachers is largely funded by the fees that teachers pay. Teachers might feel particularly aggrieved that existing teacher registration fees have to fund this test. The only other way I can see this being funded--and the minister, I trust, will clarify this for me in his summing-up--is through some sort of user-pays system. That is, those sitting the test through the Queensland College of Teachers will be required to pay the cost of sitting the test. I think that is potentially a very harsh outcome, but at the end of the day someone is going to have to pay the costs for these tests and this bill indicates that the government is not going to be that somebody. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018569"></A>
We have seen recently that an overwhelming majority of teacher graduates in Queensland have been unable to obtain a full-time teaching job--the overwhelming majority. Many of these kids graduating from university--many of them will be very good teachers given the opportunity--have a right to ask some questions about what has gone on in relation to planning in that we are producing teachers, we appear to desperately need teachers but when they graduate there is in fact no job for them. I fear that some of these graduates will become very disenchanted and feel that they are not wanted. I certainly would not like to see the Queensland College of Teachers, because it receives no government funding, then pass another major obstacle on to new graduates in making them pay the cost of these tests. It would be particularly galling if they have to pay the cost of the test in order to be registered but when they get registered there is no job for them anyway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018574"></A>
The third part of the bill relates to workers in non-school areas. Some of these changes in my view are necessary changes. There are probably three areas where we are making changes in this bill. One issue revolves around the requirement of teachers to re-register every five years and in order to keep their recency of practice they must have worked the equivalent of one year in five; otherwise they need to go through a process to re-establish their recency which can be in service but requires them to upgrade their knowledge of the syllabus and so forth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018577"></A>
Under the existing act, to be considered to be working as a teacher one needs to be working in a school. But, as we know, teachers do sometimes work in places that are not technically considered to be a school. The obvious one that is going to grow greatly in importance is in the area of early childhood where we will have four-year trained university teachers working in child-care centres, which are now moving to deliver the kindergarten programs, or in the government’s new C&amp;K operated centres. These teachers would not at the moment be technically considered to be working in a school. Therefore, that teaching work would not qualify them for recency of teaching work when they come to re-register. The opposition would certainly support the measures in this bill that would allow those teachers to have that work recognised as teaching for recency purposes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018580"></A>
Another example is the TAFE senior colleges. Provided the teacher is delivering a Queensland curriculum for schools as part of that TAFE senior college, that will also be recognised as teaching experience. There are a number of TAFE senior colleges around the state, notably in the electorate of my colleague the member for Hervey Bay and also in Alexandra Hills. Again, provided those teachers are delivering an approved school curriculum, I do not think anyone would have any desire to dispute the fact that they are currently teaching.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018581"></A>
It becomes a little bit greyer when we move into the area of education advisers or what is referred to in the explanatory notes as people who are on leadership duties, and I think it is quite a bit greyer. I understand that there are something like 20 education advisers per education district, so we are possibly looking at around 200 people. It also applies of course to literacy and numeracy coaches. It would be fair to say that the opposition would prefer that people in these educational advice roles were in fact still meeting the requirement for recency--that is, that they did the equivalent of one year in five in the classroom. In any sort of profession, particularly a rapidly moving profession like teaching, there is not really a substitute for spending at least some time--perhaps only the equivalent of one day a week--in the classroom at the coalface. That would certainly be our preference.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018584"></A>
I do hope that the minister might give some more detail in relation to this matter. I do note that there is an assurance in the explanatory notes--and a very important assurance as far as the opposition is concerned--that this measure will not extend to bureaucrats or white-collar workers within the department whose role is not directly related to activity in the classroom. I would rely on that assurance, but we would like some more detail. The opposition would not wish to penalise any particular group that is genuinely working in teaching related activities or classroom related activities and we would not want to necessarily single out a group to oppose the fact that their work should be treated as currency. It is not our intention to oppose any of these provisions that I have just discussed, but more information will go some way to assuaging some concerns.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018588"></A>
I would also ask the minister in his summing-up to give us more information as to how many extra teacher registrations his department considers will result from the extension of the currency arrangements in this bill. The three areas that I have spoken about today are the key areas of the bill, so I do not intend to go on any longer in relation to it. I look forward to the minister making some additional comments and I will ensure that I have a few questions for him during consideration in detail of the bill. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (12.26 pm): I rise to contribute to the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. The objectives of this bill are to amend the Child Care Act 2002 to require licensees of child-care services, other than school-age care services, to keep logbooks of their compliance and to amend the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005 to test persons on literacy, numeracy and science prior to their registration as teachers and to recognise certain teaching experience for the purposes of teacher registration. I have a particular interest in the child-care portion of this bill given that in the electorate of Mudgeeraba there are 27 child-care centres in areas such as Mudgeeraba, Tallai, Gilston, Merrimac, Worongary and Robina. I have visited each of these centres so that I can represent their views in parliament and I have previously shared their concerns in this House over proposed changes to legislation relating to the ratio of children to teachers and the process of standardisation to bring Queensland into line with other states.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018604"></A>
In addition to private child-care providers, there is a C&amp;K community kindergarten in my electorate which has been neglected by the government in terms of funding for many years. During the election this C&amp;K kindergarten was reannounced again, with funding to include a new kindergarten attached to Mudgeeraba State School. This announcement was greeted cynically by the private operators who saw this as nothing more than political pork-barrelling, as it had been reannounced three times earlier. This has now commenced construction. Of particular interest and prior concern to the private operators was the name and shame requirements to be added to a website for even minor infringements. It was reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 6 October 2009 when child-care centres were being named and shamed under the legislation that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018610"></A>
‘Childcare Queensland president Gwynn Bridge said operators did not support the laws but would work with the Government to ensure they were applied fairly. Everyone is concerned about these laws,’ Mrs Bridge said.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018611"></A>
‘We need to ensure natural justice is followed and businesses which are to be named are given the chance to correct their problems.’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018615"></A>
This bill will now require child-care services to keep a logbook under the Child Care Act 2002. This will include centres such as long day care, kindergartens and limited hours care, and home based services such as family day care.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021700"></A>
It also regulates stand-alone services where child care is provided to no more than six children, four of whom are not yet schoolchildren. The CCA includes a rigorous monitoring and enforcement regime to ensure that child-care services comply with the terms of their licences and with the guiding principles of the CCA. Where a service fails to meet these requirements, a range of measures may be taken against it. These measures range from issuing compliance notices requesting the service to remedy any contravention of the act to taking action to amend, urgently amend, suspend, urgently suspend, refuse to renew or revoke the service provider’s licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021701"></A>
The first stage of these amendments, which commenced on 1 February 2010, enables the Department of Education and Training to publish on its website information about child-care services--other than school-age care services--that demonstrate that serious and repeated noncompliance is more than minor in nature. Childcare Queensland and associated child-care centres are working closely with the government to ensure that members are compliant under the previous changes in legislation to name and shame and will work in collaboration to ensure that centres are compliant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021705"></A>
A recent press release from the President of Childcare Queensland, Gwynn Bridge, states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021707"></A>
... that compliance letters are issued by a state compliance officer during a visit and are often fixable the same day. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021708"></A>
‘Compliance letters are issued to private and community child care providers during prearranged and unannounced spot checks,’ Ms Bridge said.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021709"></A>
‘In 2009, 97.6 per cent of compliance letters were addressed in the time allocated,’ she said which leaves 2.4% of compliance letters becoming the more serious ‘Compliance Notice’. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021710"></A>
‘We do not condone child care providers that delay addressing compliance issues, however each compliance letter and issue must be placed into context and taken on a case by case basis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021711"></A>
‘We are working with the Government to ensure that a quality system is maintained that fairly identifies and deals with the small number of service providers in Queensland who are having difficulty meeting regulations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021712"></A>
As a result of collaboration on the legislation, the majority of service providers already comply with the legislation. However, there are limited exceptions where some service providers contravene the CCA or expose children in their care to serious risks to child safety and wellbeing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021713"></A>
The second stage of these amendments, which is the subject of this bill, will require all licensed child-care services--except school-age care services--to record in a logbook information about any notices given to them under the CCA relating to minor, moderate or serious noncompliance. The logbook will be accessible to current and prospective parents of children attending the service. The requirement for licensees to keep a logbook for their services will apply to all licensed centre based child-care services--for example, long day care, kindergarten and limited hours care--except for school-age care services. These are excluded from the scheme. The provision will also apply to all licensed home based services, such as family day care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021714"></A>
 These amendments are aimed at providing parents at the local level with access to information about the quality of the child-care service and to enable them to make informed decisions about a child-care service that is providing or will potentially provide a service to their child. However, the LNP believes that these amendments to the Child Care Act are another layer of bureaucracy for the centres to fulfil. Although the safety of children is always paramount, the government’s view appears to be that increasing the paperwork alone will accord with an increase in safety in child-care centres. The introduction of compliance logbooks imposes a large amount of compliance on the child-care providers, where each clause is accompanied by a $1,000 fine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021716"></A>
Centres in my area are already struggling with the changes that were made through compliance legislation that was introduced in 2009. These changes include the impending implementation of national guidelines, the impact of the prep year and the threat of a pre-prep year. Many local operators in the Mudgeeraba electorate have expressed their concern about bearing the increased cost of these changes whilst also facing decreased revenues through the changed guidelines in the size of rooms in Queensland and the number of children they can now accommodate. That in turn leads to an increase in child-care fees for parents. </Hansard-Body>

The Mudgeeraba electorate is a fast-growing electorate, with over 65 per cent of the electorate under 45 years of age with school-age children. Many more children are at the preschool level and under, and this number is growing rapidly. This young community needs the services that it deserves. The Mudgeeraba electorate has 27 child-care centres and eight feeder state primary schools. Unfortunately for this young and vibrant electorate, it is yet to have a state high school west of the M1. Parents of children at child-care centres in my electorate have all raised this issue with me and have signed petitions for a feasibility study for a new state high school. Currently, over 35 per cent of the children in my electorate cross the M1 to access education services. It is high time this government took its head out of the sand and provided the Mudgeeraba electorate with that much needed infrastructure now and not in 20 years time. </Hansard-Body>

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank many child-care operators in my electorate who have actively assisted in providing me with information so that I can better enunciate their concerns about legislation being rushed through. In particular, I would like to thank Kerrie Lada from Hardy’s Road Early Childhood Centre, who is also the secretary of Childcare Queensland, and Mary-Anne Hossack from the Montessori child-care centre in Mudgeeraba for their continued input into this debate. I will continue to work closely with all of the child-care operators in my electorate so that I am their voice in parliament. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (12.34 pm): Unlike the previous speaker, I rise to speak in full support of the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill. Arguably, the greatest achievement of the Beattie and Bligh governments over the past 12 years has been in the area of education. I think people throughout Queensland are well aware of the fantastic reforms that this government has undertaken in the area of education. Those reforms include implementing the prep year--something that was absent from Queensland’s education system for decades. Much research has indicated that that absence is one of the causes of some of our relatively poor literacy and numeracy results in recent years. This government also introduced the ‘learning or earning’ reforms into secondary schooling, which required all young people up to the age of 17 to be engaged in school, training or work. We have also introduced a greater focus on literacy and numeracy, and that has been a particularly recent effort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021725"></A>
Some members are aware of kindergartens that are in the process of being constructed in their own electorates. I am fortunate enough to have a new kindergarten being constructed at the Prince of Peace Lutheran College at Everton Hills in the electorate that I represent. I know that the community of the Prince of Peace Lutheran College is very excited about that, as am I. Two hundred and forty new kindergartens will be rolled out in the next few years to give our young children the flying start that they need in education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021727"></A>
Recently the government released a green paper proposing some additional education reforms. I have heard the Premier say that, as much as we have achieved in this area of education and training, we can never stand still. This green paper proposes some further dramatic reforms to Queensland’s education system, particularly a proposal to move year 7 to secondary school. Other reforms implemented by this government have included integrating our curriculum, assessment and reporting regimes and--something that is relevant to this bill--the provision of greater information to parents and the general community on school and student performance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021728"></A>
I think this bill represents another plank in this government’s education reform agenda. The first element of the bill that I would like to address is the requirement for licensees of child-care services to keep logbooks of their compliance history. As many people would be aware, the child-care legislation that we have in Queensland allows child-care services to be breached for a failure to comply with their licence and the legislation. As I think the member who spoke before me implied, these breaches are not necessarily trifling matters. The kinds of things that child-care services can be breached for include a failure to provide children with a safe environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021729"></A>
As the father of a young child who attends a day-care service, I would want to make sure that his child-care service provides him with a safe environment each and every day that he attends but, more importantly, I would also like to be aware of the compliance history of the child-care service that my child attends. Until now, parents have been unable to find out the compliance history of the child-care centre that their child attends or a centre that they may be intending to send their child to. As I mentioned, I would want to know this kind of information and I think most parents would be in the same boat. Of course, wanting to make sure that your child is going to be in a safe place each day is an absolutely critical component of your decision making when deciding what kind of child-care service--or indeed school--that your child will attend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021730"></A>
I think this reform, which will require licensees to have a logbook and publish instances where they have failed to comply with their licence or the legislation, is a very good step forward in giving parents the kind of information they need to make good decisions about which child-care centre to send their child to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021731"></A>
We need to be very careful about the use of published data on schools and child-care services. In recent years there has been great debate in the community about this issue. I was very proud to be involved, as the then adviser to the then education minister, who is now the Premier, when our government brought in greater reporting of school performance in Queensland. We were the first government in Queensland to publish a range of data on secondary school performance. Most attention was given to the publication of OP scores in high schools, but a much wider range of information was provided at the same time, ranging from the number of students attending and the number of staff who were present to the vocational education and training achievements of that school, which is obviously also an incredibly important component of what our schools provide to students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024051"></A>
Our government has a good record in providing information to parents and communities about the performance of schools. This is now extending to the child-care sphere courtesy of this bill. As I said, there has been a large debate around this issue, most recently around the federal government’s My School website which has published a range of data on literacy and numeracy performance of schools. I personally believe that that website has had some teething problems, particularly where it attempts to compare one school to another. I think there have been some invalid comparisons between different schools around Australia. I am sure that as time goes on the federal government will tackle these teething problems and this resource will prove to be highly valuable not only for parents but also for schools themselves in trying to address their own performance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024054"></A>
A couple of weeks ago I was at a P&amp;C meeting at one of the high schools in the electorate I represent. They were talking about some of the new initiatives they are putting in place to try to improve the literacy and numeracy performance of their school. I will not mention the name of the high school, but it is a very good high school, as are all of the high schools in the electorate that I represent. They recognise that improvement is always possible. I think that they would probably admit that the publication of these literacy and numeracy results is one of the factors that has led to them deciding that they need to take further action around their literacy and numeracy performance and to always be looking at ways to assist their students achieve more highly in the area of literacy and numeracy. While we need to be careful with the publication of data, as long as appropriate safeguards are put in place it is a worthwhile objective and this bill accomplishes that in the area of child care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024055"></A>
The second element of the bill that I would like to discuss is the introduction of a literacy, numeracy or science test prior to someone being registered as a teacher. The Queensland government made a commitment last year to improve school performance following the results of the first national literacy and numeracy testing in 2008. These results were a wake-up call to our education systems at our schools. Literacy and numeracy are obviously the foundations of all learning and we need to lift performance to give our children the best chance in life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024056"></A>
Last year the government commissioned Professor Geoff Masters, an acknowledged international expert in education, to review performance in Queensland primary schools to find areas where we could make immediate improvements. His report emphasised that highly effective teaching requires teachers to have a strong knowledge in their subject areas and how to teach them. He also noted research and findings from his consultations that in many cases Queensland teachers did not feel adequately prepared particularly in areas such as the teaching of literacy and science. People undertaking teaching courses may not necessarily have a strong background in the area of science and yet we expect them, with minimal training in this field in their university studies, to be able to get out in front of a classroom and educate students in the area of science. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024057"></A>
There are obviously a number of things that the government is doing to provide further support and in-house training to our teachers to ensure that they do feel confident to teach these areas. In relation to this issue Professor Masters recommended that we should introduce a test so that all aspiring teachers would have to demonstrate their knowledge of literacy, numeracy and science content and their teaching techniques before they can be registered to teach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024058"></A>
Some may say that to qualify with an education degree would by necessity mean they have demonstrated their literacy, numeracy and science content skills. I know from personal experience that at times universities have not been very responsive to the needs of our education system in designing their education courses. Unfortunately, there are some instances--not many, but some instances--where, on graduating, teachers do not feel confident of their knowledge of the material that they are subsequently required to teach. Introducing this kind of test is a good way not of punishing those teachers but ensuring that they have the skills and the content knowledge they will need to front a classroom. If they do not have that knowledge then there are obviously things that the government and the Queensland College of Teachers can do to assist them to gain that knowledge so that they become highly effective teachers in our schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024059"></A>
The Queensland College of Teachers has been charged with developing and administering these tests. These legislative amendments will enable the college to implement the government’s commitment to introduce preregistration testing in response to Professor Master’s recommendation. They will enable the college to develop, trial and administer this testing program starting in late 2011. Queensland will lead Australia in requiring preservice teachers to sit a test and demonstrate threshold knowledge and skills before being registered. This type of testing already takes place in other countries that are, like Queensland, striving to raise student performance outcomes. For example, aspiring teachers in both England and the United States are required to sit literacy and numeracy tests before they can begin teaching. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024060"></A>
All of the Master’s review recommendations, including the introduction of testing of aspiring teachers, aim to improve results for Queensland students. The work of the college to implement these tests is a key step in improving our students’ performance in literacy, numeracy and science. This will contribute to providing a flying start for all Queensland students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024061"></A>
I end where I began: this government has an extremely proud record in the area of education and training. The Prime Minister likes to talk about an education revolution but I think we have had our own version of that in recent years in Queensland. The education system that we have in place in Queensland these days is completely different and an awful lot better than it was even five years ago, let alone what it was like in the dark ages when I went to school. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Mansfield. I did go to an excellent primary school in the electorate he represents. It gave me most skills, other than the ability to ignore interjections. As I say, this bill builds on the government’s record of achievement and introduces fantastic reforms that will continue to provide our students with a high-quality education. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.45 pm): I rise in support of the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. This bill amends the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005, herein referred to as the act, to recognise certain teaching experiences for the purpose of renewal of teacher registration. The child-care centres in the electorate of Mount Ommaney provide a great service, setting high standards with the support of local parents. It is important that teachers working in these centres are encouraged and supported. Under the current legislation, where Queensland Studies Authority approved and accredited syllabuses are taught, they must be taught by a registered teacher. However, while teachers delivering these programs in non-school settings are required to be registered, this teaching experience in a non-school setting has not been recognised for the purposes of renewing teacher registration. These teachers have had to be registered to deliver the education program but under the current legislation have not been able to rely on that teaching experience to renew their teacher registration. The bill corrects this anomaly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024066"></A>
The bill also clarifies an area of uncertainty regarding experiences that can be recognised when renewing teacher registration. The current act’s definition of teacher recognises ‘administering educational duties’. However, it has been unclear whether those teachers who have provided educational leadership, such as education advisers and the literacy and numeracy coaches engaged under the Council of Australian Government Smarter Schools National Partnership, would have such leadership experience recognised when applying to renew their teacher registration. This bill makes provision for such recognition, making these important leadership roles more attractive to high performing teachers. I commend the minister and the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (12.47 pm): Children are like wet cement: whatever falls on them makes an impression. I see no clear reason for the haste with which this bill has been introduced into the House for debate when the minister’s second reading speech only occurred in the last sitting of parliament. Before government members complain, a quick scan of the list of bills that have been relegated down seems to suggest another motive. Is the government or the minister trying to portray themselves as some kind of forward-thinking policemen of sorts or even fearful of the speed of change in an area such as education? There appears to be an unnecessary, almost indecent, haste to constrain the system by regulation. I am worried that it looks like the government wants to be seen to be doing something without examining the justifications for the legislative step. Specifically, the bill appears to have been overindulgent in adding even more layers to education areas, from child care to teacher qualifications, without any compensatory beneficial addition that comes with the changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024069"></A>
This raises the further concern that the government wishes to window dress its response to public concerns regarding difficulties that are periodically being reported as problems in specific circumstances. Rather than following a detailed careful approach to examining what problems there are, where they occur, who is involved and how best to treat them, this government’s response is, in the case of child care services, to implement logbooks and, in the case of teachers, to implement a system of testing teachers in literature, numeracy and science prior to registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024070"></A>
To examine the government’s response, one might also include a reasonable review of what is considered best practice in our global first-world society. One might also ask what government did on the basis of advice, that being the Master’s report in this case. Parts of that report have been highlighted by the member for Everton. I do not disagree with what it said.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024106"></A>
Did it choose the most favoured option so as to reduce its own budgetary outlay and merely transfer the costs back onto teachers themselves? Did the government baulk at the tougher choices because it wanted to be seen to be doing something whilst it did it? Procrastination and wasteful financial outlays are the norm in the current Labor administration. Twenty years of nothingness and management in crisis is how policy has ended up being rolled out. Do people realise that 20 years ago, in the most formative study that was completed, Queensland was the leader in maths and science in Australia? Now nationwide Queensland is second last in the government results alone and arguably it could be said to be lowest in the NAPLAN results. This closely approximates the results in health management and the status of Queenslanders when compared to other states. It is no wonder this government has finally realised it has to do something in literacy, numeracy and science. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024109"></A>
However, the government has discovered the value of science far too late in its life. It must have a very short memory. Several years ago when I was in parliament the former member for Inala, the father of the current member, derided a scientific approach when confronted on an issue relating to water management. He said, ‘Science has no answer for us. We have a better idea. It is a water grid and the Traveston Dam.’ We know what happened there. The member for Cairns described dams as ‘old technology’ and said ‘water comes from a tap’. Science is not always complex, but it is factually based. A purer definition is that science is about proof gathered by confirmation by experimentation, correctly conducted and recorded, and by reproducing the results. The Labor administration’s idea of science is to talk about it when the rest of the nation effectively damns it for ignoring it for so long. Similarly, the government’s belief in literacy is by saturating everyday people with propaganda such as this disgraceful state-wide personally mailed brochure outlining reasons why the state Labor government has the right to sell state assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024110"></A>
This is not what the teaching of literacy, numeracy and science is about. By its actions, Labor does not believe in such a serious approach to education. For many years it has embraced a belief in a dumbing-down approach to both educational standards and values. How things come back to haunt one when such a policy is implemented! Year after year schools have reduced mathematics standards and compulsory levels taught, there has been a conscious avoidance of national standards teaching, and the government has ignored what the teachers were genuinely saying. As a result, our students’ levels declined and nothing was done. It is tough when the screw turns. I predict that it will take a generation to turn this problem around. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024111"></A>
There has been far too great an emphasis on sport in schools at the expense of genuine education, yet far too little compulsory sport or even exercise occurs for the majority in our schools, that is, those who have no desire to become professional sports people. Now, one in five children aged below 15 are obese. Far too many students are falling through the gaps early in their schooling for reasons ranging from not being fed before school starts to terrible family circumstances. Teachers are asked to provide parenting but are unable to provide a reasonable education for the majority because of the multiple problems arising from individual students. It is almost as if children are being asked to learn for themselves. It it is all very well to teach children to learn how to acquire knowledge when they are young, but it is absolutely critical to assist them to learn both the correct techniques to do so and the essential skills that they need in life. Listening begins at the moment of birth and for most should only cease just moments before death. We never stop learning, but humans have a dreadful predisposition to learn bad habits. Sadly, laziness and ignorance are learned bad habits and they are difficult to correct. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If the member listened, she might learn something. To implement a top-down approach to manage a problem once identified without a parallel opposing bottom-up approach is fundamentally wrong. I was very interested to hear the Premier say that she is going to appoint extra science teachers and that the emphasis is on science, literacy and numeracy. However, the reality is that children are not continuing with science subjects in secondary and tertiary education. Mathematics is being reduced to a very secondary and basic level. If one excludes general maths in grades 11 and 12, it almost becomes an optional subject. Tragically, there is no longer a seat of mathematics at the University of Queensland. One cannot pursue a primary degree in mathematics at our major university. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024114"></A>
If we do not put enough students through both science and maths at schools, we will never have the teachers to provide the courses for children in everyday schooling. I know a little about this. My daughter, Caroline, teaches mathematics at university. She is studying towards a PhD in mechanical engineering in New South Wales. She pursued engineering because that is the major area where maths and science retain a powerful hold. I say, ‘Thank God for the engineers’, as they are not influenced by populism because they deal in reality. Professionally speaking, they live or die on their signing off of everything from large systems to simple constructions in everyday life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024115"></A>
Mathematics is the core skill for life. Personally, I have studied and enjoyed it for a lifetime. It endlessly challenges and surprises. Many do not realise that it is closely related to many other studies in life, including music. It is a fundamental part of science and, via information communications technology, represents a core critical part of our lives. Computers are operated in binary code at the level of machine code. At that level the maths is both simple and complex at one time. However, it is what you do with it that makes the difference. This is the same for children learning maths, taught correctly and endlessly. It is rather simple and, indeed, it is what one does with it that makes the difference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024116"></A>
To make the difference in mathematics, literacy and science, teachers, parents and the community all need to be travelling in the same direction. I do not believe that this is occurring now. Far too many social agendas are still being rolled out through our public schools that bear little resemblance to that which science students need as a fundamental base to their educational needs. Specifically, subjects such as SOSE have emerged that appeal to populism and not to a factually based status. At every level children who do not reach satisfactory levels, year after year, are being pushed through or diverted into the sorts of programs that allow for lower levels of educational attainment. Often parents do not realise this, although teachers do and fear for their jobs if they speak out. Children are the victims in this dreadful scenario. It is compounded by tolerance of behaviour that in many cases is grossly unacceptable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024117"></A>
Australia-wide there is a progress to private education as families shrink, incomes become mobile and parents worry about their children’s lives. For most the economic cost of this is too great, but it is what they want because they want a similarity in values and educational standards to those in private education. This is based on evidence based research that I will not fully detail in this speech today. Primarily private schools do not have to respond to state government masters and, as such, can demand standards of students and teachers on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. For many, they combine it with a heavy pastoral element. Their success must be copied for all our students in public schools where it is appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024118"></A>
In the recent NAPLAN test, many Queensland public schools did better or met equivalent standards to many private schools, but way too many fell far too far below in performance. We must truly copy all those models that are working and abandon those that are not working. This is the true lesson of NAPLAN and the formal listing of comparative school tables for parents. This must be the correct avenue for change, not only from the bottom but also from the top, and we should intervene at every level where an interventional step to assist improvement can be inserted relatively easily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024119"></A>
I wish to address more specifically the issue of literacy. I applaud the comments made by the Premier this morning. Parents need to encourage their children to read. Reading is one of life’s greatest pleasures. It builds on both a factual and a socioeconomic reference base from which an individual can both understand and appreciate life. Whilst all understand how critical it is to teach people to read and write, it may interest many to know how many in our present society, even with full free education, are unable to read and write. The most salient example is that 30 per cent of those in prisons are deemed to be illiterate and ATSI people now number high amongst those, whereas 20 years ago 90 per cent of them were deemed to be literate when they entered the prisons. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024120"></A>
Literacy is a key passport to life in a modern society. Without it one is denied entry to most things in life and is assured of a life in near poverty. The most recent example of what happens when a social experiment in literacy goes wrong has occurred in Australia--</Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 An example of what happens when a social experiment in literacy goes wrong is Wadeye in the Northern Territory, where over the last 10 years English was taught as a second language but it was not commenced until later primary school years and was not made compulsory thereafter. These children cannot read street signs, read things in shops or understand modern communication. They are excluded from everyday life. They are now too old to be largely recovered. It is a generation lost. That is the impact of failing to achieve a satisfactory level of literacy and English to grade 12 for those who finish at that level. It must be maintained as a mandatory requirement. It is equally important that teachers have proven satisfactory literacy levels that can be checked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029677"></A>
I found it rather compelling that during my speech here this afternoon members were seeking to know what more I could offer in the way of advice on the bottom-up approach that needs to be embraced in dealing with this very serious issue. I need look no further than the schools and kindergartens in my local area. The Nerang State School P&amp;C meeting was held last week and I have also had conversations with my local child-care providers. I thank the outgoing chair of the Nerang State School P&amp;C, Fiona Dryden; the incoming chair of the Nerang State School P&amp;C, Carol Randall; and the director of the Small World Child Care Centre in Carrara, Julie Fox. This is a more grassroots approach. What they said was that teachers need more in-class support. They need a greater range of materials and funded teacher aides. They need budgets for electricity to be able to afford to run the air conditioning and stop children overheating in classes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029684"></A>
Nerang State School has been granted the right to be involved in the Stephanie Alexander cook-what-you-grow-at-school program. They now need a budget to be able to build a garden that can supply enough of a diverse range of vegetables to feed the children. They also need a room that is set up as a commercial kitchen that is child friendly, where a child can learn not only what to eat but also how to grow it and how to cook it. They all know what they like. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029685"></A>
The school also needs a pool because it is in the Nerang hinterland and the local Nerang pool is not as close as it could be--there are some major roads between the school and the pool--and the lessee of the pool has increased their charges and it is too expensive to go there. On the Gold Coast it is even more important to learn to swim due to the high number of homes that have pools and also our coastal location. Also, teachers need to have upskilling to deal with children from Pacific islands whose primary language is not English as they need to raise their literacy levels substantially. It is not about teachers needing to have their registration checked; it is about upskilling the teachers and paying for that upskilling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029688"></A>
In child care, the log of compliance is seen as a scare tactic for the public. Most centres think it will be a nightmare to implement and run. The logs are about the most trivial things. Examples that were given were: a parent reporting a spoon left out on a bench or a staff member without a hat on their head outside, even if it is raining. It is not actually an offence or anything other than the most trivial of things. Parents are thinking it is something else. The centres all believe that nothing beneficial will come of it and it will be irrelevant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029690"></A>
Child-care centres and kindergartens in my electorate--and I have 23--all feel that the government rollout of the program is about having super-duper kindies. It is all about style over substance. One compared it to super-duper medical clinics. They all said that this was an excessive duplication of service when in fact it is not about service delivery. It is all very well to build these kindies, but what will they provide? Why are they being built beside existing centres? What was needed was more funding for child-care services. The government needed to provide funding for teachers’ wages and that funding needs to be recurrent. All of them said that you cannot generalise with children and that, equally, one cannot compare areas of service easily because socioeconomic status and literacy levels of parents make a significant difference. Even within one area, there can be significant differences over a distance of just 500 metres or so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029694"></A>
So what comes out of that? We should not generalise with children. More and more service provision is what is needed and we should not constrict it. Logbooks are a distraction. Why are we scaring parents? And we need to raise all levels of literacy and numeracy, including those of parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029695"></A>
Like the shadow minister, I support the bill, but my aspirational requirements of the bill would have been far greater. I feel that the government bill is reflective of the theme that the government has consistently rolled out. It attempts to use heavy-handed, user-pays approaches for the industry to address populist demand when what was called for was an integrated partnership based, inspired professional approach built on a theme of pursuing excellence and innovation. I think logbooks are a pedestrian approach to child-care compliance. Equally I am concerned that some of the changes look like they are seeking to exclude teachers, especially supply teachers and others who generally add to the skill and pool base of our education system. I see very little benefit in the state duplicating kindergartens in an area such as my own in Gaven when there is a nearby kindergarten at Merrimac where existing services still have available spaces. </Hansard-Body>

Ms MALE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pine Rivers--ALP) (2.36 pm): I rise this afternoon to support the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. This piece of legislation is another step in meeting the Bligh government’s commitment to a quality and accountable education system in Queensland. It is about ensuring that parents have access to information that will enable them to make informed decisions about our most precious young Queenslanders. It is about ensuring that our teachers are fully equipped and tested to teach our kids every day. And it is about ensuring that our children get a flying start to education with quality checked early childhood teachers. This government prioritises the education of our children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029704"></A>
We have introduced a new year of schooling, we are building 240 new kindies and we have had the largest spend on school building works ever. As Parliamentary Secretary for Education, I am very pleased to be speaking about this bill and the many benefits it will have for Queensland parents and children alike. As a parent, I understand that choosing the appropriate care for your child is a very difficult decision. The bill before the House is designed to give parents another tool to assist them in making this really big decision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029706"></A>
The Bligh government has made a strong commitment to transparency and accountability in government. In this same vein, it is time that ECEC services are held accountable for the quality of their service. Queensland will be the first state in Australia to introduce a logbook of this kind. Once again we are leading the way. The Bligh government is at the cutting edge of compliance reform and we will pave the way for other states to complement the new national reforms in this area. At a national level, new standards for services are being introduced, and Queensland is taking this one step further so that parents can access important information about early childhood services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029707"></A>
Literacy, numeracy and science are the foundations of every child’s education. The Bligh government made a commitment to reform education in Queensland when it commissioned Professor Geoff Masters to review primary school education. We are keeping that commitment. Preregistration testing is a clear recommendation of the Masters report and will ensure that every teacher has a demonstrated ability to teach literacy, numeracy and science before they enter the classroom.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029709"></A>
Our results in the recent NAPLAN tests show that we are improving, but we still have a long way to go. That is why we are introducing this bill today, that is why we have released a green paper which talks about moving year 7s to a specialised teaching environment and that is why we are introducing a suite of initiatives to improve outcomes in Queensland education. In addition, we have proposed a review of the quality of teacher training courses provided by Queensland universities. Queensland parents should expect quality teaching in our state schools and the Bligh government is going to deliver that quality.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029710"></A>
Research shows that the early years of a child’s life are the most important. Queensland has been focusing on early childhood education and working with the federal government to deliver the biggest ever reforms to this sector. The amendments before the House today go to recognise early childhood teachers as qualified professionals to be registered. Registration acts as an additional check on teachers and it is important that teachers teaching a kindergarten program are able to be registered. This complements the commitment by the Queensland government to deliver universal access to kindergarten by 2014. Recognising ECEC teachers as registered is the first step, and we will look to mandate registration in the future so that every early childhood teacher is required to be registered.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029711"></A>
This bill is an important plank in improving the quality of care for our youngest Queenslanders and in ensuring our teachers are fully equipped to educate a new generation of Queenslanders. As a parent, I urge everyone here to support the bill and, as a person and a member with a commitment to the future of our state, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029750"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (2.39 pm): I rise to support the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. This is an important bill because education is the keystone that will deliver future success for Queensland children. The quality of our education system and the quality of education received by our children reflects directly on their quality of life as adults. Studies have also shown that the biggest influence in the quality of education received is the quality of the teaching. The first five years of a child’s life is the time when they have the capacity to learn most rapidly, and both the quantity and quality of their learning during this time creates the capacity for greater learning for the rest of their lives. It is, therefore, vital that the state government ensures that all Queensland children have the highest quality learning experiences from their earliest years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029752"></A>
Early learning experiences are not just about formal learning. Early learning is about creating rich learning environments and experiences, such as creating a stimulating and exciting environment that children can interact with, discuss with their friends and recreate, and then they can learn from that and grow. For young children, play is their vehicle for learning, and the quality of the experience that a child might have in play is increased by giving children a purpose for an activity. Can you build a tower that is as tall as yourself? What happens if you do this? They are then focused on finding out if something works.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029753"></A>
For these reasons, it is vital that people working in child-care centres are qualified to enrich learning experiences for children. It is for this reason that the Bligh government is working to improve the training of supervisors in kindergartens and child-care centres. It is not just about an activity; it is about framing the activity to focus children on developing predetermined concepts which form the basis of the knowledge they will need to accelerate into formal learning at a later stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029754"></A>
This bill amends the definition of ‘teacher’ to include people who supervise children in child-care centres and kindergartens that undertake an education program but are not schools. This includes recognising teachers in leadership roles, such as principals in schools, and in other organisations like kindergartens, child-care centres and TAFE. It is likely that in the future there will be formal training expectations for all Queensland teachers in kindergartens and child-care centres to ensure there will be quality learning experiences for children from a much earlier age.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029755"></A>
In this bill, kindergarten programs will be accredited by the QSA to be delivered in the year before the prep year. This bill also ensures that the licensee of kindergartens and child-care centres complies with the licence specifications and records their compliance issues in a logbook that must be available to parents and community members at all times. This means that if a child-care centre has a compliance notice issued against it, it must be recorded in its logbook for the scrutiny of all parents of clients in the centre. Similarly, amendments or suspensions of their licence must also be recorded in their logbook. This is an important avenue for providing an open and transparent child-care service. At a time when a growing number of parents are entrusting their children to the care of kindergartens and child-care centres, it is vital that parents feel confident in the quality of the care their children are getting. The training of teachers is paramount for us to achieve the highest quality education for students.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029758"></A>
This bill introduces preregistration testing in literacy, numeracy and science for new primary school teachers to ensure they have the capacity to facilitate learning to a high standard in the classroom. For teachers renewing their registration after a break in service, there is a renewal provision to ensure they have kept up with current teaching practice and have recent teaching experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029759"></A>
This bill also provides that teachers may have their registration renewed without a ‘returning to teaching’ condition if they have been practising as a teacher--such as, for example, working in a kindergarten or a child-care centre--or if the teacher has attained experience that is recognised as relevant to teaching for the required time frame. The provisions of this bill are about adding details to the broad sweep of education legislation that will value-add to our current processes for the training and skilling of our teachers and to the development of kindergartens and child-care centres as learning centres for our children as well as places they come to when their parents are working.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029760"></A>
Queensland has high-quality teaching staff and programs and I am proud of the quality of work they do. Queenslanders have been very well represented among university graduates and industry leaders, but now the Bligh government is ramping up expectations for teachers and learning organisations to ensure Queenslanders will continue to be competitive when they leave their formal education. I believe the professionalism of our teachers and our teacher training means they have the capacity to encompass these changes and they will be able to ramp up their outcomes to produce results that in the future are the best in the country. Kindergartens and child-care centres will become rich sources of learning for our young children and will give them the flying start to their formal education that will see them become even more successful than they have been in the past.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029761"></A>
I am surprised at the comments from the members opposite about this bill. They do not agree with provisions in this bill and they do not agree with other measures we have put in place to ensure our children have the quality educational outcomes they need, but the LNP has no alternatives. Is the education of our children important to them? Actions, after all, do speak louder than words. I would like to thank the minister for his detailed planning and vision that will deliver not only a flying start for Queensland children but a better landing when they exit their formal education. This bill is a pivotal piece in the big picture of Queensland’s education legislation. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029764"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (2.48 pm): It is a pleasure to speak on the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010 today. We live in a world which is increasing in complexity, with children born today facing life in a very challenging world. We also importantly require transparency, accountability and, as much as is humanly possible, assurances that when our children are in the care of others--be they in child care or at school--they are receiving not only the best of care but also the best educational foundation for their future development.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029765"></A>
This government is progressively introducing safeguards and innovation into our child-care sector. Earlier this month, the website of the Department of Education and Training gained the right to publish details of child-care centres guilty of serious noncompliance which they have failed to rectify. This bill will now move to the next phase of ensuring that parents have access to information regarding the child-care centre their child attends or a centre they are investigating for future child-care services for their child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029791"></A>
This will apply to long-day-care centres and kindergartens as well as family day care conducted in private homes. The one service not included is after-school care. Each centre will be required to have a logbook, which is available to parents on request, that will record any compliance notices as well as when issues are addressed and notices lifted. I would like to mention that most centres are of a very high standard, and it is not envisaged that there will be a high number of reported issues. However, we must be constantly vigilant.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029797"></A>
It is also an important initiative that each pre-prep year will have a four-year trained teacher following a set curriculum to increase children’s readiness to commence school in the prep year. The announcement of 240 additional kindergartens throughout the state to give this opportunity to many more children is indicative of how serious this government is about the early years of education.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029798"></A>
The issue of literacy and numeracy as well as science has been highlighted recently at both the federal and state level as requiring new direction and renewed vigour in our schools. However, we all know that education starts way before a child goes to school. I must commend the Premier on her initiative for each new mother in the state to receive a children’s book to encourage reading to their child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029800"></A>
As a result of the Masters’ review, one recommendation included in the bill is that teacher graduates seeking registration be given literacy, numeracy and science testing from the end of 2011. These areas of teaching are the basic building blocks for future learning, and it is thus vital that all of our teachers have these basic skills. We are serious about ensuring that our young students are given the skills and every encouragement to succeed in our schooling system. When I visit my schools, I am encouraged by the positive enthusiasm of teachers and principals. My schools are all national partnership schools so have additional funding for innovative programs. I believe we will see huge improvements in educational outcomes in future years, with both the federal government and our state government placing such emphasis and resources in the areas which matter most. I have much pleasure in commending the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (2.52 pm): Today I rise to make a brief contribution to the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill. I will be supporting the bill but, like many others before me, there will be both compliments and concerns. I do have some questions which the minister might answer in his summing-up or at the consideration in detail stage. I will flag some of the issues now. Others have been raised by other members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029804"></A>
I noted in the minister’s second reading speech that the bill has three objectives. One was to require licensees of child-care services to keep compliance history logbooks. The second was to implement a system for testing of persons in literacy, numeracy or science prior to their registering as teachers or prior to registering them as teachers. I appreciate that applies to new applicants in late 2011. The third was to recognise certain teacher registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029805"></A>
We all, as elected members, when we wander around a community go and talk to those people who are most likely to be affected. In this case I talked to teachers, I talked to people involved in the kindergarten industry and I talked to parents. They are not all brimming with confidence. They are not all absolutely certain that this is a great step forward. They all admire the initial motivation behind the legislation, but beyond that is where they get a little concerned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029806"></A>
I will move to the first objective. Everyone would support in principle the strategy that sets out to protect and improve our child’s education and safety outcomes. I do, however, question the cost associated with this--the cost of time and personnel, and the cost in maintaining those logbooks. That time taken by staff and management is time which comes at a cost, and it is time which is not spent on the very people they are charged with educating, supervising and looking after. As I say, I agree in principle with the extra information to prospective parents and to parents of enrolled children, but it has been my experience throughout life that this government has a history of thinking things up but failing to think them through. Again, there is detail that is lacking here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029807"></A>
I remind the House again that time is money. While the government has vowed and declared that the money will not come from the state, someone will be picking up the tab. This is at a time when the industry has already undergone some changes through regulation and processes, and those costs are still being borne and rippling through. Now we are adding this new layer of misery in many circumstances. More importantly, there is no real measure of an outcome. There is no quantifiable way of measuring that, if we do this, this, and this, our children will be better served and that the outcomes will be beneficial.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029808"></A>
This is confirmation that Labor has let down our children in the education provided to them over 20 years, because Labor has been in power for 20 years. Child safety is a motherhood statement--nothing more and nothing less. We all rally to it, but I do not see in this any great step forward or any quantum leap in addressing some of those issues. I see no real action, and that is quite typical of legislation that comes before this place. With the inclusion of issues such as trivial font sizes, this type of legislation becomes irrelevant and ludicrous. I again raise concerns, because when you get down to that level of micromanagement you are losing focus on the big picture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029810"></A>
Again, the second objective is admirable, but it begs the question: how could anyone who has qualified as a teacher--albeit a currently serving teacher in a casual or part-time arrangement--and who requires a new registration next year not be competent in literacy or numeracy at a primary school level? It seems to be just another new hurdle with nothing more than a feel-good factor or a headline. How on earth could someone go through 16 years of education under Labor in this state, come out university graduated as a teacher and not pass the basic numeracy, literacy or science qualification to teach our children? There is something wrong. We have had 20 years of Labor, so do not be critical of this side of the House. Those opposite have been at the wheel but they have been asleep at the wheel. You are the ones who have failed the education system, you have failed our teachers and you have failed our system. That is where the buck stops. I have heard the words ‘the buck stops’ a few times today, but it starts and ends with Labor. Do not look at this side. Look in the mirror if you are looking for fault and blame. I do applaud some of these measures, because anything you can do that is a step in the right direction--albeit you have been sprinting in the wrong direction for 20 years, and we are now starting to walk in the right direction--is a step forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029812"></A>
I suspect that new graduates will be forced to pay, because we are not paying. The educational institutions can take their pick because there are so many teachers and so few positions out there. So the education system will not be picking up the tab for the test. New, prospective teachers will be the ones picking up the tab. What we do not know yet is how much that test might be, how onerous that test might be and the circumstances surrounding it. The graduates from late 2011 will certainly be caught up in that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029813"></A>
I say to the minister that we understand literacy and numeracy. If there are some issues concerning the competency of teachers coming out the other end of this state education system, I wonder whether history, geography or other disciplines might be added to the system later to ensure that those we empower to teach our children have some baseline knowledge and can pass that test themselves. I do accept that there may be immigrants or migrants who have a different standard, and some assessment should be undertaken prior to any registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029814"></A>
In closing, I remind those opposite that our children have not been served well under Labor. Even the Premier had a stint as minister for education, and our children when compared to other states did not measure up well. It is Labor that has caused that--not the teachers. They, too, have been failed by Labor. It is the curriculum that has been laid down by Labor that has failed our children. Teachers who have spent 16 years under a Labor education system have not been served well, and now we are asking the teachers who will qualify to pick up the tab for their test.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032649"></A>
All we really see here is no confidence, on the part of my community, in Labor and the education system. We also see another layer of bureaucracy being added. I suspect there will be countless people employed in those areas to count beans, measure beans and weigh beans. At the end of the day, that does not contribute to the educational outcomes of our children and that is deplorable. There are no measurable outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032652"></A>
There is no way to actually determine whether anything in this bill makes a damn bit of difference--the tiniest jot of difference. That seems to be typical of legislation that comes into parliament. It is well intentioned, well meaning, well dreamt up but not well planned and not well executed. That is where we let ourselves down. This is compounded by the fact that there is no real commitment from Labor and no funding going into supporting any of this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032653"></A>
It will be our children and our children’s children who will pick up the tab when they come out of 16 years of education under Labor and cannot read. We need to blame Labor. We need to blame the Premier. We need to blame this government. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.00 pm): I rise to speak on the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. There are few more important jobs than looking after the welfare and development of our young children. Teachers, carers, child-care workers and teacher aides are some of the most critical workers in our community. As parents, we hand our children over to them day after day, week after week, year after year and trust that they will do their very best. As parents, we also trust that the government will put systems in place to ensure our children are looked after well and in such a way that they will be happy, fulfilled and able to reach their full potential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032657"></A>
This government has a proud record in education and early childhood. The earn or learn strategy, among other things, has seen Queensland become one of the most active participants in Australia, compared to the other states and territories, in school based traineeships and apprenticeships. We have also seen the introduction of the prep year, the rollout of 240 new kindergartens across the state by 2014--and I am very grateful that one of those is in my electorate and attached to the Seven Hills State School--and the focus on literacy and numeracy. These achievements are already on the record. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032661"></A>
Now, with the recently announced initiatives under the banner of the Flying Start for Queensland Children we will see a renewed focus on providing the best possible opportunities for children in their early years. The transition of year 7 to secondary school, the early reading initiatives, the quality assurance across all education sectors--these new proposed reforms--are causing great excitement in the Bulimba electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032662"></A>
This bill will lay important foundations for some of the Flying Start initiatives. One of its objectives is to implement a system for the testing of persons in literacy, numeracy or science prior to their registration as teachers. This government makes no apology for expecting the highest standards for the environment in which we place our children. We know that well prepared teachers and excellent curriculum are some of the key ingredients to learning. I know, from speaking to the many excellent teachers in the schools of the Bulimba electorate, that teachers expect this of themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032663"></A>
The provision in this bill which implements the Masters recommendation that all aspiring primary teachers should be required to demonstrate, through test performances, that they meet threshold knowledge levels for the teaching of literacy, numeracy and science and sound content knowledge in these areas prior to registration as a teacher will be an important step in ensuring that our teachers are as well prepared as possible for their task. This, along with the proposal under Flying Start that the government review the quality of teacher training courses provided by Queensland universities and the support provided by schools to beginning teachers, will bring a comprehensive approach to ensuring that we have the building blocks right to provide a high-quality learning environment for our students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032664"></A>
It is hard being a teacher. The learning environment is complex and demanding and there are a range of student abilities to tend to. By supporting our new teachers with the appropriate training, support and accreditation and by not leaving our teachers vulnerable when they first enter the classroom we are doing the right thing by everyone--the teachers, the parents and carers and, most importantly, the students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032665"></A>
In addition to providing a high-quality learning environment, it is critical that as a government we are taking all steps to ensure there is a safe learning environment for our children. I wish to refer specifically in this regard to the objective of this bill which requires licensees of child-care services, other than school-age care services, to keep compliance history logbooks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032667"></A>
This government is committed to openness and transparency. We have already seen the passing last year of amendments to the Child Care Act to enable the Department of Education and Training to publish information on its website about early childhood education and care services that demonstrate serious noncompliance. The requirements regarding logbooks in this bill will now ensure parents and carers will have information about the quality of a service so they can make informed decisions before they book their child into a service and also monitor the service over the period in which their child is attending. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032670"></A>
These and the previous measures will honour longstanding commitments that have been made by the Queensland government since March 2007 to provide parents with access to information about non-compliant child-care services. It will also align with the national early child development reform agenda which has a strong focus on improving the quality of services and parental access to meaningful information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032672"></A>
This government again makes no apology for requiring the highest standards for our children in terms of a safe environment. Again, I fail to see how the members opposite can disagree with the bill in this regard. Like many members in this House, I speak to hundreds of parents every week. I am a parent myself. When I looked at child-care centres for my daughter the most basic consideration for me was safety. There is not one parent I know or have met who does not want to make sure their children are in a safe and supportive environment. I cannot imagine that it is any different in an electorate held by an LNP member. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032674"></A>
As a parent, particularly as a first-time parent, who might often not be aware of all the questions they need to ask, it is extremely useful to have as much information as possible about the place where one’s children will be entrusted. This is what the logbooks will provide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032676"></A>
There are numerous child-care providers operating in my electorate. I have spoken to many of them during the progress of this and the previous related bill. They are not frightened of being open and transparent. In fact, many of them already have systems in place to make sure parents are informed of any issues occurring at their centres. Many of them are very pleased that the early childhood sector is being afforded the attention it is by the state government and that it is being recognised for the services it provides to children at the most important time in their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032678"></A>
In talking about child-care centres, I would like to make particular mention of the Bulimba Child Care Centre. I hold this centre up as a model of care for young children. This is vindicated by the people of Bulimba and surrounding suburbs in the form of the extremely long waiting list which is in place there. I would like to thank Bev Book and Karen Brookfield, the co-directors of the centre, and the members of the management committee at the centre for the many hours they have spent with me giving me their ideas and providing a sounding board on early childhood issues in our local community and beyond, including most recently regarding the Flying Start initiatives around the Ready Reader and parental involvement programs. I have great faith in their expertise and judgement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032682"></A>
This is an excellent bill which establishes yet another plank in the ongoing raft of initiatives being put in place by this government to provide the best possible start for Queensland children and young people. I congratulate the Minister for Education and Training for his passion on this subject and I commend this bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 (Broadwater--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.08 pm): I rise in support of the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. This government is very committed to providing parents with information about licensed early childhood education and care services that fail to comply with the Child Care Act 2002. The government is taking a staged approach to this issue. The first stage, which commenced on 1 February 2010, enables the Department of Education and Training to publish information on its website about the ECEC services which demonstrate serious or repeated noncompliance that is more than minor in nature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035373"></A>
The second stage of amendments, which are the subject of this bill, will require licensed ECEC services to keep a compliance history logbook which will be available for inspection by any person at the service. These legislative changes are focused on services that primarily care for children under school age. However, the department is also exploring whether the website publication scheme and logbook requirements should also apply to school-age care services. This initiative will provide parents, guardians and the wider community with easy access to information about whether their local ECEC service is meeting minimum legislated standards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035379"></A>
Access to this information will particularly assist parents when it comes to making the sometimes difficult decision about which education service their child should attend. We know that in the majority of cases these service providers deliver quality care to our children by meeting child-care laws, but the logbooks of these providers will demonstrate their commitment to the provision of quality care because they will contain no or very little information about noncompliance by the licensee. However, for the small number of licensees who do contravene the act and who receive formal notices about such contraventions, the obligation to record this information in their logbook will ensure that parents and guardians can be informed of the licensee’s compliance history. In some cases, knowing this information may of course influence a parent’s decision about whether they feel comfortable with the quality of care a service provides and therefore whether they feel comfortable about having their child attend that service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035384"></A>
We also anticipate that the introduction of this scheme will motivate service providers to maintain their already high standard of care or, if they are one of the providers whose services are not always up to scratch, lift their game. We believe that licensees will be even more keen to do the right thing, not only in the interests of providing safe, supportive and nurturing care environments for children but also to ensure they are not required to enter information in their logbook about formal notices, which will be available for parents’ scrutiny. Therefore, the scheme is expected to encourage greater sector accountability and drive a culture of continuous improvement. This should raise the overall standard of ECEC in Queensland and strengthen parents’ confidence in the services in general.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035388"></A>
The requirement to keep a compliance history logbook will apply to, firstly, licensed centre based services such as long day care, kindergartens and limited hours care and, secondly, all home based child-care services--that is, family day care. Generally, information that licensees must record in their logbook will include the name by which the service is known and the address of the service, details about the enforcement action that was taken--for example, if it was the issuing of a compliance notice or the amendment, urgent amendment or suspension or urgent suspension of a licence--the reason the enforcement action was taken as well as information about any steps the person may take to remedy the contravention. Licensees will also have to update their logbook to indicate when a suspension has been lifted or the steps the licensee took to rectify a contravention. The information must remain in the logbook for as long as the licensee holds a licence for that service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035395"></A>
I am aware that the department of education continues to work collaboratively with the ECEC sector to ensure providers meet standards without having to give a compliance notice or take more serious enforcement action. In the 2009-10 year to date, 5,077 monitoring visits were made across the state. The results of the visits so far have revealed a very high level of compliance. Based on 2009-10 year-to-date compliance data, only 31 from around 2,000 licensed early childhood education and care services would have been required to record information in their logbook. This logbook scheme will give parents greater certainty about the quality of an ECEC service and the extent to which a service meets the minimum legislated standards. Therefore, not only will this bill benefit parents and the wider community; it is anticipated that the changes will also be of benefit to the ECEC sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035398"></A>
I want to comment on the contribution made by the member for Mudgeeraba and the concern that this bill will put a lot of bureaucratic paperwork in front of our service providers. I do not think that is entirely true. The bill before the House today clearly lays out that if our child-care services provide a level of care that meets the requirements they will not need to put anything in their logbook. If the member for Mudgeeraba has really talked to her constituents about the proposal in this bill then I have to disagree with her, because many residents that I have spoken to, particularly parents, feel that this is a way for the industry to lift its game. It also gives great comfort for those services that are doing the right thing that our officers will now be concentrating on those in the sector that are not doing the right thing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035402"></A>
The other aspect of the logbook is that it will meet the needs of people who do not have access to the web. There are still many people who do not have a computer in their home, and we need to provide that information and give them access to it. There are many people to whom providing a logbook they can access at the centre to which they take their children is of great importance so that they can have that information and be well informed. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--LNP) (3.16 pm): The Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010 makes amendments to the Child Care Act 2002 to require compliance history logbooks to be kept by child-care services catering for non-school-age kids and also amends the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005 to implement literacy, numeracy or science testing for teachers before they can be registered. This side of the House will agree to both amendments because they offer, if managed properly, an increased chance to improve the educational standards of Queensland children and their safety.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035411"></A>
I congratulate the minister and those opposite for introducing this bill. I also congratulate our shadow minister for his assessment of this legislation and wise advice. I also congratulate the members for Mudgeeraba, Gaven and Redlands, who have accurately described the size of the educational hole that we have dug ourselves into over the last 20 years. This bill is proof of the size of that hole and, of course, the Labor Party’s failures. The Premier and especially the long-serving members opposite share the responsibility for the poor numeracy and literacy standards of our children. I do not take any joy in saying that, because it is a sad fact that many children have not reached their full potential or realised their dreams because of a policy failure by a political party.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035413"></A>
The aim of the amendment to the Child Care Act is to increase information available to parents about issues relating to their children’s safety, thereby increasing accountability and the child’s safety. As the shadow minister has said, this is summed up by the phrase ‘the parents’ right to information’, which we agree with and which is one of our principles. However, that is not to say that this government initiative should not be approached with caution, because it does create more paperwork for child-care centres. It is another layer of bureaucracy, and the costs and benefits must be carefully scrutinised and monitored closely.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035417"></A>
For a balanced point of view, I will provide two pieces of community feedback. One appeared in a <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 article titled ‘Fears red tape will hurt child care’. Gwynn Bridge, the President of Childcare Queensland, said that the introduction of the log system could result in child carers becoming focused on compliance rather than looking after children. Ms Bridge is quoted as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1035421"></A>
My major concern is that across Queensland we have many educational zones, which are all inspected by different compliance officers ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1035422"></A>
It is known some of these officers can be pedantic and over-zealous, which leads to paranoia among child care operators and staff.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1035423"></A>
There needs to be consistency if the log system is to work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038191"></A>
However, Ms Lyn Albury, a teacher of 15 years at the Palmwoods Community Kindergarten, is reported as saying that she was fully supportive of the state government’s new logbook system, which will allow members of the public to access information about child-care centre staff and safety issues. She believes that any measures to make child-care providers more accountable has to be a good thing. ‘I have nothing to worry about and other providers who are doing things right don’t either,’ said Ms Albury. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038193"></A>
It is a little bit deceptive that those opposite would paint us as being total knockers of these initiatives. We are here to support these initiatives, but we are here in the Queensland parliament to properly scrutinise these measures that have been put forward by the government. We are doing our job. We are holding the government to account.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038194"></A>
As we have heard, child-care centres have already been hit with changes that have been made recently and are struggling to keep up with the impact of the introduction of prep year and the threat of a pre-prep year and the impending implementation of the national guidelines. Centres are bearing the increased costs associated with these changes and face decreased revenue through changed guidelines and a decreasing range of services. In order to illustrate that point of the increasing costs for child-care centres, I would like to share with the House and the minister correspondence from a local child-care service provider that I have, and which I am sure is covered by this legislation. The hardworking president of the South Kolan kindy, Tanya Jones, wrote the following to me--and other members of parliament--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038198"></A>
Dear Members of Parliament,</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038199"></A>
We are writing to you about the recent announcement of changes to the Department of Education Kindergarten Assistance Scheme (DEKAS). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038200"></A>
We represent a small rural C&amp;K community kindergarten situated north of Bundaberg. The kindy has been operating for 40 years and services a radius of about 20km. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038201"></A>
Although we can have up to 22 children enrolled, it has been some seven or eight years since we have had full enrolments. Our target age group is 3.5-4.5 year olds, or those attending prep in the following years. However, to increase our enrolment numbers we always also enrol children as they turn three. This also secures enrolments for the following year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038202"></A>
Because of our lower enrolment numbers, our volunteer management committee needs to fundraise quite large amounts to keep our budget balanced. For example, at this time of year we have 16 children enrolled, but started the year with 12 children. Of those 16 children, eight are pre-prep and eight are 3 year olds. Our fundraising target this year has been $12,000 with these numbers, which is very difficult for such a small group of people. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038203"></A>
We operate for two days per week and employ a qualified early childhood teacher and a qualified assistant. Our DEKAS funding has been about 80% of wages, not including long service leave and sick pay, which is about $36,300.00 this year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038204"></A>
The new funding model for DEKAS which comes into effect in 2011 will fund per child and will only fund children in a pre-prep age group (3.5-4.5 years). This will have a profound affect on the viability of our kindy, as we rely heavily on our 3 year old enrolments to provide additional income through fees. The new funding model will see us getting $2,625.00 for each pre-prep child. If we go on this year’s numbers in term 4, that would be only $21,000.00. This is a difference of $15,300.00 from what we are receiving at present. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038205"></A>
Our small rural kindergartens in our region are in a similar situation, with 3 years old enrolments filling up enrolment spaces to produce extra income for the kindy. At no time did the 3 year olds take spaces away from the pre-prep target group. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038206"></A>
Wallaville C&amp;K kindy at present have seven pre-prep and nine 3 year olds. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038207"></A>
Biggenden C&amp;K kindy at present have seven pre-prep children and seven 3 year olds. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038208"></A>
Gin Gin C&amp;K kindy at present have fourteen pre-prep children and six 3 year olds. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038209"></A>
As you can imagine, being funded only for the pre-prep children will adversely affect all of these small rural kindergartens, who also have to fundraise within the present funding model to keep their budgets balanced. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038210"></A>
We are asking the members of parliament to look at this new funding model and reconsider the decision to only fund the pre-prep children, especially in circumstances where the kindergarten is relying on the financial support that 3 years old enrolments give to the organisation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038211"></A>
It must also be noted that because kindy has always been available to 3 years olds in these rural areas, parents may seek other options for their 3 year olds and then not send them to the local kindy when they are of pre-prep age. This would also lose these kindergarten enrolments who desperately need the fees from these children to reduce their fundraising targets. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038212"></A>
We implore you give this matter your due consideration. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038215"></A>
The amendments to the Education Queensland (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005 introduce a literacy and numeracy testing scheme for teachers prior to registration. This was a recommendation by the education researcher Professor Geoff Masters as a result of his review into Queensland’s failure in literacy and numeracy testing. The aim is to lift literacy and numeracy standards in Queensland. Although the preregistration testing of teachers in literacy and numeracy and science is supported, the LNP notes that this action alone will not provide a solution to the literacy and numeracy problems that are currently being experienced in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038219"></A>
On 20 June, 2009 the president of the Queensland Teachers Union, Steve Ryan, stated in an online article for the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 that the tests were a band-aid solution to a more complex problem. He stated further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038221"></A>
It’s a much larger issue... What should occur is an investment in education and providing the resources that teachers need in those classrooms. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038222"></A>
For some of the students who are underachieving and not reaching those literacy benchmarks, they need to be in smaller classes, they need to have better resourcing in terms of help and they are just not getting it. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038223"></A>
I agree wholeheartedly with Steve Ryan, and I say that from a personal point of view. I honestly believe that both sides of politics need to find a way to significantly boost teachers’ pay accompanied with a significant increase in professional and academic standards. That is why I am very excited about the provisions in this bill, because they are a small step towards increasing those professional and academic standards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038224"></A>
One of the issues relating to literacy also relates to the issue of school discipline. I think we need to introduce higher standards of discipline in our schools. Some schools are getting it; some schools are not. As part of that higher standard of discipline, I think we should have a zero illicit drugs and weapons policy, which I will speak about later. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038226"></A>
There is a teacher, Mrs Lex Black, whose 54 years of service this year deserves to be recognised in this place during this debate. On her own, Mrs Black has significantly contributed to the betterment of the numeracy and literacy skills of many thousands of Queenslanders. If the minister is serious about positive and effective educational reform, he will contact Mrs Black, who is or was relieving at Oakwood State School today, and organise a time to sit down and talk with her about the lessons that she has learned in education over the past 54 years. I cannot think of a teacher who is more respected and loved by thousands and thousands of students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038228"></A>
At this point I have to declare an interest: Mrs Black was my grade 1 teacher at South Kolan State School in 1976. I had the pleasure of bumping into Mrs Black down the street and we talked about those 54 years and some of her memories. We talked about the whole revolution that came about when we went from phonics to learning whole words and the mixture in between and the coloured blocks that we used to have in grades 1 and 2. I would like to detail for the House some of Mrs Blacks’s service. Mrs Black spent one year in teachers college. From 1955 to 1959, her first posting was at the Bundaberg Central State School. From 1959 to 1964, she was at Mount Isa and then transferred to Townview State School, which is also in Mount Isa. From 1965 to 1993, Mrs Black taught at South Kolan State School, where she gave wonderful service. In 1993 she retired and then relieved at 20 country schools. Like me, Mrs Black is of the belief that country towns and country schools are the best places in which to raise children and give them an education. In 2000, once again Mrs Black became a permanent teacher. From 2000 to 2004, she was teaching permanently at Maroondan State School and then during 2005 and 2006 at Wallaville State School. Mrs Black is now back to relief teaching. I am looking forward to a time when she might become a permanent teacher again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043705"></A>
This morning, I asked Mrs Black why she became a schoolteacher. She said that it was something that she had always wanted to do from the age of five. She came home from school and announced to her whole family that she was going to be a schoolteacher. It never changed from that moment on. That is an indication of the great quality of teaching that she had. She loves kids and helping them progress. I asked her who her favourite student was--apart from me--and she put me back in my place very quickly and said, ‘Teachers can’t have favourites.’ I remember her warm, giving, caring nature, her patience and her love. Today, which happens to be her golden wedding anniversary, on behalf of the people of the Burnett I thank her and wish her and her family the very best and another 54 years of teaching. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Hear, hear. Very well said, Minister. Now I will get into the tough stuff. We were educated in the old-fashioned way by a very strict head teacher, Mr McLachlan, who would give us the cuts if he thought it would improve our discipline and academic record. I know that many members opposite were probably educated in the same way. During my time at South Kolan Primary I can never remember seeing a fight or feeling as if I needed to fear for my safety in the schoolyard because we knew that if we stepped out of line we would get the cuts. There was the fear of God in us then. Sadly, that was not the case when I graduated to high school. Going from South Kolan Primary to high school was like going from a Utopia--although, yes, we did receive the cuts--to an island where sometimes it felt like we were in a scene out of <Hansard-Italic>
Lord of the Flies, </Hansard-Italic>
where bullying and intimidation was common--when compared with South Kolan Primary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043710"></A>
I believe that if we took care of the basics of education--safety and discipline--there would be an immediate increase in academic standards and a decrease in the incidence of student assaults and self-harm. I went to a graduation at the Burnett Youth Learning Centre in the Burnett, a wonderful learning institution doing a great job for children at risk of disengaging. I spoke with the mother of a young lad who, for the first time in his senior academic career, was excelling. This lad’s mum, herself a professional working in the medical system, was unequivocal as to the reason why he was doing so well: he was not being bullied and he was not being assaulted by other students between classes. They do not stand for that at the Burnett Youth Learning Centre. She went on to tell me that it was her professional opinion that assaults on children by other children were all too common and it was a sad fact that it is not well known or appreciated in the broader community, although events of late have brought that more to our common consciousness. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043711"></A>
No child should have to sit in a classroom wondering if they are going to get a flogging at big lunch, at the bus stop or on the way home. This is now the 21st century and after recent tragic events it is time to take the tough decisions to protect schoolchildren and teachers from illicit drugs and weapons. When Burnett-Bundaberg parents send their children to any school they have a legal and moral right to expect the school has taken every reasonable step to ensure that the school is illicit drug and weapons free. In light of the recent tragic death and violent offences in our school grounds throughout Queensland I think that a reasonable step to ensure that a school is illicit drug and weapons free is to give the P&amp;C, in cooperation with the principal, the option of choosing to introduce random searches by police and sniffer dogs for illicit drugs and weapons in schools. The police are already carrying out these searches on the streets and in nightclubs. Why should there be any difference inside the schoolyard? This would show bullies and thugs who want to intimidate students and even teachers with the threat of weapons that they will be caught and punished if they continue with their illegal behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043712"></A>
If the government does not provide this option to parents and schools then I believe there will come a day when the matter will end up before the civil courts and a judge will be asking the question: has the government taken all reasonable steps to ensure that students and teachers are kept safe while on school property? If the government refuses to give parents this option of random searches then obviously the answer will be no. </Hansard-Body>

 Thank you for your guidance.

I will leave that point at that. I thank the minister very much for his praise and the compliment that he paid Mrs Black. That will go down a treat back home in the Burnett.

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.35 pm): I rise to support the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill before us today which is aimed at improving the education of the children of this state. I rise in this debate because I feel the need to add some balance to some of the comments that I have heard from the opposition. We heard from the previous member that 20 years of Labor government has destroyed literacy and numeracy in this state. My career as an English teacher, and sometimes as a maths and history teacher as well, took place under National Party governments in the 1970s and 1980s. Things were no different in those days. In fact, I suspect that with regard to literacy and numeracy they were a lot worse than they are in schools today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043717"></A>
I taught at Calen Secondary College, Woodridge High School, Beenleigh High School and Browns Plains High School. There were students in grades 8, 9 and 10 who could not string a sentence together. They could not punctuate, did know what a verb was and had never read a book in their lives. They were excited when I read them <Hansard-Italic>
Charlotte’s Web</Hansard-Italic>
. This nonsense that there were glory days of education in Queensland prior to a Labor government is just that. I remember well one year teaching a group of grade 10s at Beenleigh High School. They were all lumped in the one class because they were the poorest performers at mathematics. I taught them long division that year. They had managed to get through 10 years of school without learning that. They could not multiply. By the end of the year they could multiply and they thought they were high achievers. That was in the 1980s. Things were no better then. In fact, what has changed over the last two decades is the new emphasis on education under a Labor government. There is more notice and attention given to standards and performance of our students than ever in the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043718"></A>
I do not believe that behaviour has improved or not improved. I can tell members stories from my time at Browns Plains High School such as when one lunch hour students stoned a koala in a tree and killed it. I can tell members stories from Woodridge High School that are truly horrifying such as a year 10 male student who was dragging girls into the boys’ toilets. This notion that students today are less literate and numerate than we were in our day is simply incorrect and fanciful rubbish. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043719"></A>
What I see from my own children and from my observations when I go into schools--and, let us face it, as members of parliament we do that on a regular basis--are students who are performing at very high and satisfactory levels. I look at my own children, and the quality and quantity of assignments that they have been asked to do in high school far exceeds anything I was asked to do as a student and far exceeds anything I asked my students to do when I was a teacher. As far as I can see, the standard and quality that students are producing in years 11 and 12 is much more similar to what I was producing during my university undergraduate degree than anything I was producing at school. Certainly the top half of our cohort today are producing a level of material that was unheard of for most of us. </Hansard-Body>

While we are right to examine the poor performance of students throughout their school years, I think we do not want to lose sight of the fact that education has improved so much from the days when there were 35-plus students in a room, which was the case when I was teaching, or when there were barely enough classrooms. I remember every year at Woodridge High School teachers would spend the first month wandering around the school with their class trying to find a room. By the time they actually found a room half the lesson was over and the bell rang and they all moved on and did the same thing again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046875"></A>
In those days schools did not have school halls. When Browns Plains State High School opened with 800 kids--the next year it had 1,600 kids--we barely had a book in the library. Contrast that to the kinds of schools that we are building these days and the kinds of resources that we are giving our children. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection from the member for Rockhampton, who also was a teacher in that era. He knows of the trials and tribulations that teachers faced in those days, yet we managed to produce some very good students and we tried to deliver a good quality education. Things have certainly changed, as they should and as they must. As we debate this particular topic, let us bring some common sense and intelligence to the debate. Let us not point the finger at one side of politics, because I am sure that each side of politics will try its best when it comes to educating our children. </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (3.41 pm): I am proud of the Bligh government’s approach to education and its drive to improve results among our students. Specialised coaches and additional teachers in the areas of literacy, numeracy and science are a key step in ensuring our kids get a flying start in life. Next week, the community cabinet comes to Far North Queensland and, as part of the visit, I will have great pleasure in joining the Premier and education minister to officially open Innisfail State College. The new educational precinct is a $36.7 million investment in the local community. It will be the most modern education facility outside of Brisbane and will do amazing things to enhance employment and training opportunities for students. This is a learning opportunity that does not exist anywhere else in the state. It is just one of a range of education reforms that we are undertaking and it demonstrates this government’s commitment to providing our students with the support they need to achieve success at school and beyond. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043767"></A>
Early childhood education and care is a priority for the Bligh government to help our youngest Queenslanders fulfil their potential. The Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010 incorporates three important amendments for the provision of high-quality early childhood services in Queensland. Firstly, it will ensure that child-care services are required to maintain a logbook of their compliance history. This logbook will assist parents in obtaining valuable information about licensed early childhood education and care centres that have previously failed to comply with the Child Care Act 2002. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043770"></A>
Secondly, the bill will further amend the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act to enable the college to develop and administer preregistration testing of aspiring teachers. As we are all aware, the implementation of this testing was a recommendation of the Masters review. This is another example of the Bligh government coming through with an election commitment to improve school performance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043772"></A>
Thirdly, the bill will amend the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005 to enable the recognition of certain teaching experiences for the purpose of renewing teacher registration. This is a step in the right direction in recognising the invaluable contribution made by teachers working in non-school environments like kindergartens.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043773"></A>
I welcome the announcement in December last year that this year Mulgrave would benefit from new kindergarten services as part of the Bligh government’s pilot program. The ABC Learning Centre at Tamarind Gardens will be among the first group of long-day-care centres to be subsidised to offer kindergarten programs taught by qualified teachers as part of the government’s commitment to universal access. Having a kindergarten program combined with the convenience of long day care will be great for working parents who want their children to access quality early education. The Tamarind Gardens ABC Learning Centre is located in the fast-growing southern corridor of Cairns and I know the extra services will be welcomed by parents in our area. I also know that, as population growth will continue strongly, growth will fuel demand for early childhood education and child-care services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043775"></A>
As a father, the implementation of a logbook system for child-care centres is an initiative that is of particular importance to me. My wife and I can count ourselves among the vast number of families across Far North Queensland and the rest of Queensland that have two parents who work. This arrangement is common, as more families than ever are entrusting their pre-prep-age children to day-care centres and kindergartens during the working week. This year my son, Tristan, started day care in Gordonvale. Last week he picked up his first day-care cold and, as other parents would know, this meant that his mum also had her first day-care cold. He also received his first ‘love bite’ from another child. Each morning when I drop him at the centre, like other parents I expect that Tristan will be safe and will receive high-quality care. I am very fortunate that the centre he attends has wonderful staff who clearly have a genuine interest in the welfare of my son.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043776"></A>
The amendments in this bill provide for the introduction of logbooks in child-care centres. This means that, as a parent, I will have the ability to visit Tristan’s centre and be made aware of any issues of noncompliance that the centre may have experienced. This measure offers peace of mind and ensures an open and honest relationship between service providers and parents. It also means that the community will be able to access information about whether a child-care centre is complying with minimum legislated standards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043777"></A>
There are many dedicated child-care workers at many good and reputable child-care centres in the electorate of Mulgrave that I represent. The owners and managers of those centres understand that the logbooks will be beneficial to their child-care centre. Because they do provide a high-quality service, their logbook will contain minimal entries of noncompliance. In this regard, the logbook serves as an incentive to maintain a high-quality service, because members of the community will be able to access information about any breaches. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043778"></A>
As a parent, I know that this information will be invaluable when making a decision about which child-care provider to use. Ensuring that the centre that cares for a child is providing a high-quality service that meets legislated standards would play a significant role in any parent’s decision making, including mine. It is also anticipated that the logbook system will provide greater accountability in the child-care industry and will, therefore, encourage the sector to continually strive to improve. Knowing that the community will have access to the logbooks of each and every child-care provider in an area and that parents may chose between providers based on that information will motivate service providers to ensure they are consistently compliant with legislated standards. The Bligh government makes no apology for this. This improvement will increase the level of confidence that those accessing child-care centres have in those services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043779"></A>
The two groups within the child-care industry that will be required to keep a logbook are licensed centre based services, such as kindergartens, and family day care services. Once information has been listed in the logbook, it is required to stay in the book for as long as the licensee holds a licence for that service. It is important to note that the department will work alongside the child-care sector to ensure that minimum standards are being met without compliance notices necessarily having to be issued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043780"></A>
The introduction of logbooks will be advantageous to both sides of the relationship--between child-care centres and those accessing their services. For parents and the local community it provides easily accessible and accurate information about the performance of a particular centre in relation to its compliance with legislation. This creates greater confidence and comparability for parents and guardians around the service they are accessing. In addition, the need to provide this information to the community is expected to drive improvements in the child-care sector. This level of accountability to the community will ensure that service providers consistently strive to provide a high-quality service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043781"></A>
As I said earlier, I am proud of this government’s approach to early education and child care. We are driving reforms to meet the high expectations that parents quite rightly have. They want their children to receive the best education in Australia in a safe and secure environment. That is what we intend to deliver. It is my view that the amendments in this bill will be of great benefit to both the people of Queensland and the child-care sector generally. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043783"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (3.47 pm): I rise to support the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010 and I congratulate the Minister for Education on bringing this bill before the House. This bill highlights the benefits that have come from changes within the department of education, which now oversees early childhood services, the schooling system and the vocational education system. That means that we can deliver on development, job opportunities and training for the people of Queensland, regardless of age and regardless of where they sit in the education system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043784"></A>
The child-care reforms contained in this bill are part of a two-stage reform to the Child Care Act 2002 to ensure Queensland parents are getting the best possible care and the best possible information about the care being provided to their children. The first stage was the publication on the department website of repeated moderate and serious non-compliant services. This publication commenced on 1 February, 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043786"></A>
This bill comprises a second stage and requires licensees of child-care centres other than school-age-care services to display on their premises a compliance history logbook. This logbook will show the moderate and serious non-compliance issues in stage 1, as well as minor non-compliance issues. However, we need to be clear: this is only for formal non-compliance matters raised by the department and not smaller matters that are quickly rectified through the departmental investigation process. The sort of non-compliance matters we are talking about are issues where child-care centres are found not to have adequate staffing in place but do not include things like a notice to say that a tree root needs grinding to make sure it is not a trip hazard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043821"></A>
This change gives parents the information they need to make a decision about the care of their children--and what an important decision that is. Child-care centres are placed in a significant position of trust within our community. For a great part of the day these child-care operators are in the position of parents, having that role to supervise, care and nurture the development of young children. The reforms contained in this bill also ensure that the public can have confidence in the care being provided by our child-care industry. When constituents have raised concerns with me about child-care centres, I know that what hurts them most is often the not knowing. It is about when their child is injured and they are not told. Parents want to know what has happened to their child, what standards are being enforced at the child-care centre and what they can do about it. This logbook system gives parents that information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043826"></A>
I am delighted to see that the LNP will be supporting this bill, but I am concerned that we have a trend here that those opposite will support a bill but go through some insipid hand wringing trying to appease those people who have concerns about it. If they were to bring forward alternatives or amendments, we should debate them rather than have them saying, ‘I will support it, but I just want to put all my concerns on the record.’ This is the first time that the member for Burnett’s contribution has been quite a reasonable one, and I thank him for that. Many times I have got up after the member for Burnett and had to criticise most of what he said, but that is not the case on this occasion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043829"></A>
The other change is the introduction of preregistration of testing of teachers. This implements an important recommendation of the Masters review. Under this change, aspiring teachers are required to display a threshold level of knowledge about the teaching of literacy, numeracy and science. These are the building block subjects for our children, not only allowing them to develop further learning within the school environment but allowing them to search out further knowledge outside of school. The purpose of these amendments is not to exclude aspiring teachers but to ensure that parents and the public have confidence in the literacy and numeracy skills of teachers. I hope that not one person, after having already undertaken 12 years of schooling or maybe more and three or more years of tertiary study, fails this exam. But what we must do is ensure that our universities are changing the way they deliver their courses in teaching to ensure that by the time people graduate with a bachelor of education these young people are ready to become teachers of the future and the community’s expectations of the standards of teachers are being met. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043830"></A>
In terms of education standards, this government has delivered such a great improvement over the last 10 years. We have seen the introduction of prep. We have seen the current rollout of 240 kindergartens--the year before prep. We have also seen the important ETRF reforms earlier this decade which introduced some great flexibility into our schools. When I graduated from high school I never thought I would go to a high school graduation and see a trainee of the year and an apprentice of the year. Our high schools with their ‘earning or learning’ requirement are now providing young people real vocational opportunities in a school setting that were never available in the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043832"></A>
There has been constant reform of the education sector. This is an important next step, but this government will continue to ensure that Queensland’s education is of the highest standard possible. I congratulate the minister and commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (3.52 pm): I rise to speak on the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill. Last week I very fortunate to attend the Helping Families Change Conference at the University of Queensland. That conference was organised by Professor Matt Sanders, who has become very well known to the community as a founder of the Triple P--Positive Parenting Program. It was a wonderful conference, with a lot of enthusiastic educators and specialists in child care and in parenting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043840"></A>
I was very fortunate, along with my wife Robyn, to be part of the pilot study for the Triple P program for teenagers. Whether it made me a better parent, I hope so. All members here who are parents realise the real challenges of being a parent and raising children. They also realise the significance and the role of parents in ensuring the education of their child. It is not just about child care. It is not just about schools or kindies that have a responsibility for education. It is a partnership often between parents and teachers, child-care workers and kindergarten teachers. So I was fortunate to be at that conference last week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043842"></A>
This bill deals with the issue of child-care services. In the last couple of weeks it has been a real pleasure to be able to attend a number of AGMs at community kindergartens in my electorate--again, seeing enthusiastic parents who are very keen to get the best outcomes for their children. This bill includes a requirement for licensees of child-care services, other than school-age care services, to keep compliance history logbooks. I can understand the need for that requirement, and I will be supporting that today. I recognise that it may create a greater administrative burden on some licensees, but it is important that parents are fully aware of what is occurring at child care and at kindy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043843"></A>
As I said, I attended a number of AGMs at community kindergartens. This issue was not raised at those meetings. A number of other issues were raised though including the issue of funding for those children attending kindergartens who are under 3 years. As many members would be aware, we have seen a change in the funding program and that will come into place at the beginning of next year. Historically, the state government has provided subsidies for children between three and 3 years, even though that was below the target age group for that funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043844"></A>
A number of the parents came up to me during those AGMs and said, ‘My first child was here as a three-year-old and did get funding but now my younger child coming through will not be getting funding. What am I going to do?’ The alternatives for them are not great. They can raise money through their kindergarten committee, but many committees are already overburdened in terms of funding. Kindies are also looking at increasing the fees for those children. Another alternative of course is to take those children out of community kindergartens and put them into child care. This is a real challenge, because for some of those community kindergartens this could mean the end of those community kindergartens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043845"></A>
I have spoken to some of the kindergarten teachers at those facilities and some of the parents and they worry about the future of their community kindergarten. The parents do not want to necessarily put their child into child care but the reality is that they would get a much better subsidy by having their child in child care rather than in a community kindergarten. Also, many of the parents are not aware of this change. It is only slowly filtering through as we go through this process of AGMs at kindies. So, while the government is making some useful changes here, I ask the minister to ensure that he looks at this issue of funding for three- to 3-year-olds and the effect it will have. I am sure that he is not intending for this change in the funding to have that effect but it will have that effect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043846"></A>
I note that this bill will implement a system for testing of persons in literacy, numeracy or science prior to registering them as teachers and to recognise certain teaching experience for the purposes of teacher registration. I note that the minister’s second reading speech refers to the Geoff Masters review of literacy, numeracy and science in Queensland primary schools and his report <Hansard-Italic>
A shared challenge: improving literacy, numeracy and science learning in Queensland primary schools</Hansard-Italic>
. Geoff Masters concluded in his review that improved outcomes in literacy, numeracy and science are likely to be facilitated by a number of factors and they include access to a well-prepared teaching workforce, as the minister quite rightly says. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043852"></A>
What the minister did not mention is that the Masters report also said that one of the most important things was direct funding of schools. Geoff Masters said that individual schools are best placed to determine the details of the resources and support they require. Appropriate funding for our state primary schools must be a priority, which is why I am concerned that as much as $100 per student in direct funding to those schools has been stripped away by the Bligh government. Earlier this month I attended a function with the Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations, and I acknowledge that the minister attended as well. During that function a number of those attending came up to me to speak about this anomaly in the funding and the fact that the funding has not gone to the schools directly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047095"></A>
The P&amp;Cs are also being increasingly called on, as you, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be aware, to raise funds to make up shortfalls--a task made even more difficult in the face of tough economic times. It is significant that in late 2008 the federal minister for education put this funding over and asked for it to go directly to these primary schools but, unfortunately, as many of the people at that P&amp;C association meeting said to me, the money did not go directly to the schools. So while today we have heard from our opponents on the other side of the House about how wonderfully they have been doing in education, sadly they have not been providing the money for the schools that they were supposed to. This was direct funding, discretionary funding, that was supposed to go straight to these schools. The federal government put that money aside and it went to the Queensland government, but the Queensland government kept it aside.</Hansard-Body>

Mr Hoolihan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 What does this have to do with the bill?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047099"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This is about education. We have heard repeatedly from members on the other side of the House about how well they are doing in education. We have heard about the history of the professions of the people in the House. But, sadly, when it comes to real, practical purposes for the money--the money that those principals wanted--it has not happened. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047100"></A>
While I support this bill today, there are two crucial areas: funding for three- and 3-year-olds at kindies and that anomaly in funding--the money that should have been going to those schools. That is the true sense of what this government is about in education. The lack of funding in those two areas shows that the government is falling short. As I said, I support this bill but I raise those two issues with the minister. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (4.01 pm): I rise to speak to the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill 2010. I have to say that the other act that is being amended is very important and should be taken note of, particularly by the community. This bill came about in part as a result of the Masters report, as has been stated by previous speakers, and it has two elements. The first one is the logbook provisions. Whilst I recognise that keeping paperwork and storing information is an impost on those people who operate any facility, it is very important, as other speakers have said, that parents have confidence in the facility that they entrust their children to.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047105"></A>
In my electorate we have excellent kindergartens and early learning centres. Very rarely, if ever, have I heard of problems in terms of their compliance. Indeed, one early childhood centre in the electorate ran into difficulties--and this was not under the current minister--because they went beyond the requirements in terms of their provision of space and toileting facilities et cetera and had a small space in their early childhood centre that was not used properly because they went, as I said, over the specification.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047106"></A>
Once parents become familiar with the logbook, they will use it as a tool to decide where their children will attend. I certainly would use it if I had little ones. It is an easy tool to check compliance with the regulations. If centres comply with the regulations, it reflects the attitude of those who are running the facility and its resources. Whilst I recognise that there will be some impost, I think it will be a great tool for those early childhood centres and kindies that are doing the right thing and complying because they will have a way to positively reinforce their hard work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047107"></A>
The second element is the literacy, numeracy and science testing of students who have graduated but have not yet registered as teachers. I think all parents will welcome this but, in a way, it is regrettable that we have to do this. As other speakers have said, these are young adults who have completed maybe 16 years of education and at the end of that time they are having to prove that they have an adequate understanding of numeracy, literacy and science to be able to go into the teaching workforce. It used to be that that was a given. History has shown, though, that this additional testing has to be done to ensure that those who should be going into the teaching profession do so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047108"></A>
The member for Sunnybank commented on her teaching experience in the eighties and I know that several of the schools she listed were in particularly challenging areas. I am sure that, as a teacher in those areas, the member for Sunnybank saw some very sad and confronting incidents. The member also said in her contribution that some of the children there had never read a book, and I am sure that is 100 per cent true. We have noticed that the children who are not exposed to literature early in their lives--that is, their parents do not read to them of a night before they go to bed or do not read at some opportunity through the week on a regular basis--have diminished cognitive and literacy skills. I commend the Premier’s announcement in relation to reading in schools. I hope we can achieve the number of volunteers who are required to complete that job, particularly with the obligations for volunteers to be able to access the school. Those obligations are excellent but they have, in some ways, put people off volunteering. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047109"></A>
To a great extent, the member for Sunnybank correctly compared then and now. We still do have children who have learning challenges. We have a curriculum that is extensive. We have parents who are regularly going to school and saying things like, ‘My child may be struggling with literacy. Can they drop off the LOTE program?’ because we offer such an extensive curriculum. We have wonderful teachers in the teaching system. As part of our role as legislators and decision makers, we need to ensure that they are properly recompensed, that they have opportunities for professional development, that their class sizes are appropriate to the mix of students they are required and asked to teach, and that they have appropriate resources for the task before them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047110"></A>
Many teachers whom you talk to love their vocation. They are very respectful of the children and desirous of those children reaching their full potential. Fundamental to them being able to achieve those goals is that they themselves have the skills. As I said, in some ways I think it is a bit sad that we have got to this point where people who have completed 16 years of schooling have to be tested to ensure their competency, but in the long run it will have benefits for the students.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047111"></A>
I want to again put on the record my appreciation of all of the teachers in the electorate of Gladstone. I have met many of them. They are wonderful people. They are dedicated to our young people and their futures. I commend them for their dedication and application. I support the bill. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (4.07 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Child Care and Another Act Amendment Bill, and I also will be brief. I support the bill and the intention of the minister in what he is trying to achieve under this proposed change to Queensland law. But if we are going to require that primary school teachers be tested before they are registered and after they have been through a very extensive training program, let us see some consistency with other departments. I flag Queensland Health as an example. Let us see come consistency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047115"></A>
Some time ago a constituent came to see me complaining that a doctor at one of our hospitals could not be understood. I am relating this example to the bill we have before the House--that teachers need to have certain literacy skills, numeracy skills and science skills. I was stunned that we actually had an employed doctor in Queensland who could not speak English. The nurses could not understand him and the patients could not understand him. He got through the system. I give that as an example to say that, yes, we need to have this sort of testing to ensure that our professionals--be they teachers, nurses or doctors--have basic skills that we all take for granted and expect as the norm. After I raised that matter with a former minister for health I was assured that it would not happen again. Lo and behold, it did. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047117"></A>
So I use this opportunity to ask the Minister for Education to please take the matter up with his colleague the Minister for Health to ensure that all of our overseas trained doctors, our agency nurses and our staff in our health system have the skills that we all expect and demand--just like we are proposing here in relation to our primary school teachers. It is just as important that our teachers have these skills as it is that foreign trained doctors who come into our Queensland Health hospitals have these skills.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1047159"></A>
The bill also recognises the teaching experiences of those dedicated people who take on educational leadership roles but who are not necessarily directly involved in delivering educational programs to students in the classroom.

I want to give the House an example of where an acting principal who was appointed by the department became the full-time principal. This principal spent most of their time in the department, and can I say what an embarrassment it was. The school fell apart. We had that many complaints. I have never had so many complaints in relation to a principal as I did at this school. It led to an investigation and eventually the principal moved on. We now have that school firing on all cylinders. It has a great principal, a great deputy, a great P&amp;C, and the school community is united and working as one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047161"></A>
I raise that issue because I am concerned when I read this bill and listen to contributions from members about the involvement of the department of education in the policing and management of these notebooks and perhaps compliance issues. I am also aware of a matter involving a teacher who was stood down for over 12 months while the department investigated complaints. It concerns me that sometimes our departmental officers do not have their feet firmly on the ground. They need a reality check when they believe everything a student says, they believe everything a parent says and they give no credit to our teachers. They investigate a teacher who has been working in the schooling system for years and years, and these middle-management bureaucrats seem to think they have all the answers. I say to those middle-management bureaucrats, ‘Perhaps you need to spend some time in the classroom.’ Perhaps we should have a requirement that they need to demonstrate they have their feet firmly on the ground by spending time in the classroom and not automatically acknowledging and giving them credit for all the time they have spent in the department. I raise that matter now because sometimes we need a reality check. I think it is the Ethical Standards Unit of the department of education. That is a very important unit, but sometimes we need a reality check. We need to review the operation of these departments. </Hansard-Body>

I will return to the bill before the House. I note that this bill is acknowledging teaching experiences and duties which people have performed while working as educational advisers in roles other than directly in the school. With that short contribution, I resume my seat. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (4.12 pm), in reply: I thank the Deputy Speaker for the opportunity to speak in reply on this debate. I thank all members for the contributions they have made. I will make some general observations and respond directly to some of the comments that have been made.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047170"></A>
Firstly, I will take up some of the issues raised by the honourable shadow minister. In relation to logbooks and information about what constitutes noncompliance with the Child Care Act in outdoor settings, I am advised that this would include inadequate soft fall; poorly maintained, insufficient, dangerous or broken equipment; poorly maintained or unhygienic sandpits--for example, uneven ground causing tripping hazards--and things like that. I think that well illustrates that point.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047173"></A>
In relation to concern about red tape, I draw the shadow minister’s attention to the observation of the member for Broadwater, who I think made a great observation. We have to get the balance right, and we believe we have struck the right balance. There is no more red tape if services are compliant and remain compliant. At this point I want to make the important point that we have a very highly responsive and responsible child-care industry in Queensland. The Office for Early Childhood Education and Care works extremely well with all of the stakeholders and across the industry. I want to commend the industry and the stakeholders for the cooperative and highly responsible approach that they take in not only protecting the safety and wellbeing of young children who are in their services now but also protecting and building upon the high reputation that our sector has in Queensland in the long term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047175"></A>
That is why over the years there has developed a highly cooperative relationship with the department between the Office for Early Childhood Education and Care and the sector such that there are many regular visits by officers of the early childhood care section of the department. Extensive conversations occur between those officers and particular child-care centres to ensure that they are receiving proper guidance about compliance with the relevant regulations. On occasions, correspondence is entered into between the officers and the centres to help guide better compliance with the legislation. In effect, as a last resort only compliance notices are issued where all other efforts on a cooperative basis from the department have not produced a satisfactory level of compliance with the legislation. Then one moves into the compliance notice phase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047176"></A>
That is a very small percentage of occasions and illustrates well that the vast majority of operators are doing the right thing. I recognise that and so does the department. It is a highly regarded and respected industry. That level of public high reputation is able to be maintained because there is such vigilance by officers and a cooperative effort undertaken to ensure that, where there may be a failure to observe proper regulation, there is proper discussion and understanding about how that can be achieved. It is only in a very small number of cases where compliance notices are issued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047177"></A>
As the member has indicated, there is the issue of getting the balance right between the parents’ right to know and the legitimate business interests of the operator. That is a position that I subscribe to. We believe we have struck the right balance. The pre-eminent concern ultimately has to be with the safety and wellbeing of young children and to the entitlement of parents to be well informed about whether or not that paramount obligation is being discharged by the early childhood education service that they are proposing to use or by the service that they are using.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047178"></A>
Consultation was raised as an issue by the shadow minister. I am advised that there was very extensive consultation on the proposals in this bill as part of the consultation on measures introduced in previous legislation. That was stage 1. This is now stage 2. I was personally involved in some discussions with representatives of the various stakeholders to underline the importance of these initiatives and also the regard in which the industry is held and the representative organisations that speak for the sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047179"></A>
A question was raised about compliance, and the review and the department’s actions to oversight and reflect upon whether or not the compliance mechanisms in the department are robust enough. That is underway. That has involved consultation with the industry sector. We want to ensure that there is consistency in the standard applied by the various officers in interacting with the child-care service providers; that those standards are high; that there is appropriate training for those officers; and that there is good communication between officers and child-care service providers to ensure the maximum quality outcome from compliance with the appropriate legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050304"></A>
Another issue is the demand for and supply of teachers in Queensland. Historically there has been a significant oversupply of teachers, particularly in the primary school setting. The graduates come out of various universities--I think about seven universities have education faculties. Universities are funded and essentially regulated, in terms of the degree courses they offer, at a federal level. It is based on a competitive model. The universities are doing their level best to provide the best teacher education they can for Queenslanders and others coming to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050305"></A>
The department has had very open conversations with the deans of education of the various universities over recent years and drawn their attention to the fact that there are far more teacher graduates coming through their education faculties than there are vacancies within the state system or, indeed, the Catholic and independent system. I am sure that is an issue the universities are considering carefully in terms of the allocation of resources they make within their universities. We will continue to urge them to carefully consider the implications of a significant oversupply of teachers from year to year and trust that that supply/demand imbalance can be addressed in due course. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050306"></A>
I want to underline that there are many, many more people applying to teach in the Queensland state education sector than there are vacancies. There is no shortage of teachers to fill vacancies. There are particular teaching areas like science, maths and manual arts where there are shortages and some locations throughout the state where there are difficulties filling vacancies, but there is no shortage in terms of overall interest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050307"></A>
I turn to the issue of teacher preregistration testing. We are in the early phase in this regard. The cost of administering these tests when finalised is an implementation issue. This legislation will enable the college to get on with the work of developing and trialling these tests at this stage and then ultimately putting them into place. That will involve developing the test, putting in place the arrangements for people to sit the tests and writing support materials to assist applicants. Obviously, the cost of developing these tests is a very important consideration. The government has undertaken to fund the estimated $3.2 million cost involved in developing and trialling the tests in preparation for their launch in 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050309"></A>
We will work closely with the Queensland College of Teachers to finalise the longer term costs of delivering the tests. We will do that this year. That will involve consultation through the standard regulatory assessment process. That is consistent with normal practice. We will make sure that we consult with all stakeholders who have a legitimate interest in that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050310"></A>
I will make a couple of observations. I notice that the opposition spokesperson did address, in a fairly straightforward manner, the LNP’s response to this legislation. Regrettably, I observed--and I think other members on the government side might also have observed--that his view was not matched by LNP members individually. Despite protestations to the contrary, I suspect, they really spoke against the bill. They found various reasons for speaking against the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050311"></A>
It will be interesting to see whether they vote for the bill, given that their sentiments--if not entirely in words but in spirit--clearly attacked the bill in some respect or other. That does not seem to be consistent with the formal position as announced by the LNP spokesperson that the LNP will be supporting the bill. I look forward with great interest to see whether those members vote against the bill so that their conduct is consistent with the message that they have sent loud and clear in this chamber today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050312"></A>
I recognise the contributions made by all government members. They have identified that the initiatives in this bill are part of a significant reform of the education system in Queensland. I want to expressly acknowledge the contribution of the Leader of the House and the member for Rockhampton. They belled the cat in terms of the nonsensical illusion that members opposite are wanting us to imbibe that there was some golden era of education under the Bjelke-Petersen government. I do not need to elaborate how factually baseless is such an assertion because the Leader of the House and the member for Rockhampton belled the cat in that regard and knocked that assertion over. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050313"></A>
Let us come to the current day. Nine out of 10, or 90 per cent, of Queensland students are achieving at the national level or above. Those on the other side seem to forget that. Yes, there are opportunities to improve--as every state, including Queensland, is doing. Queensland improved in 17 out of 20 NAPLAN test areas between 2008 and 2009. We are improving faster than New South Wales and Victoria. One needs to look at 100 per cent of the cohort and not just the 10 per cent that may not have achieved the 90 per cent national standard or above--and we recognise they need to improve--to have an across-the-board and fair-minded view about where Queensland’s education system sits relative to the other states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050315"></A>
If we go back to the Bjelke-Petersen era, we will not find a budget in which 25 per cent of the budget was directed to education. Some 25 per cent of this budget--some $9.3 billion--goes to education. That is unprecedented. The Bjelke-Petersen government never did that. In those years we never had top-level pay for teachers like we now have after the $1.130 billion wage agreement reached with teachers at the end of last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050316"></A>
We in Queensland have equal to the best class sizes when compared to the other states, especially in the middle school years. If we were back in the Bjelke-Petersen era we would have been dragging the chain. Some $10 million a day is spent in capital to build new schools. That was not happening in the Bjelke-Petersen days. Inclusive education for children with special needs and disabilities did not happen then. The funding that is given to them now was not given to them then. I will just rule a line underneath this illusion that is being promoted by the other side about the golden era of education under Bjelke-Petersen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050317"></A>
I will address a couple of other points. One was made by the member for Indooroopilly, Mr Emerson, and related to the funding for C&amp;Ks--that is, if I have heard the issue right, as he has raised it. The DECKAS funding program which operates this year and has operated for many years provides funding for 80 per cent of the salaries of C&amp;K staff. It goes to the service; it does not go to the parents. To correct the impression that people might have, innocently acquired, of how this funding operates, I will outline how it operates. Some 80 per cent of the staff costs for C&amp;Ks go to the service. They do not actually go to the parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053357"></A>
Under the DECKAS policy, if a kindy-age child--that is, 3 to 4--does not require a place, then a younger child--that is, a three-year-old--could take up that place. The focus of the new model is on ensuring that every kindy-age child between 3 and 4 accesses the kindy. The funding targets are designed to ensure that the funds go into that year age span that is immediately preceding the prep year--that is, 4 to 5. So we are looking at kids aged 3 to 4 for the kindy program which underpins the prep program, which is for kids aged 4 to 5.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053360"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I said, the DECKAS never was formally allocating funds for kids aged three years to 4. The DECKAS funding was for kids aged 3 to 4. In the event that there was a vacancy in that cohort group, I am advised that the DECKAS funding program permitted a three- to 3-year-old child to be in that session group. The DECKAS funding was never for the breadth of kids aged three to 4; it was always kids aged 3 to 4. I am getting all of those visual indications from my advisers that that has been accurately conveyed to the member opposite on the advice that they have given me. There was one other issue that I will respond to later at an appropriate time so that I am sure that the record is clear. I do not want to mislead the shadow spokesperson or the member for Indooroopilly on the second issue that he raised, and I will address that at a later point during the debate on the clauses of this bill if the opportunity is available to me so that we can be clear on that. I commend the bill to the House.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.32 pm): As the minister knows, we are supporting this measure, but some of the feedback is about the level of red tape and the amount of time that child-care centre staff have to spend on administrative procedures. Is it feasible that when a notice of some sort is issued to a child-care centre the detail that is required under this act to be included in the logbook could be printed off and sent to the child-care centre along with the notice so that that form that the government has printed off could be included in the logbook? It would firstly assuage some of the concern about red tape affecting the centre, but I suspect it might make the logbooks more accurate as well and get around the problem perhaps of illegible writing or a genuine misunderstanding on the part of some centres as to what information is required. It does seem to me that, given that the information will be contained in the notice anyway, it is probably not a difficult thing for the government to be able to do and it might make the system work better.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053379"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I indicated earlier in my address-in-reply, the departmental officers work closely with child-care services where they have any concern of a potential noncompliance with the relevant regulations through close conversations and site visits and discussions about what changed behaviour or practice or other things need to be fixed. At a later stage there may be correspondence that is gone through to try to get greater clarity about what requirements need to be met. So the issue of the notice of compliance is actually in fact--not literally--a step of last resort. I would expect the departmental officers to be working closely with the industry after the legislation passes this House. They will work closely with the industry to ensure that the administrative arrangements involved in implementing this initiative are done in such a streamlined way that it maximises achieving the purpose of this legislation with the least impact in terms of bureaucratic processes and exchange of paperwork and that sort of thing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053382"></A>
The departmental officers will talk to the sector about how they can minimise costs in terms of sending and returning correspondence. Indeed, there may perhaps be a standard template of information made available for registering on the logbook. The legislation is very clear about the matters that do have to be registered on the logbook. In terms of whether it is administratively appropriate for a form reflecting the legislation to go out at the same time as a notice of compliance, I will leave that to the department. It is an operational matter, but I am confident that those officers will speak closely with the sector to ensure that there is only the minimum necessary administrative processes to implement a very good initiative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053384"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Minister. I am pleased that that suggestion, which came from one of the child-care centres, might at least get some consideration. Minister, with the information required to be recorded in the logbooks for the child-care centres under the previous arrangement--which would still be in effect of course--where centres that breach the regulations have to be published on the website, that only dealt with moderate and severe infringements whereas the requirement to record in the logbook also applies to minor infringements, some of which are really quite minor. For example, the real-life case that was raised with me was that there was a problem with the font size of the printing on the staff member’s photo. Why has it been necessary to include such minor issues in the logbook when it was not considered necessary for the website?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053391"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The starting point from a policy point of view before the legislation was put to the House setting up the website as the vehicle for publication involved a consideration of whether or not all compliance notices should be published on the web. I believe that, quite rightly after consultation with the sector, a decision was reached that compliance notices in relation to minor matters should be excluded and that they should not be required to be published on the web, which goes to all and sundry of course, but to simply put repeated moderate offences and serious offences on the web. When it comes to a physical logbook in the centre, the view has been taken--and I think, on balance, the right view--that it is appropriate to have notices of noncompliance in relation to minor matters entered on the physical document that is only accessible at the centre and by those who are already using the centre or potentially going to use the centre because they are checking out the centre.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056504"></A>
It was quite appropriate to do that because the parents at the centre are in a position there and then to take up with the centre manager some explanation for what that problem was. Whereas it would be quite unfair, I think, if that type of relatively low-level noncompliance was published to the world and the centre owner and manager had no practical opportunity to converse over matters that could be clarified and explained quite simply at the centre. So because the logbook is more of a traditional device accessible only by those using the centre where there is already an existing relationship between the parent and the centre owner or manager and daily conversations are able to be had about how the centre is running and any concerns that parents might have, I think on balance it is appropriate that those matters be able to be entered on the physical logbook only and then parents are in a position to have conversations with the owner or the manager. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056505"></A>
It should be borne in mind that if the noncompliance is of a relatively minor nature--leaving aside what I trust is an anomalous example that the member gave earlier--it begs the question as to how the centre’s failure to address that issue could reach such a point. After all the efforts that officers go to to try to bring about compliance, a notice to comply is issued in relation to a minor matter. One would expect the centre, if it is a minor matter, to address it well before they get to a situation that a notice of compliance is issued. I will ask for some advice from my department about what I suspect is an entirely anomalous illustration that the member has given earlier--innocently I expect, of course. One would think that that is not a matter that--</Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, I am sure it was, but I would like to think confidently that it was an anomalous outcome that in any event would be addressed by the review that we are doing of compliance--as to how the officers are working in the compliance area and interacting with the industry to ensure that they have the appropriate training and there are consistent levels of high-quality treatment of all of the centres to ensure that if incidents such as the member has reported have taken place then they are eliminated as far as human effort can do so. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.42 pm): I seek clarification from the minister in relation to clause 7 which stipulates which graduate teachers applying for registration would be required to undergo tests, which would be prescribed by regulation. Therefore, those tests are not in this bill that is being considered by the parliament. Could the minister clarify which graduates applying for registration would be required to undertake the English, maths and science tests and also confirm whether, as I have been led to believe, it would apply to teachers qualified in the primary area and the early childhood area and not to those in the secondary area--or whether, in fact, it is going to apply to all graduates? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056512"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The short answer to the member’s question is that the preregistration testing at this juncture is going to apply to those teachers who are seeking registration for the purposes of going into the primary school setting. We have already foreshadowed in the formal response to the Masters report that we would consider at a later point the issue of preregistration testing in relation to teachers who propose to go into the secondary school setting. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056519"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.45 pm): I have a number of concerns in relation to this clause which the minister might like to clarify for me. If the minister has a pen, I might just set out all of my concerns to him up-front. It might be easier for him that way. Clause 10(25A) states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1056522"></A>
Literacy, numeracy or science test may be prescribed </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1056523"></A>
‘A regulation prescribing a test for literacy, numeracy or science. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056524"></A>
The issue was raised with me as to whether that would mean that some applicants would not be required to undertake all of those tests but possibly only literacy, only numeracy or only science because the word ‘and’ is not there, the word ‘or’ only is there. I am particularly concerned about subclause (e), which refers to the fees payable for undertaking the test. One of the issues that I raised in my contribution to the second reading debate, which I do not think the minister responded to in his summing-up, is that the government is not making a financial contribution to the Queensland College of Teachers for the acquisition of these tests or the application, or the marking, or all the other things that go along with testing. Somebody is going to have to pay. I do not think that the Queensland College of Teachers’ budget is all that flush with cash. I could be wrong. So it seems to me that the approach is going to be user pays. It also occurs to me that these tests could be quite expensive. Could the minister give me some guidance as to who is going to pay? Is full cost recovery going to be taken against those applying? Could the minister give me some guidance as to what he thinks the fees would be for graduate students taking this test? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056527"></A>
We would all agree that it would be fairly irksome to be hit with a substantial fee in an environment where, as the minister said in his summing-up, we have a glut of primary school teachers. I think the minister was very clear that the seven education faculties around the state had overproduced primary school teachers, which has resulted in a glut. So many of the people graduating and applying for registration will be hoping for a job and, in fact, many will not get a job--certainly not in the state system and perhaps not in a school at all. The issue of the fees to undertake these tests in that environment becomes an even more important issue. So I would be very keen for the minister to clarify the issue of the fees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056528"></A>
There was also an issue when these tests were first mooted--and I know the Premier made some comments in relation to somebody who fails one or other or all of the tests--whether these people will simply keep resitting them until they pass or whether they would be required to go back and do some further study or whether a period of time would have to elapse before they could sit the tests again. There is also the issue of what the fee would be for a resit--for example, if somebody failed one of the three components and had to resit that component. As well, there is the issue about how long it would be before they could resit the test. There is an issue around what the fee would be to resit. Regulation would prescribe how long it is before somebody’s application lapsed if they did fail. These are important issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056558"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Turning to the member’s first issue relating to clause 10, the proposed section 25A ‘(Literacy, numeracy or science test may be prescribed)’, the advice to me is that parliamentary counsel advised it ought to be drafted that way. From a statutory interpretation and drafting point of view the expression ‘or’ includes an interpretation ‘and/or’. ‘And’ does not include ‘or’ so it does not give you the flexibility of how the test might be constructed. The test may not include matters to do with science because of the focus, at least initially, on the primary school setting, or it may include science if indeed eventually we move to the testing being expanded to the secondary sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056559"></A>
While we are talking about the testing, I underline that the policy objective of the testing is to have teacher graduates coming from our universities of the highest possible consistent standard across all the university education faculties before they get into the school setting. The purpose is to have them pass those tests. No-one is interested in failing anyone. The objective is to create an appropriate high bar that reflects the quality of teaching that parents are entitled to expect teacher graduates be afforded through the education faculties of the universities. It is focused on ensuring that those responsible for training teachers, just like those responsible for training carpenters, metalworkers or any other skilled area, are required to take appropriate responsibility for having high standards of training. Graduates benefit from going through a system where they are the beneficiaries of high-quality standard training. They are the immediate beneficiaries, of course, but it is students in the education system across the three sectors who directly benefit and it is their parents who are indirect beneficiaries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056560"></A>
The test is a mechanism whereby we can, by working cooperatively with the universities, lift to a high consistent level the quality of teaching that graduates receive in the university sector. That will now be complemented by the work that has been foreshadowed under the A Flying Start for Queensland Children green paper. We will conduct a cooperative review with all of the universities looking at their education degrees and the teaching that is in those education degrees, particularly addressing the extent to which behaviour management matters are appropriately addressed in this modern era given the realities of the schoolroom and the school setting nowadays. They work hand in hand, with both designed to lift the quality of teaching that graduate teachers receive for their efforts at university which they are then able to take into the schooling sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056561"></A>
In relation to the next point the member raised regarding the costs of the testing, in the second reading debate I did respond to his question about the costings. The department is funding the development and trialling of the tests. This is early days. There is still a lot of work yet to be done by the Queensland College of Teachers. Indeed, this legislation is carrying the legislative remit or head of power for them to formerly undertake the work that is required over the next few years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056562"></A>
The quantification of what the costs might be and what different matters contribute to the costs of the tests are yet to be addressed by the Queensland College of Teachers. The government will work closely with the college over the next six to nine months in getting a clearer idea about what exactly is involved in administering the tests and also the cost implications. As I indicated in my response earlier in the second reading debate, because the costs will be reflected in a regulation that will come back to this House there will be a regulatory assessment process that will have to be gone through in relation to those costs and fees that will involve open community consultation and certainly consultation with the relevant stakeholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056563"></A>
On the third point the member raised in relation to resitting the test, the legislation permits any person who sits the test and does not pass the test to sit another test. They, of course, would not resit that test; they are able to sit another test. They are also able to seek feedback, of course, from the QCT in relation to how they went in the test they did sit but which they did not pass. Then they are able to make their choice, taking guidance from the Queensland College of Teachers, about whether they actually need to do some supplementary training or education to address whatever particular deficiency may have shown up in that first test. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056564"></A>
The short point is they are able to resit another test. They do have the opportunity to pass the test. I think that is a fair thing. The objective is for graduates to succeed at a high standard. We know they are passionate about education, that is why they take it up. We want them to succeed so that they can then succeed in the classroom for the then success of students who get the benefit of their excellent education and teaching. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The response from the minister, for which I thank him, does, however, raise some concerns. I understood him to say--he will correct me if I misunderstood because I would be very concerned if it is what he said--that teachers graduating registering for primary school would not be required to undergo the science test. One of the key recommendations was that primary school teachers feel ill-equipped from their training to teach science in primary school. Primary school science is very important. The minister will correct me if I am wrong, but if that is the correct interpretation of what he said then I am certainly very concerned for the future of primary school teaching of science if we are unable to test the teachers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056566"></A>
The response in relation to what fees are likely to be charged is really an inadequate response. These students are already at university; they are already studying teaching in the seven Queensland education faculties. They will have to pay fees to sit an exam after they graduate from their course. They are already on track for that. But at this point in time the minister is unable to even give a ballpark figure of whether they will be paying $25 or $250. Particularly for students who could be struggling quite a bit financially this is an extra cost they will have to pay on top of the things that happen up to graduation. Given that this bill will put in place things that will start the ball inevitably rolling, they have a right to know that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059831"></A>
Another issue causes me some concern. Certainly I accept that we should allow teachers who fail a subject to resit it. However, no time limit is given between when they fail and when they must resit, so there is no implication that further work, effort or study is required. Also, there does not appear to be any limit on the number of resits. The only thing that might be a limiting factor is the fees that they would have to pay to keep resitting. At this stage we cannot even enlighten them about what those fees could be. It is a concern to me that there will be either no time limit or any limit on the number of times failed teachers could continue to resit. Those three things from the last response cause me a little bit of alarm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059834"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would be distressed if the shadow spokesman was alarmed in any way. I will clarify the first point. The advice I gave in relation to the legal interpretation about ‘and’ and ‘or’ et cetera is correct. The bill has been drafted to create the flexibility for the test to be designed to match the destination of the intended graduate. In the case of science, it may be that teachers going into the secondary sector will not be required to teach science. Science is not bolted on to literacy and numeracy; you do not have to satisfy the science requirements if you are going into secondary teaching. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059835"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Dr Flegg:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 But primary teachers will have to do science?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059836"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Correct. I would expect literacy and numeracy, together with science, would apply in the primary sector. Of course, for the reasons I have just explained, that is not so in the secondary sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059837"></A>
The second point relates to cost. Frankly, it would not be responsible for me to speculate about the costs of the tests at this juncture. With others they have engaged for this purpose, the Queensland College of Teachers is in the early days of developing what is involved in the testing, including the administrative arrangements and an assessment of what the costs will be. At some point that will crystalise and I am advised that there will be public consultation under the regulatory assessment process. We will be able to address that at that time. I think that is the responsible way to deal with it, when we actually have a clearer indication of what the costs will be. I do not think it would be responsible for anyone to speculate that, therefore, they will be enormous or of any particular dimension. It is appropriate for us to wait for advice from the Queensland College of Teachers, which will be given at an appropriate time, on what the estimated costs may be. At that time I will be very happy to talk to the stakeholders about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059838"></A>
The third point relates to the opportunity for a graduate to sit a second or subsequent test. The regulations have the capacity to reflect what QCT might advise us is an appropriate period or number of occasions on which a graduate may sit a further test. We will take advice from the Queensland College of Teachers on that. I underline that the objective is for graduate teachers to display the content knowledge and the teaching skill that match the tests that have been designed to reflect that. Therefore, if they pass it is because they have actually acquired, by whatever appropriate means, the content knowledge and the teaching skill that has been deemed by the Queensland College of Teachers to be appropriate and to be measured by the sitting of these preregistration tests. However, it is the case that the regulations are able to reflect the period over which they could sit a second or subsequent test and how many occasions that might be in that period. We will take advice from the Queensland College of Teachers on that. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.05 pm): Clause 13 relates to the institutions in which teachers can spend time to maintain their currency. In the briefing and subsequently I took a little bit of time to get my head around this issue. I take this opportunity to thank the minister’s staff for the briefing that we had. They were very helpful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059843"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wilson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 I have found them so, as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059844"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sometimes we forget to say ‘thank you’, but I did appreciate the nice, frank briefing. It was a very cooperative briefing. In general, most of my concerns around this clause were satisfied. Basically it refers to someone working out of school, in early childhood, in one of the senior TAFE colleges and the like. That is as expected. I am a little concerned about the small group that includes education advisers in relation to curriculum matters. I would have thought that with people in that sort of work, one year in five spent in the classroom probably would be good for them and would not be an onerous expectation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059845"></A>
Taking that a little bit further, in the provisions under clause 13, does the minister know how many extra teachers would be registered who otherwise would not have been able to be registered? Excuse me if this sounds a bit cynical, but the suggestion was made that, in allowing people to be re-registered and considered to have the equivalent of classroom time when in fact they have not worked in a classroom for five years, the government may be trying to boost the number of teachers that it reports annually. Is the government putting on the books staff who are not classroom teachers and who have not been classroom teachers over the proceeding five years? I understood from somewhere that there are about 20 such people in each education area, so a couple of hundred people do not work in the classroom but would be listed on the books as classroom teachers. Could the minister comment on that? Will this result in a boosting of the number of teachers that the department reports annually, despite the fact that those teachers are five years or more out of the classroom? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063040"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He can set aside any concern about adding to numbers. He might notice that in the briefing notes this issue was identified as an area of tidying up miscellaneous and anomalous circumstances. It has hardly been identified as a major area of new forward thrust in government policy to add to the numbers of teachers registered. To be frank, I am advised that it is responsive to discussions that have taken place between the department and the Queensland College of Teachers about some of the clouded areas that have emerged over the last five years in the operation of the existing legislation. That is what has prompted this particular amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063043"></A>
I am advised, for example, that the new provisions will require that the educational leadership being provided is both consistent and substantial. Mind you, we are dealing with renewal of registration. We are not dealing with someone who has never been registered before and we are not dealing with a provisionally registered person. It is someone who already has full registration and who needs to be renewing that registration before the expiry of that five-year period. I am advised that a person will, therefore, need to demonstrate that they have been engaged on a regular basis in providing expert curriculum and learning advice to, and mentoring for, those delivering an educational program. It is not intended that the experience of a person who is in a role that involves leadership aspects but does not have a direct link to classroom practice will be recognised. This would include a teacher who has undertaken a largely administrative or policy role such as a secondment to central office rather than one directly related to classroom practice. The bill also does not recognise the experience of a person who undertakes or engages in occasional or incidental educational leadership roles or tasks, for example, the delivery of a one-off or occasional seminar about professional development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063044"></A>
In relation to those formerly recognised as education advisers, they should not of course lose touch with the classroom. I acknowledge that in many cases advisers may serve only three years or less in such a role. However, in some specialised areas teachers can remain in advisory positions for longer, for example, the advisory visiting teachers in the various disability areas. In other cases, an adviser may take maternity leave directly following their term as an advisor and can only refer to their time as an adviser when identifying their recency of practice. It should be noted that teacher registrations are generally a mandatory requirement for such advisory teacher roles. Failure to recognise the role for the purpose of renewal is seen as implying a lower status for such roles when in reality we should hope to attract some of our best teachers to those advisory roles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063045"></A>
On the advice given to me I want to assure the shadow spokesperson that these amendments are of a somewhat technical and miscellaneous nature. They were prompted by the discussions that the department has had over recent times with the Queensland College of Teachers and acting on the basis of those discussions to try to address some of the improvements that are believed by the Queensland College of Teachers and the department to be appropriate to finetune the legislation that has been operating for about five years or so since we set up the QCT. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063049"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I did take some comfort in those comments that were in the notes, because I think it is very important. My concern was around the integrity of the figures that we publish every year as a reliable guide. As an example, in the health department there are people who are qualified nurses and doctors but when they fill administration roles they can be counted as medical staff and professional staff. You can get a false impression of the resources that are available to treat patients. I am concerned that when we talk about teachers in the education department we are actually talking about somebody who is in a classroom teaching students. Thank you for that answer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063051"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Can I add that I have the highest regard for the Queensland College of Teachers and the advice that it gives to us as a government. It is independent of the government. It has a wider spectrum of stakeholder representation on it, enabling it to provide the soundest advice to government. We would not be acting in this way unless we understood from the Queensland College of Teachers that this was an appropriate step on balance to deal with a reality that it has experienced over the years in administering this important legislation about teacher registration which, at the end of the day, is designed to ensure that we have quality teachers going into our classrooms across the three school sectors. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (5.16 pm): I am very pleased to be able to make a few comments in relation to this bill. It is a very large bill in size in terms of the number of pages--533 pages. It is a significant bill, besides that point. Nevertheless, as I see it, there are two main objectives to the bill. The first is to create a far more efficient system by reducing duplication with respect to the issue of blue cards, yellow cards and so on and, secondly, to bring about a consistency of approach in criminal history screening by the amalgamation of various categories of workers providing services to children. As I understand it, these are the two main thrusts of those 533 pages. I would have thought that those objectives are, on anyone’s understanding, desirable and laudable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063071"></A>
Looking at them more closely, the first being the reduction of duplication, specifically, this will apply to, first of all, police officers and registered teachers. In their case, police officers and registered teachers will be able to apply for an exemption from holding a blue card when providing child related services outside their professional duties. I take it that that means, for example, a teacher or a police officer being involved in looking after children apart from when they are performing police duties or teaching duties. It might be volunteering in a sporting role, scouts, girl guides or something of that nature. As I understand it from the reading of the bill, they would be able to apply for an exemption in relation to those sorts of activities. Also, blue card holders can apply for exemption from holding a yellow card. It makes a great deal of sense to me for them to be able to do that. Also, registered health practitioners, including not just doctors but also nurses and midwives, will be automatically exempt from requiring a blue or yellow card when they are providing services to children as well as adults with a disability as part of their professional duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063100"></A>
The only query I have is why that automatic exemption applies to health practitioners but it does not apply to blue card holders seeking an exemption from holding a yellow card and it does not apply to police officers or registered teachers in the instance that I gave before. The minister might be kind enough to explain that. It may be because registered health practitioners are performing part of their professional duties, whereas police officers and teachers in the instance that I gave are not engaged in their professional duties but are doing something else. That may be the simple explanation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063103"></A>
The second point that I mentioned as being a laudable objective was consistency. We see here the amalgamation in the blue card screening of all persons providing services to children with a disability, all employees and volunteers of state government entities who are engaged in child related matters, health students undertaking placements that involve service delivery to children whether those activities are provided in the public or the private sphere, and all employees and volunteers engaged by local governments undertaking child related roles.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063104"></A>
The only other aspect that I want to mention relates to the matters raised in the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
No. 2 of this year. The comments in that document remind us of what the law of Queensland is, particularly in relation to section 4(2) of the Legislative Standards Act--that is, in the legislation that we deal with in this place, we have to have sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals, particularly a person’s right to employment. It relates to disclosure of information, including personal information, to various entities that might be considering employing a person.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063106"></A>
The <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
refers to the provision of a person’s criminal history and the provision of information concerning convictions, and very few people would have any problem with that. However, it also refers to the fact that there is provision for the exchange of information regarding charges, expired convictions and ‘information’ from interstate police. As well as that, it refers to ‘investigative information’ about certain alleged offences that did not result in a charge being laid, let alone a conviction being recorded.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063107"></A>
The <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
also refers to the state’s legislative history that is relevant to this point and mentions that piece of legislation that was passed in the dying years of the conservative regime in the eighties--that piece of enlightened legislation called the Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act. The danger is, and the point the committee raises is, that there is a continual watering down of the protections that were provided for in the Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act. I certainly have a real concern about that and I think I will continue to have that concern.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063110"></A>
The general rule that was recognised in the Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act was that, after the expiration of a rehabilitation period--of five or 10 years depending on the type of offence--there was not a need to disclose past criminal convictions. In fact, there was a prohibition against people disclosing the criminal convictions. Officials considering a person’s fitness for a profession or other purpose had to disregard the conviction. There were, however, some provisions made for matters to apply where the person involved had in fact reoffended--in other words, they gave away the benefit of that act. Of course, those matters were dealing with convictions and we have come a long way since then in the sense that we now include mere charges and mere investigative information which is not even known to the applicant for the job.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063111"></A>
I have a concern about these matters and I ask the minister to comment on those concerns in her summing-up. I congratulate the minister for the considerable amount of work that has been undertaken in the 533-page piece of legislation that we have before the House today. The protection of children is the paramount aim of the minister and the government, and I hope the parliament will see that achieved tonight. I commend the minister and the government for its efforts in this regard. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (5.26 pm): I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill and the shadow minister’s Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. It is a tragic day when we must devote nearly 550 pages of legislation to amending the systems designed to protect our children and our most vulnerable members of society. It is a sad indictment on the world we live in that these are the steps we must take to ensure certain individuals are prohibited from interacting with our children, our sick and our disabled. I sorely wish there was another way--a way that did not impinge or intrude so abruptly and completely on the rights and liberties of so many true, upstanding citizens, a way that did not overrule their rights to privacy, a way that did not create potential limitations over their employment opportunities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063114"></A>
Whilst I would hope a better resourced police force or corrective services or child protection services would negate the need for blue cards, yellow cards and teacher or police registration, I know it would not. So a form of criminal history screening has necessarily become an inevitable burden on law-abiding Queenslanders. The challenge now is to make that system as robust and foolproof as possible, whilst maintaining a level of simplicity that ensures the more than 500,000 history checks that are processed are done so expeditiously and with sensitivity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063115"></A>
I am pleased to say that both bills we are debating today achieve that. The Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to do so through reducing the duplication of such screening processes and by increasing the consistency across the screening regimes. The Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill seeks to address the protection needs of people with disabilities by ensuring they are not placed in the care of an employed carer with a violent criminal history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063116"></A>
If I spend a moment considering the first of these bills--the government’s screening bill--I acknowledge the efforts to reduce undue bureaucracy and red tape. It does this by the following: by allowing registered teachers and police officers to apply for an exemption from holding a blue card when providing child regulated services which are outside of their professional duties; by recognising the blue card and corresponding criminal history check of new applicants for teacher registration; by allowing exemptions for blue card holders requiring yellow cards; by automatically exempting registered health practitioners from requiring blue or yellow cards when providing services to children and adults with disabilities as part of their professional duties; by extending the renewal period for blue and yellow cards from two years to three years; by aligning the exclusionary framework of the blue card, yellow card and registration systems as much as possible; by increasing the ability within the blue and yellow card systems to access certain criminal information; and by amalgamating certain screenings into the blue card system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063117"></A>
As I said, each of these steps are commendable. I honestly hope that this will reduce the number of checks undertaken by the touted 100,000 in the first three years. I know that my former colleagues and many across the child protection sector--particularly those in the central screening unit--will let out a collective acclamation of joy. I know that many will rejoice at the potential improvements in processing times this will deliver. I appreciate this will also reduce costs on the various government agencies and certainly in the case of paid employees requiring a blue card.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Why don’t you go back to your seat? Then they spent the next hour trying to get it ruled out of order because they did not want to hear this sort of debate. Very obviously the Premier is now saying that it is stupid and it is a waste of time. We are not wasting the time of the members of this House when we call on the Labor Party to listen to its local members who deserve to have a convention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063166"></A>
We could have moved that this House support the right of Labor Party branch members to have their say and call on the federal Labor executive to ensure the 2010 Queensland annual conference of the Labor Party proceeds. We made an invitation to all members of the caucus, to their electorate officers and to unions so that they could be represented here today to see if they are going to stand up for the Labor Party constituency. Let us have a look at the history. On 7 June last year the Premier addressed the 2009 state conference of the Queensland Labor Party at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063168"></A>
I note that when the honourable member for Gladstone suggested a similar motion--that the federal government should pass on interest rate reductions a couple of years ago--that was not objected to by the Labor Party on the grounds that it may offend the standing orders, and I thank you for your ruling this morning, Mr Speaker.</Hansard-Body>

The Premier at the convention told the delegates they should support asset sales. She said, ‘Confronted with the challenges of the global recession, we offered the electorate a Labor solution.’ The mind boggles! This is a Premier so out of touch that she presents her campaign to cut from the government the jobs of thousands of rail workers, labourers and admin workers as an idea Labor should support. She appeared before an audience who had campaigned on her behalf, who did not know that when they handed out those how to-vote cards and when they stood on those booths they were selling a gross fabrication.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They do not like to hear it, do they? The Premier who spruiked ‘jobs not cuts’ was out with her razor telling the party faithful to line up and cop it. So the Premier spent her last conference weekend friendless, begging for support from delegates for her previously unannounced plan to sell QR, Forestry Plantations Queensland, Queensland Motorways and the Port of Brisbane, or else asking them not to turn up for the vote. Standing at the lectern, she claimed she had a mandate for what she was doing. ‘It is a mandate with a message,’ she said. ‘We have to hear that message.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063173"></A>
The Premier was just 78 days out from the election, but in 78 days her popularity among the Labor faithful had crashed. There among the delegates the Premier had big problems. Like all Queenslanders, they felt--and they were--deceived, cheated and conned. It is no wonder that this Premier is running fast away from any danger that she might have to front another Labor convention any time soon. She is running as fast as her feet will take her from any forum within which Labor members might get the chance to tell the Premier what they think of her mandate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063174"></A>
Premier Bligh is not the only one running from the storm clouds gathering over the convention centre. She is running like a startled rabbit, but two months ago something loomed up behind her and then shot past like a bullet out of a gun. What was it? It was Prime Minister Rudd. It was Kevin Rudd, who takes the blind support of the Labor rank and file for granted. It was Kevin Rudd, whose incompetent, bureaucratic and lately deadly administration is floundering. It is Kevin Rudd under pressure from Tony Abbott and just six months or so from an election. Those opposite laughed this morning but they are not laughing now.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063175"></A>
Today in Queensland the Premier is a lightning rod for the complaints of Queenslanders whose jobs are on the state government chopping block along with the government agencies that provide them. The Premier is a lightning rod, but the Prime Minister’s ETS has him hooked up to a high-voltage transformer of white-hot anger from across Australia. Neither want to have to explain their odorous policies or face the music from rank and file workers who have had enough of being guiled by the Prime Minister and duped by the Premier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063178"></A>
In this country there is a strong democratic tradition. Throughout history our political parties have valued and respected Australia’s democratic beliefs. Even today, with union bosses stacking the vote to carry Premier Bligh through the 2009 ALP conference and frogmarching ministers in and out of cabinet, the Premier’s party pays lip-service to electoral fair play on its website. This is what it says on the website: ‘Party members are the core of the Labor Party. Party members and local branches play a central role in innovative policy development.’ I say this to Labor members opposite: they may play a central role, but when it comes to power in the ALP some are more central than others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063182"></A>
Remember the recent findings of the Queensland Council of Unions’ poll. Just one in 10 Queenslanders supports privatisation; 59 per cent say that asset sales make them less likely to vote Labor; 66 per cent will not forget; 80 per cent think the government underestimated opposition to asset sales; 70 per cent do not agree with the share float of Queensland Rail; and 74 per cent think Premier Bligh misled the public and kept her plans secret. Premier Bligh is the incoming National President of the Australian Labor Party. The Premier gets her turn at the wheel for 12 months beginning in July, and she takes control right at the time ALP members would expect to attend their 2010 State Conference. Unfortunately for them, the Premier and other Labor figures from Queensland lobbied party bosses, and the weekend before last they agreed to cancel all state conferences in this federal election year. This is an affront not just to angry unionists demanding a special convention to roll Premier Bligh on the asset sales and to Queensland ALP members who want their say unfettered by this unfair gag. It is an affront to all Queenslanders who expect parties to honour their constitutions and to behave in an open and democratic fashion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063184"></A>
The image of the Prime Minister turning tail and running away from the smelly policies of the Labor Party in Queensland is a disgrace to the principles on which his party was founded. The image of the Premier barricaded in her president’s office while hardworking Labor campaigners protest outside is another disgrace. It is a double disgrace since the Premier sits here in this chamber pretending to be accountable but turning a deaf ear to her own members and supporters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063186"></A>
On this side of the chamber we are proud that our leaders have shown none of these cowardly tendencies. When Bob Quinn, a former parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, proposed dramatic reforms to internal rules governing preselection and representation within his organisation, he fronted the Liberal Party convention. At the time it was speculated that the proposals would not please the then Prime Minister, John Howard. Did Prime Minister Howard run away and hide? No, he did not. He attended and fronted that meeting, and it was the democratic view of party members that prevailed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063187"></A>
Similarly, shortly after Mr Howard proposed sweeping new gun laws in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre a National Party convention was due in Queensland, and again there was speculation about the likely reaction of party members. Was that National Party convention cancelled? It was not. What is more, the Liberal Prime Minister attended the Nationals conference and fronted rank and file members. That is the democratic tradition which we represent and honour in this House and across the state of Queensland. The Premier cannot follow this course and pretend to Queenslanders that she is a serious parliamentary representative. Do not climb up on the public stage and then dive for cover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063188"></A>
In closing, here are some of the Premier’s words from the 2009 ALP conference. ‘I have made some tough calls recently--calls I never imagined I’d be confronted with--but if there are choices to be made, I will make them.’ Premier, it is not tough to hide the government’s true intentions from Queenslanders at a time when they expect and are entitled to demand complete honesty. It is not tough to duck for cover or bow to the craven weaknesses of the Prime Minister, even if it is at some small risk to his political hide. Premier, the tough call is to give ALP members their right to have their say on the dangerous meanderings of this Labor government and that of Mr Rudd.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063189"></A>
In her speech the Premier singled out some of the true believers: the people who have stood up to be counted and have backed the ALP in the truly tough times--women like Billie Pelling, who worked to establish the Gordonvale women’s branch of the ALP in 1963. The Premier should think about her salute to Billie Pelling and remember her obligations to members who expect their say at their annual conference. I say to the Premier: it is her call. She needs to toughen up and stand by those who have stood by her. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (5.39 pm): I rise to second the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Surfers Paradise. ‘You can count on me,’ the Premier said, hand on heart, as she forced an early election upon the decent folk of Queensland. ‘You can count on me,’ said a Premier so desperate to become Queensland’s first elected female Premier that she sold out the people of this great state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067020"></A>
This debate is about honesty and truthfulness--two words used very loosely by members opposite. Just like the words ‘open’ and ‘transparent’, they fall from Labor members’ lips with insincere frequency and alacrity. So long had the Premier been tutored by the greatest spin doctor of them all--Beattie--she had forgotten what they meant. Fanfare, spin and a stunt a day kept voters at bay for a whole decade. But just as they were cottoning on to this vaudeville act of Beattie and Bligh, Beattie up and left before the tricks he and Bligh played on Queenslanders were revealed, before he could be blamed--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067021"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! I do not want to interrupt the creative flow of the honourable member, but you will refer to the Premier by the correct title. That way, we will maintain dignity in the debate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067022"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The former Premier left before the tricks the current Premier and Mr Beattie played on Queenslanders were revealed, before he could be blamed for plunging Queensland into a black hole of debt. The new Premier simply picked up where he left off. But rather than jump into shark tanks and other flashy stunts designed to draw the media, she preferred to don a hard hat--a hard hat here, a hard hat there, a hard hat everywhere, even when they were not warranted for safety purposes. Tony Fitzgerald’s ferocious public attack on the Bligh government’s 12 years of secrecy, cronyism and corruption in July last year, stating that Labor considered accountability to be ‘collateral damage’ in its fight to retain power, was so much of a close call for the Bligh government that the Premier was forced to hastily react to the accusations by issuing discussion papers and new legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067023"></A>
Again in August last year the Premier was telling Queenslanders they could count on her--this time to clean up the mess created by pay-per-view politics involving Labor linked lobbyists. ‘I know that tackling these issues means taking on some pretty powerful players,’ she said. Now that was close to the truth, but she did not mention these were players she played with often--players who knew the game rules and knew that if they did not pay then they did not get a say. It was Labor’s way or no highway, no railway, no resort. On 21 January this year the Premier said with regard to the sale of assets--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067025"></A>
I do not shy away from any form of debate on this issue either in the Labor Party or outside of it.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1067026"></A>
She should have added ‘unless I can control the outcome’, as was the case at last year’s Labor state conference when, curiously, there were voting members absent for a crucial vote on asset sales.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067027"></A>
People are not stupid. They are working out for themselves that they were tricked by this government at the last election, and they do not like it! No-one likes to be made a fool of, even less so when they place trust in someone or something such as the Premier and the Labor Party. They do not like losing the fuel subsidy. They do not like vehicle registration hikes. They do not like paying crippling costs for their electricity or their water. They do not like filling in sustainability declaration forms. They do not like being denied access to discounted solar hot-water systems. Most of all, they do not like having Queensland’s assets sold off, and particularly at bargain basement prices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067029"></A>
Amidst all this unrest Mike Kaiser popped into the spotlight again, hand-picked by the Premier after the fall of Morris Iemma in New South Wales. Kaiser, a self-confessed rorter from the Shepherdson inquiry, was given a plum job and a plum salary to assist the Queensland Premier. But before long Kaiser got a whiff that the Premier’s popularity was tumbling, so he jumped ship to work for the NBN project under circumstances that have raised questions of integrity. No wonder the Premier is worried about her job. Even Kaiser has deserted her!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067030"></A>
In May 2008 then Premier Morris Iemma overturned 117 years of ALP history on sanctity of conference by introducing legislation into New South Wales for the partial privatisation of the state’s power industry. For his arrogance he fell on his own factional sword. By announcing legislation to allow asset sales of state owned entities before taking it to a state conference, the Premier was considered by some to be in breach of her own party policy. Perhaps the Premier has a case of the nervous Nellies. After all, look what happened to Iemma. She started talking about herself in the third person--a sure sign of delusional behaviour! So self-absorbed, she is no longer able to connect with the world around her. Failure to oppose moves to cancel or postpone the ALP state conference would highlight these incompetencies further and deny rank-and-file members their right to vote.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (5.44 pm): The government opposes this motion. The government opposes the pathetic waste of time that the LNP proposes to put into this parliament for the sorts of debates that one might expect to be conducted at the university Liberal versus Labor club. What we see here are members of an opposition so bereft of ideas, so bereft of an agenda and so bereft of any ability to put forward an alternative of their own that they seek to occupy the time of this parliament in a debate about the internal mechanisms of the Australian Labor Party. Well, let me say this: so impotent are they in their confected rage here that they are reaching out in a pathetic attempt to talk to the rank and file of the Australian Labor Party.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067037"></A>
Let us understand this position. This Labor Party put this motion to a conference properly constituted and it passed through that conference. Each and every one of those delegates at that conference knew exactly what they were doing. Those of us who have been to a Labor Party conference would know that. In fact, that is all of us on this side plus at least the Leader of the Opposition, who tried to go to the last conference with the sort of success that he has had here tonight in his call to arms as one looks up at the packed public gallery. He sent out his call to arms to unionists from around the state to come and hear his contribution, to recognise that he stood as the new torchbearer for the rights of working people. I invite honourable members to cast their eyes above to see the empty gallery, because what the people of Queensland know--what every unionist knows, what every member of the Australian Labor Party knows--is that this is confected rage. This is the greatest act of deceit attempted to be perpetrated on the people of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067042"></A>
What we have here is a Leader of the Opposition who at his core believes in privatisation, who has voted for privatisation in this parliament, who has given impassioned speeches in favour of privatisation in this parliament, who has come into this parliament and moved amendments to the effect that public education should be provided by private corporations. And now he comes in here and asks us to believe that the confected rage that he puts forward, in a ham-fisted acting attempt, is what he actually believes! Well, none of us believes that and the people of Queensland will not believe it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067046"></A>
Following this debate is a bit like following Dickie Knee and Patsy Biscoe. We have the Dickie Knee of Queensland politics. If you spun him around and put a hat on it, you would not be able to tell the difference, because someone else is playing the tune. This is merely a puppet. This is merely a puppet charading in the parliament, pretending to the leader. The only difference is that someone had the good idea to stick a broomstick in the back of Dickie Knee to give him a backbone. The reality is that this is a puppeteered effort of an individual who came into this parliament and is now today a shrivelled soul--a shrivelled kernel of his former self.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067047"></A>
We did not want him at the last conference and we do not want him at the next conference, because the Australian Labor Party will always draw on its strength--its capacity for strength and courage, its capacity to be the agents of change, its capacity to make the tough decisions for working people right around the state--and we do not need the likes of the Leader of the Opposition with his deceit, his duplicity and his spineless leadership that will not stand for anything. All through our history, through the travails and the troubles, through the times at which we have been the agents of change for this nation and this state, we have drawn upon what resides within us and we do not need--thank you very much--the woeful contribution offered by the Leader of the Opposition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067050"></A>
What this parliament deserves at times like this, in the one hour that is provided by the government to the opposition, is for it to put forward policy ideas. What a pathetic waste of this parliament’s time! Those opposite were carping at the start of the week that they wanted a greater opportunity to debate. They wanted a lot more time to say nothing. They wanted more speeches from ‘Lord Monckton of Warrego’--20 minutes where they do not put forward an idea. What have they done with their one hour here tonight? They come in here with the sort of UQ Labor-Liberal club agenda. This might be fascinating to the student members of the Liberal club who are occupying the Leader of the Opposition’s office and writing this tripe for him, but the reality is this: the time has come for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and put forward a policy agenda.</Hansard-Body>

 No, because the people of Queensland expect an opposition to put forward an idea, to put forward a policy proposition and to not come in here and waste this parliament’s time. This government will stand on the strength and the history of the ALP as being the agent of change, of having the courage to come in here and put forward an idea. What the members opposite should do at 5.30 pm on the Wednesday of the next sitting week is come in here and tell us about their plans for job creation and service delivery and concern themselves less with those on this side.</Hansard-Body>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (5.49 pm): This debate marks new depths in the pathetic and parlous nature of the Liberal National Party and its concern for the people of Queensland. To think that the LNP would take its time to debate a motion--a time that could be dedicated to debating any pressing issue facing the people of Queensland--about the ALP internal processes is a disgrace. This is the LNP’s opportunity to put forward policy, or hold the government to account, yet it uses it to debate the internal workings of the ALP. I guarantee that not one of my constituents will ask me where I stand on the ALP national executive’s decision on the state conference. When I am at the Meadowbrook IGA, not one person will pull me up in the aisle and ask me what is happening with that special state conference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067096"></A>
In 2010, the workers of Queensland and Australia have a very important choice. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has delivered a fair and balanced industrial relations system that protects vulnerable workers from the exploitation that is at the heart of Work Choices. At the same time, Tony Abbott has come to the Australian people offering up the Work Choices policies that were rejected by the Australian electorate in 2007. The union movement of Queensland will be firmly focused on promoting the rights of workers regardless of political persuasion. Just as the union movement will do, the ALP across Australia will ensure that every effort in 2010 is spent defending the Fair Work Act and making sure that Tony Abbott does not get his hands on the rights of workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067099"></A>
Let me talk about the LNP’s duplicitous and shameless attempt to appeal to the Queensland union movement’s right to be involved politically on behalf of its members. It was the LNP that tried to bring laws to this place requiring unions to spend union dues to go through expensive referenda so that they could have any say in the ALP. It was the LNP that tried to crush Queensland’s union movement through Santo Santoro’s Workplace Relations Act 1997 while at the same time stripping away from Queensland workers penalty rates and other award conditions. It was the LNP that wanted to prevent unions campaigning against people who promised to strip away the work rights of union members. Generally, that is because it is the LNP that is attacking the workers whom the union movement is defending. It was the LNP that described those who are elected by union members in this state as union thugs, union bosses and union mates. These are the same people who try to sell to Queenslanders that tired old line that unions are third-party interference, yet want to come to this chamber and defend the right of unions to represent their members politically. There was nothing clearer to show what the LNP members thought of unions when they sat here and voted for Work Choices. They simply do not understand what workers face when they try to protect not only their rights but also their dignity and their self-respect at work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067101"></A>
The most duplicitous member is the member for Southern Downs, with his performance on the issue of asset sales. He has descended to personal insults to those people who have been elected to represent Queensland workers’ industrial interests. He has come into this place and called union leaders pansies, jellyfish and spineless. He and his minions, such as the member for Buderim, have been secretly trying to court union leaders, asking for joint media conferences and statements with vague and unintelligible overtures that they would reverse the decision. They have been making secret phone calls to try to court our union leaders of Queensland, but they have been rejected. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1067102"></A>
As always, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is talking behind his hand. He is making secret advances while at the same time deliberately misleading workers by saying that the rail unions have supported privatisation. Unfortunately, his secret advances for an affair have been rejected. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not even say that he would leave his current commitment--that profound ideological commitment to crush unions, destroy public sector jobs and sell state assets. In the short-shrift response they have given to the LNP’s cheap and insincere advances, Queensland’s union leaders have shown that they can see through its cheap political opportunism. That is why the Leader of the Opposition’s letter to unions asking them to come to the debate tonight has been the own goal that it is--just like this entire debate. Unfortunately, own goals have been the story of this Leader of the Opposition’s leadership. Maybe he should realise that only half his enemies are in front of him. </Hansard-Body>

 (Gympie--LNP) (5.54 pm): Not since the 1950s, with Thomas Dunstan, has a member for Gympie risen in this chamber to speak in the interests of the rank and file of the Labor Party. It is as if we have entered a parallel universe. Under this Bligh government we have found a Labor Party that Thomas Dunstan and others would not recognise--a Labor Party that has sold out its core values, a Labor Party that would not know what the Labor movement was about. This is what we are seeing here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067106"></A>
We heard the most unpopular member of this parliament--and no doubt the state’s worst Treasurer--put forward the proposition that this motion is a waste of the parliament’s time. May I put forward to the member for Mount Coot-tha perhaps some other moments in this parliament’s recent history were a far greater waste of time. What springs to mind at first is the minute’s silence for a drug trafficker. If ever 60 seconds in this parliament was wasted, it was that motion. It was an insult to those in our community who have to deal with the issue. But another waste of the time of this parliament perpetrated on the people of Queensland by this government--and a waste of taxpayers’ dollars--was the recalling of parliament for Gordon Nuttall. That was a time that was clearly wasted. That was a time when we saw this Labor government show its true colours. So to have the member for Mount Coot-tha--the most unpopular member of this parliament, the state’s worst Treasurer--come in here and lecture us about a waste of time is indeed something that takes the cake. </Hansard-Body>

As has quite rightly been pointed out, this motion comes down to those core elements of integrity and honesty. Whilst I will not profess for a minute to understand the machinations within the Labor Party--I do not think a crack addict could understand the machinations of the Labor Party--I note with great interest the argument put forward that it is an election year and, therefore, the ALP should not be having a state conference. I thought to myself, ‘Surely, that has been done before?’ A little bit of research has shown me that in July 2007--an election year--there was a state conference. Perhaps in 2004 the ALP scrapped it? That would have been one that it would have been concerned about. No, the ALP held a state conference. What about in 2001? There was an election in that year that the ALP wanted to win. So should it have held a state conference? The ALP held a state conference. What about in the election year of 1998? Surely that was a year that the ALP suspended the state conference. </Hansard-Body>

Mr GIBSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There has. We have to go back beyond 1993. So the ALP has form. I understand that. In fact, there was a while there when the ALP did not hold any conferences. That must make us wonder what it is about the Australian Labor Party and its view on democracy. Surely, the ALP’s state conferences are for the same purpose that most people would think a political party has a state conference, and that is to check the views of their members--look at the attitudes to ensure that they are reflected in its policies. State conferences would be an opportunity to do that. But what do we find from this government? It is running from the idea that it might have its policies representing its own members’ views, running from the idea that perhaps its policies represent the views of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067112"></A>
Clearly it does not. We have seen from recent polls that this government is so out of touch with the views of Queensland, so arrogant and so dishonest, that its members would not know what ordinary Queenslanders wanted if they fell over it. They find themselves in a position where they are disconnected from the views of ordinary Queenslanders. The arrogant attitude they display shows that they do not deserve government. </Hansard-Body>

However, any flickering interest I had in satire has well and truly been doused by the Leader of the Opposition tonight masquerading as the workers’ friend, saving the Labor Party and the union. What an absolute outrageous joke. I will just quote from a few things in relation to democracy. </Hansard-Body>

 I am not as versed in the history of the LNP as those opposite are. The LNP state executive has been trying to silence critics, the Leader of the Opposition being one of them, of course, and there are many of them. For instance, Gary Hardgrave has been given a show-cause notice as to why he should not be expelled. Why? The notice relates to comments he made about the state opposition being hopeless. He made the comments not as an LNP member but as a radio announcer. For telling the truth the member for Burnett was dropped from the high office of deputy whip because he dared to vote for a spill. In my opinion those opposite came to the right decision about the member for the grassy knoll. I think the right result was achieved. Everyone knows that he was 16 before he learnt to wave goodbye. The LNP has sought to silence other critics, such as Mal Brough. </Hansard-Body>

 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.05 pm): Contempt, arrogance and deceit. That is what we have heard from the other side of this House tonight. It was absolutely personified by the Treasurer, the most unpopular member of parliament, a member of parliament who could not even get a primary vote above body temperature. This is a guy who could not get a primary vote above 38 per cent. This is the most unpopular, useless Treasurer that the people of Queensland have ever seen. We have seen the contempt of this person here tonight. He has said to the people’s parliament that they have no right to be heard. I have news for the Treasurer and member for Mount Coot-tha: the reason that we are debating this issue tonight is because those opposite are too scared to debate it at a Labor Party convention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067169"></A>
This government, this Treasurer, is now bereft of any democratic principles whatsoever. They are scared of their own membership. What would those people who stood by that tree 100-odd years ago in the member for Gregory’s electorate and actually established the Labor Party think about this mob of charlatans and frauds and those people who have walked away from the principles of the Labor Party? Would those people, the hard workers of that area who actually set up this party, have walked away from a philosophical or ideological argument? No, they would not have done, because this is a party that was forged in a cauldron of adversity and austerity at the time. We may not necessarily agree with it ideologically, but you could certainly respect it. No longer can you respect it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067170"></A>
The reason that we are having this debate here tonight is because we have a Premier who by virtue of her position will be the incoming president of the Labor Party of Australia and she is not prepared to stand up for the fundamental, democratic rights of Labor Party members and what they are saying. As we have seen again tonight, this government does not understand the level of palpable anger that exists in the community. This level of palpable anger is accompanied by arrogance and deceit from this government. The anger actually exists because those members of the Labor Party are upset that they have been let down by this government. That is why the polls are so bad. That is why their members are upset. That is why some members of the union movement, the ones who are not two-faced--and there is only a handful of them--are out there demanding another conference. But there is only a handful. The majority of the unions behind the scenes are doing a nudge, nudge, wink, wink exercise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067171"></A>
Last year the unions went to the Labor Party conference. Some of them decided they would vote for privatisation, others decided they would vote against it and others decided they would not vote at all; they would go and hide under a couch somewhere. That is exactly what they did. But it was all contrived. There has been one union though that has shown at least some semblance of ticker and that has been the ETU. They have booted out a whole range of Labor members who they believe no longer subscribe to their principles. Those members are now running around homeless. The member for Barron River has found a new home today. The Australian Services Union has adopted him. The member for Cook is still running around looking for a refuge. He says he cannot find one but that it is not really a priority.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071195"></A>
One really has to ask the question: what is the Labor Party scared of? What is the Premier scared of? Why won’t they listen to their members? Why won’t they let their members be heard? It is no accident. It is their own doing that there has been an enormous dive in the popularity of and support for this government within the community. Why is that? It is because they have deceived the people of Queensland. They have treated those people with contempt and those people want a chance to have their say. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071198"></A>
The rank-and-file Labor members want to have their say, too. It is absolutely unprecedented that, in an election year, when the state faces such important issues, we have a Labor Premier who so arrogantly dismisses the rank-and-file concerns of Labor Party members in Queensland. Is it any wonder that her own branches have passed motions of no confidence? Is it any wonder that her own branches want her expelled from the Labor Party? There is a chance for the Premier to redeem herself. Finally she can open her ears and understand that she has, in her own hands, the chance to have this conference by virtue of her position as the incoming president of the Labor Party and not run away. </Hansard-Body>

 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (6.10 pm): Tonight with this motion the LNP plumbs new depths in its own laziness, new depths in partisan pettiness and new depths in disregard for the proper business of this House. The time for this debate is set aside on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 to enable the opposition to interrogate the actions of government, to debate the policy framework of the government and to showcase itself as the alternative government. It gets to do that in here, in the House, on the record and accountable to the people of Queensland. But what do we see tonight? We see cheap partisan political point scoring. How is it the business of this House to debate a decision of the Australian Labor Party national executive regarding the scheduling of internal party forums? How is it the best use of Her Majesty’s opposition’s time to have this debate and how does this debate showcase an alternative government? The fact is that it does not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071211"></A>
The LNP is saying, ‘What you get from us is what you have come to expect from us: a deep and enduring focus on the internal divisions of politics.’ This showcases the one thing the LNP has mastered over the years, which is petty division. There are a couple of aspects to this debate I will comment on. The first is the Leader of the Opposition calling for a government conscience vote on this motion. What a joke! In the Australian democracy, the role of the conscience vote is well understood by everyone except those opposite. A conscience vote is determined by the matter before the House, dealing primarily with issues of a moral, ethical or religious nature. Last week we saw an example of matters like this in the debate on the surrogacy bill. That debate required members to consider their core values and evaluate issues of gravity affecting the rights of children. That debate had strong lobbying by religious and civil rights organisations. What did we see from the opposition in the surrogacy debate? We saw a party lockup and the denial of a conscience vote for its own side. The matter before the House today--</Hansard-Body>

Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The matter before the House tonight is not a matter for a conscience vote. It is a petty partisan stunt. However, I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if that is what he believes then he should give his members of parliament a conscience vote on this motion. He should tell them there will be no repercussions for not supporting the motion. He should tell them they will not be sacked as committee chairs and they will not be sacked as deputy whips. He should tell them there will be no repercussions. He should say this: ‘If you think this is the best use of our time, then support the motion.’</Hansard-Body>

Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He should tell his members, ‘If you think this is the best use of the time allocated to you, to raise issues of ALP conferences, then support the motion.’ He should also tell them this: ‘If you think we should be debating education issues rather than ALP conferences, you can vote against it. If you think a better use of our time would be to debate health or the economy rather than ALP conferences, then vote against it. If you think we should be presenting our own policy framework as an alternative government, rather than debating ALP conferences, then vote against it.’ But he will not do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071218"></A>
The national executive of the Labor Party is considering a resolution requiring state branches to seek national executive support prior to holding conferences. This is about ensuring the party is focused on delivering the best outcome for working families during a critical election year. State conferences require significant resource allocation in their organisation and administration. They take several months of work--arranging travel, accommodation for delegates, lead-up committee work, publication preparation and so on. However, let there be no mistake that the Australian Labor Party’s national organisation is focused on one aim: ensuring we do not return to the antiworker policies of the Liberal and National parties, and we make no apologies for that. There is nothing sinister or secret about it. In fact, the only sinister aspect is the threat of a Tony Abbott government and the return to individual worker contracts. The ABC has reported Tony Abbott as saying he would relax unfair dismissal laws and reintroduce statutory non-union contracts if he won the election. He said, ‘That is what we had under the Howard government and that is what we need to have again.’ The Labor Party will remain focused on never returning to the LNP’s Work Choices world and we will not shy away from it. We will do whatever we can to protect working families. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (6.16 pm): I rise to support the motion that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition and seconded by the member for Currumbin. The member for Currumbin defined tonight’s debate when she said that this is a debate about honesty and integrity. It is not so much a debate about a policy decision. It is not a debate about the sell-off of Queensland’s assets, per se. It is a debate about the honesty and integrity of the Premier. It is a debate about the honesty and the integrity of the Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071221"></A>
It was instructive to watch the government members who had to respond to the proposition that the Premier take a small step to partially redress the anger that has been caused by her lack of honesty and her lack of integrity. What was the response of those Labor members? We have seen an outpouring of insult and invective like this parliament has seldom seen before. If one listened to the members on the other side of the House, one would think that this debate was about the LNP. Attacking the LNP does not cure the problem. Attacking the LNP does not hide the dishonesty and the lack of integrity that was involved in this decision which has angered Queenslanders across-the-board, not so much for the decision itself but for the sneaky way in which it was made. It has not just angered Queenslanders across-the-board; it has also angered the core supporters of the Labor Party, the Premier and the government that made it because it was cloaked in dishonesty and lacked any integrity. It was done without any of the normal processes that should be part of our democratic processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071222"></A>
The motion before the House tonight gives the Premier and the government a small chance to redress some of that anger. They have singularly refused to provide an explanation as to why they are not prepared to do that. Members have used this opportunity to insult anyone who suggests they should do that. Members such as the member for Brisbane Central typify the hypocrisy of Labor members of this government. The member for Brisbane Central is the classic union parasite, who comes into this House on the back of workers, who makes a career of having her hand in workers’ pockets and then, when she gets into this place, completely abandons the principles that she espoused to get here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071260"></A>
If those members believed those principles that they espoused to get here they would be voting with us tonight. They would be voting to give those people whom they represent an opportunity to have a say, an opportunity to express an opinion, an opportunity to let the Premier and the government know what they think about the decision that was made with so much dishonesty and such a lack of integrity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071261"></A>
That is only the first step. The motion before the House tonight asks that the Premier give the Labor Party rank and file members the opportunity to express an opinion about the decision that was made with so much dishonesty. If the Premier wants to restore the confidence in her government she should give the people of Queensland the opportunity to have a say--to have the say they should have had. If the Premier wants to restore that confidence, she needs to give the people of Queensland the opportunity that she denied them at the election. She went to an election without telling them of the plan. She went to the election without telling them that $15 billion of their assets were to be sold off. It is no wonder that the decision made so soon after the election has caused the anger that it has. That decision is never going to be considered properly by the people of Queensland simply because of the sneaky and underhanded way in which the decision was made. The decision itself is not the subject of this debate. It is a debate about honesty and integrity. It is clear from the government’s response tonight that it has no interest in addressing that dishonesty, it has no interest in redressing that lack of integrity. If it did it would, like us, be supporting the motion that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition as a first step in that process. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071267"></A>
Firstly, let me tell them about the national executive of the Australian Labor Party. This is a body elected by the party and is authorised to act in the best interests of the party. It is driven and motivated by a desire to put the party in the best position to campaign, develop policy and to put those policies to the Australian electorate. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The motion, as I understand it, that is before the national executive at its next meeting, a motion that is yet to be resolved or considered but which is before the national executive, is a motion that recognises that 2010--another revelation--is a federal election year. The motion acknowledges that in a federal election year the party will be on a campaign footing--no apologies, we are a political party and we are on a campaign footing in a federal election year. Do members opposite know why? Because we want to defeat Tony Abbott. Defeating Tony Abbott is the best thing that we can do for the working families of this country. Defeating Tony Abbott means putting an end to the denial of climate change. It means putting an end once and for all--we would have thought it happened in 2007, but no--to Work Choices, but it is creeping out of the coffin again. We will put an end to Work Choices completely. Tony Abbott was the architect of Work Choices, and the national executive of the Australian Labor Party will be putting all of its national resources, all of its effort, all of the time of the party available this year into defeating Tony Abbott. </Hansard-Body>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (7.30 pm): As I was saying, all of these elements are worth while, but I cannot help feeling what could have happened if only the government had taken the process one step further. This amendment bill only amends the three separate criminal history screening processes. It does not revolutionise them. It does not deliver a single streamlined approach to ensuring individuals with inappropriate criminal histories are prevented from working with our most vulnerable. There was an opportunity here to produce one system that had in-built flexibility to ensure the various sectors--be they child care, child protection, education, disability, health or policing--were all appropriately accommodated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075807"></A>
This amendment still relies on extensive cross government, cross agency communication. No matter how much a government can claim to operate within a whole-of-government approach, when you are dealing across layers of bureaucracy, when you are dealing with multiple criminal recordings, gaps will occur, mistakes will be made. Sure, this bill will reduce the likelihood of such to some extent but it could have achieved more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075808"></A>
Whilst I support the government’s bill, I am also disappointed it did not take the opportunity to strengthen the protection to our most vulnerable. It is clearly about the applicant--the individual requiring the criminal history check--and the government agencies that must undertake them. As commendable as this is, it is not about the children we are trying to protect or the adults with disabilities who need certainty and safety in their care. This is why I also support the shadow minister’s bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075809"></A>
The Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill would raise the bar with regards to criminal history screening for nonfamilial disability carers. It would implement an automatic disqualification from employment in such a role for someone with a criminal conviction or charge for a violent offence in the last seven years. Quite simply, people who have violent histories should not and will not be placed in a position of responsibility over vulnerable people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075810"></A>
The shadow minister has previously enunciated a range of cases that could have been prevented had this piece of legislation already been in place. In short, it is a necessary improvement to the protective system as it pertains to the care of adults with disabilities. As I said earlier, it is tragic that we must implement such a cumbersome and restrictive system on what is by far a predominantly law-abiding citizenry. It is my hope that both of the bills when passed will streamline and strengthen that system to make it less cumbersome and more effective in protecting the most vulnerable in our society. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (7.33 pm): I rise tonight to make a contribution to the cognate bills--the government’s Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the opposition’s Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill 2009, which was introduced by my colleague Andrew Cripps, the shadow minister for disability services and multicultural affairs. The purpose of this legislation is to reduce duplication and increase the consistency across the criminal history screening system, including education, disability services and child safety. I will be supporting the proposed amendments by the LNP which also seek to safeguard the wellbeing of disabled people who are placed in the care of an employed carer and to ensure that people with a violent criminal history are precluded from becoming a carer of a person with a disability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075815"></A>
Almost 18 months ago, my colleague Rosemary Menkens raised in parliament the issue of a carer with a non-conviction criminal history assaulting a person with a disability who was in his care. The Labor government took no action, and subsequently a private member’s bill was introduced into the parliament in October 2009 by the member for Hinchinbrook. The Bligh government has now introduced a mirror of the LNP bill which we believe is significantly overdue. The government’s bill, like the LNP’s bill, seeks to provide protection for people with disabilities, ensuring that they are not placed in the care of an employed carer with a violent criminal history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075817"></A>
Of particular interest to me are the amendments to the Nursing Act 1992, which provides the following exemptions in relation to the nursing profession whereby registered health practitioners, including nurses and midwives, will be automatically exempt from acquiring either card when they are providing services to children and adults with a disability as part of their professional duties. A person with a disability is in a position of vulnerability and must be able to trust their wellbeing to an employed carer. Both the LNP’s and the government’s bills seek to ensure that we are putting safeguards into legislation which seek to protect some of the most vulnerable members of our community. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (7.35 pm): As has been said, this is a cognate debate on the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill and the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. We support both bills. The opposition’s bill, as previous speakers from the opposition benches have said, was initiated by the member for Hinchinbrook. His actions were precipitated by a carer with a non-conviction criminal history assaulting a person with a disability who was in his care. The government’s lack of action led to the member’s response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075821"></A>
As has been said, the government has introduced this bill with its stated aim as being streamlining bureaucracy rather than protecting the vulnerable. The government claims that this is to reduce duplication and increase consistency across criminal history screening systems and make legislative amendments regarding short-term approvals for restrictive practices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075822"></A>
All I can say is ‘What’s past is prologue,’ which is a quote from <Hansard-Italic>
The Tempest</Hansard-Italic>
. The three medical related acts affected by this bill are the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act 1999, and I would also say that it does embrace the health practitioners act 2009, and I will explain why; the Nursing Act 2002; and the Coroners Act. Obviously the changes relating to the Coroners Act lie primarily in the area of law and justice so comments relating to that area need to be made in reference to largely non-medical issues. I will leave that to other speakers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075826"></A>
Registered medical practitioners have an automatic exemption from requiring a blue or yellow card when providing services to children or adults with a disability. I join with the member for Toowoomba North and his concerns for giving an automatic exemption to health professionals, and I will explain why. My concerns are specifically in reference to the amendment to the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act 1999 and I will refer my comments only to changes to this act and changes to relevant acts associated with it. I will leave it to other speakers to review those acts that are affected and that are in areas of their own personal interest or expertise.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075829"></A>
The critical issue that applies to medical practitioners is the change to section 384A(4) of the act, which relates to what must be recorded and the disciplinary matter, immediate suspension et cetera. The change to section 384A(5) will be--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075830"></A>
Subsection (6) applies if the children’s commissioner--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1075831"></A>
(a) 	requests further information about the disciplinary action, immediate suspension or section 311 action...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075832"></A>
A section 311 action, for those who may not know, is that section of the act under which the board--that being the Medical Board of Queensland--may take action on the basis of foreign law. In simple terms, this applies to a foreign registrant, who could be a naturalised citizen or other, where, one, the registrant’s registration, licence or certification under a foreign law relating to the registrant’s profession is suspended or cancelled for a reason relating to a matter for which disciplinary action could be taken under this act; or, two, conditions are imposed on the registrant’s registration, licence or certification under a foreign law relating to the registrant’s profession for a reason relating to a matter for which disciplinary action could be taken under this act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075834"></A>
Before becoming too overtly technical, this Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act is quite different to the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 in the following ways. The Commonwealth template legislation is not necessarily inclusive of these issues in their totality, but it could be argued that now there is a progression to the authority of the national board and, where applicable, their state or regional designate boards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075872"></A>
This then implies that reference to the sections in the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009--those sections being 135, 140, 144, 148, 150 and 151 of the Commonwealth template legislation--will have to apply either by default or by subordinate legislation. Sections 5 and 6 of the amendment to this bill in part mimic or closely replicate the exact words of the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act 1999 but enable the capacity of the children’s commissioner to have written notice of all types of potential offences that I have previously detailed--that is, disciplinary action, immediate suspension, section 311 actions and all other issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075874"></A>
Before moving to those issues, I put it to the health minister, the Attorney-General, the Premier and the Solicitor-General that I see a weakness that becomes immediately apparent. I suspect it is a gap, but I think it is more than a technical one and I believe it may be utilised by an astute but potentially dangerous offender--in this case, a medical professional--who may seek to use the transition from state to federal responsibility as an issue of denial of authority effectively, because there are no retrospective clauses or even possibly a choice not to be inclusive of a specific series of amendments to the new health practitioners act--that is, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075877"></A>
This act is really an agreement between health ministers. I am quite happy to stand corrected, but I would be concerned even if the High Court eventually upheld the right of the Commonwealth law to be applied. In that time delay an offender might be able to continue offending or escape justice in the most extreme case, or in the most minor case deter appropriate judicial authority from promptly dealing with that situation. In this situation, the children’s commissioner might be delayed in being correctly and promptly informed to prevent the offence on the vulnerable individual. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075878"></A>
The critical reason is that the Commonwealth has no legislative authority currently in this area of health. I must ask that these matters be carefully considered and no superficial decision be made, as we have seen in the past how very determined offenders have wreaked such havoc on our systems by evading boards which fail miserably to protect the public interest when the demands of government for urgently available professional medical staff were placed ahead of proper due diligence on the alleged offenders. I say this because googling certain people discovered medical offenders and then immediately raised concerns when the board’s more extended due diligence allegedly found no improper behaviour orders against the practitioners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075879"></A>
The next issue I would like to raise in the amendment to the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act 1999 is raised in sections 7 and 8 of the same clause--clause 217. I would merely like to highlight that the draft changes seek to protect the identity of the child. Secondly, the board gives the children’s commissioner information about disciplinary action, suspension or whether it is set aside on appeal--this is a very important change--and, one, that the act, action or suspension has been set aside and, two, the reasons given by the entity that set aside the action or suspension and the reasons for setting it aside. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075881"></A>
Interestingly, in the <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 there were quite a few issues raised, but this one obviously was not raised. I think it should have been, but possibly it was overlooked because of the detail. It does raise issues of denial of natural justice and restriction of rights and liberties. It is for that very reason that I have to endorse and praise the actions of the member for Hinchinbrook, whose approach in his private member’s bill was to clearly annunciate that the benefit of the doubt must rest in favour of the vulnerable. If the law cannot or will not protect these people, then change it so it can. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075882"></A>
As I say, I support both bills and would ask that they both be supported in a bipartisan approach. I have raised issues that I believe will upset some of those who considered that the Commonwealth template--that is, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act--was not really included in it and in fact is not discussed. But, in fact, I believe it is drawn into it. It is not through fear that the law will not apply. It is the potential for delay where harm may occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075884"></A>
State health ministers might be fooling themselves if they believe new boards will be utterly compliant with their wishes. Whilst the minister retains the authority to overrule boards, it is not specified when and where those reserve powers may be used. I raised this issue in my speech in this House on 28 October 2009. Interestingly, in the changes New South Wales has opted out and has opted to control its own complaints handling, investigation and review mechanisms. Some felt that this would enable some people to escape to New South Wales and avoid detection. Equally, it may beef up its due diligence and identify and report those people to the children’s commissioner, as is the case with this bill. It may follow, then, that all investigation of medical practitioners might eventually drift towards New South Wales. We could have avoided the cost here, but I doubt we will. I think that it will only amplify the cost. As it is a user or service entity pays system, I think it may well do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075885"></A>
This then leads to the very difficult issue of mandatory reporting and all that would seem to stem from it by the act that has come about. This criminal screening act seems to raise issues where it may well apply. Just as was raised when the new bill last year--that is, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009--was proclaimed, opposition members spoke clearly about the consequences and the varied types of consequences when you have mandatory reporting. I think what was said, in summary, was that all sorts of people who never thought they would be drawn into this now will be. Many will refuse to report. I guess we are potentially going to see the consequences of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075886"></A>
In an interjection to my speech, the minister said that doctors should not be treated any differently. Unfortunately, with this type of act that follows, and which I believe links in, I believe the potential problems that we raised will come about. I think we are going to have to wait and see. There is a lovely saying that parents teach their children in childhood the consequences of their actions. Indeed, it is the wise and prudent who always think things through. There is that wonderful quote from <Hansard-Italic>
Romeo and Juliet</Hansard-Italic>
 that said, ‘A plague on both your houses,’ which is what happens when you institute laws that come back to bite you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075887"></A>
In simple terms what I have been trying to say is that this bill relies on comparable screening standards and timing of the behaviour of relevant boards. In this case I am discussing the Medical Board. I believe the assumption is flawed. I say this because currently in Health there is a transition to both a national board and a review mechanism. In New South Wales that mechanism is slightly different. A new health practitioner has come about to implement this. I see institutional weaknesses that may lead to potential gaps that do not appear to have been raised and certainly have not raised alarms where I think they should have. I believe there is clear evidence on past experience and that it has necessitated us to move to a national board of registration and certainly a review of these health acts. Furthermore, health may be more complex for a system that is seeking to simplify procedures and that may have been believed. That was why I endorsed the comments of the former Attorney-General and member for Toowoomba North. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075889"></A>
I have discussed with the shadow minister what I have raised, and closely reviewed the acts and all the relevant literature associated with them. My recommendation is that medical practitioners be excluded from this process until the issue is clarified. It is not exclusion so as to treat them as higher bodies but represents a more powerful approach to dealing with a group with clearly a greater power and open access to vulnerable people. I will be writing to the health minister with my concerns. We support the intent of the bill. I personally see no other major issues in my more superficial overview of the other areas. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (7.48 pm): It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in support of the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill. The Bligh government is committed to providing children with a safe and loving home environment and protecting them from harm or neglect. To help make sure our children are safe, it is necessary to undertake criminal history checks on people working with children. In Queensland there are multiple screening regimes in place including the blue card system. This bill will reduce the duplication of criminal history checks. At the same time it will maintain the stringent controls that protect our children. It will do this by linking existing screening systems to avoid multiple criminal history checks being undertaken. The number of screenings will be reduced by around 100,000 in the first three years of implementation. This system will be simpler to understand. If you work with children you need a blue card unless you qualify for an exemption</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075923"></A>
Child safety officers will also now be screened under the blue card system rather than the department’s screening system. The bill also has some practical benefits for both sides of my portfolio--Sport and Child Safety. For sporting clubs, it will get volunteers on the ground sooner--and we can only hope that we will get more sports coaches, managers and the like. For example, if police officers or teachers want to work at their local sporting club, a criminal history check may not need to be conducted as it has already been done for them to undertake their professional duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075927"></A>
This is also the case for people who would like to become foster or kinship carers. Carers may be able to provide a safe and loving home for our children sooner because screening will not be duplicated. However, we will maintain the checks and balances that mean that our carers go through an extensive screening and training process before being approved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075928"></A>
Aside from criminal history screening, the assessment and approval process involves a household safety study, a health and wellbeing questionnaire and medical checks, if required. We have one of the most stringent child protection systems in the country, and the commission has reported that 98 per cent of children in care in Queensland feel safe. Tonight when we pass this legislation, hopefully it will increase the number of potential foster and kinship carers and also increase the number of volunteers at local sporting clubs. I commend the bill to the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075931"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms JOHNSTONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Townsville--ALP) (7.50 pm): I am pleased to rise tonight to participate in this cognate debate. The Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill allows a number of changes that will provide protection to two groups needing special protection in Queensland--children and people with a disability. The amendments will also provide a number of benefits to our community. The obvious intention of changes to criminal history screening is to maintain rigorous protections for these vulnerable groups. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075933"></A>
In addition to these fundamental protections, the proposed changes also mean that registered teachers and police officers will be able to apply for exemptions from holding a blue card as they have been screened to undertake their professional duties. This will save them the cost of a blue card application. Exemptions will be provided at no cost to teachers or police officers. Exemptions will last as long as the person remains a registered teacher or police officer or while their blue card remains current.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075934"></A>
Blue card holders will be able to apply for an exemption from holding a yellow card. Exemptions will be provided at no cost to the blue card holders. I currently hold both a blue and yellow card. This is because an organisation I was employed by did work with both children and people with a disability. Consequently, I was required to obtain both cards as a condition of my employment. This was a duplication of administrative tasks for both my employer and those administering the requirements of the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian and the Disability Services Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075936"></A>
The exemption notice process will enable individuals to transition easily between systems and begin working or volunteering immediately on the basis of their previous criminal history check. It will also increase the pool of people readily available to be volunteers or to work with children with a disability. The exemption notice process will simplify and streamline administrative processes for organisations and individuals, and this is important because we all know the importance of having our dollars at the front line instead of in the back-of-house area in administration. These amendments will actually allow that important front-line work to continue. As has been said by the previous speaker, the number of screenings is anticipated to be reduced by about 100,000 in the first three years of implementation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075939"></A>
It is important to remember that this bill reduces duplication while maintaining scrutiny, protection and safeguards for our children. Student teachers must obtain a blue card to undertake their teaching practicum, and this is provided free of charge. They will now obtain a saving when applying for their teacher registration by paying an administration fee which is half the cost of the regular criminal history check fee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075940"></A>
The blue card renewal period will be extended from two to three years, with a reduction in the per annum costs, and the yellow card renewal period will also increase to three years. I feel comfortable with this extension of time given that the children’s commission has systems in place which allow for daily updates from the Queensland Police Service on changes to an individual’s police information. This means that if a person does not comply with the conditions of holding a blue card and notifies the commission of any changes to their personal police information, the commission will still receive this information daily and be in a position to maintain the protection of our young people and people with disabilities. In conclusion, the system is simpler to understand: if you work with children you need a blue card unless you qualify for an exemption. I commend the government bill to the House.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (7.54 pm): I rise to add to the cognate debate on the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill introduced by the member for Hinchinbrook and the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I intend to focus my comments on the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. The proposed amendments seek to ensure the wellbeing of people with disabilities placed in the care of an employed carer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075948"></A>
Under this bill, a violent criminal history would preclude employment or necessitate consideration by the chief executive. A history including convictions would disqualify a person from employment as a carer while a history of violent charges without conviction, such as repeated charges of domestic violence, would be assessed by the chief executive. I remind the House that a right to request review of a decision made by the chief executive is included. As the member for Hinchinbrook has stated, the current legislation does not preclude the employment of someone with a violent criminal history from being a carer for a person with a disability, and that is a risk that is not worth taking.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075949"></A>
In consideration of the aspects of this bill, I took the time to speak with a Coomera constituent who, in my view, is abundantly experienced with regard to the issue of caring for those who suffer a disability. My constituent has an associate degree in social science with regard to disability. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, this person has provided care for two now-adult children, both of who suffer quite serious disabilities. For the past 28 or so years this person has been the principal carer of these children and chose to study in this area to both help her to better care for her children and allow her to work within the industry and care for others as a paid carer. As I said, this individual is abundantly experienced to comment on the bill before us. Among other things, my constituent was adamant that the need to protect those suffering a disability from the risk of harm at the hands of carers is paramount. Indeed, the view expressed was best summed up by this statement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075951"></A>
It is so important to protect the marginalised in our community at the outset. It is not good enough that we run the risk of putting these people in harm’s way when we have the capacity to avert that risk.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075952"></A>
Currently, that certainly is not the case. Some people with disabilities have anger issues themselves. So, as my constituent said, if in those circumstances the carer has a predisposition to violence then one feeds off the other. Even the most balanced person would be challenged at times by a disabled person with anger issues. It follows that a carer with known anger issues should not be a carer. It is recognised that not everyone with a predisposition to aggression would have a history that is on the record, but where there is a record then that record should be used to protect those vulnerable people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075953"></A>
I want to make one final comment--a suggestion, if you like. I put it to the government that there is an anomaly in the system that puts bona fide disability workers at a disadvantage. My understanding is that if a worker leaves employment then they lose the right to retain their blue card. Once a new sponsoring employer is found, a reapplication for a blue card can proceed. Once the application has been receipted, the employee can commence employment. I am told that that is where the problem occurs. It can take some weeks for the process to arrive at the receipting point. I put it to the government that this, too, could be streamlined. Where a worker has accreditation in the industry, retention of the blue card would help employment prospects. If deemed necessary, employers could have access to a central database that confirms the current qualifications of the prospective employee. It has been made clear that we support the government bill, and I call on those opposite to see the sense of the private member’s bill and to support it through the House also.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (7.59 pm): May I add my welcome. The Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill 2009 was introduced into the House by the shadow minister for disability services and multicultural affairs, the honourable member for Hinchinbrook, on 7 October 2009. The honourable Minister for Community Services and Housing introduced the government’s Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill on 9 February 2009, the first sitting day of this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080219"></A>
In rising to speak in this cognate debate of the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill and the private member’s bill from the LNP, the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill, it would be remiss of me not to mention that the government’s bill is yet another example of Labor playing catch-up to the opposition. Mind you, if that means we get better laws to protect vulnerable Queenslanders then we are happy to have prompted the creation of this bill. Frequently in this place we witness Labor exposed by the LNP for its laziness as it scrambles to rejig and improve upon our policy and bills with legislation of its own. As honourable members have heard, the LNP will be supporting the government’s bill, along with our own, albeit with some reservations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080220"></A>
Positive aspects aside, to bring this bill forward on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 with less than 24 hours warning and then squeezing in a briefing before parliament sat yesterday morning is something of a slap in the face to those affected by the legislation, not to mention the non-government members of parliament. However, I would like to thank the staff from the various departments for attending the rushed briefing and for answering questions to the best of their capabilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080221"></A>
The Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill, which runs to some 500-plus pages, makes changes to some 17 acts and others which are found in schedule 3. I turn first to the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill 2009 and congratulate the shadow minister on bringing this bill before us. We on this side of the House respect and understand the need for people with disabilities to maintain as much independence as they possibly can, with or without carers. People with disabilities are among the most vulnerable and isolated members of our community, which is why the position of a carer is one that should exemplify absolute trust. The proposed amendments seek to help protect people with a disability from being put in the care of someone who has a history of violence or abuse and be free from maltreatment or cruelty. As the shadow minister so clearly opined in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1080223"></A>
There should be no question marks over the safety of the relationship between a carer and a person receiving that care. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080224"></A>
Therefore, people with a background of violence and abusive behaviour should be disqualified from providing care to a vulnerable person, such as a person with a disability. Disabilities can be permanent or temporary and affect the young and the old. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that about one in five Australians is affected by some form of disability. Notably, the Australian population is changing, with older age groups making up an increasing proportion of the population. Maturing baby boomers have been signalled as a major financial challenge for the federal government, which is no doubt behind federal Labor’s decision to raise the working age to 67. Older populations and increasing life expectancies will create more people with disabilities and an associated increased demand for carers to look after them. Many unpaid family carers will simply become too worn out to adequately manage the care of their loved ones without assistance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080226"></A>
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in its 2009 report found that the number of people with the highest level of disability is projected to increase from 1.2 million to 2.3 million within the next two decades. It would follow that the number of carers will also need to rise to accommodate this doubling in the number of people with special needs. Disabilities also occur in varying degrees. Many people with disabilities require intensive ongoing care and support from others because they cannot meet their own basic daily needs. For that reason a carer is required to help those people to survive on a daily basis and maintain their dignity and their respect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080227"></A>
In the main, carers are people with noble intentions who give much of themselves to improve the lives of people with disabilities. However, there are exceptions, and this bill would prohibit someone convicted of a violent offence from being engaged in a paid position as a carer for a person with a disability. People with a history of committing violent offences would be referred to the chief executive of the Department of Communities for consideration as to their suitability to be a carer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080231"></A>
Organisations such as Teenage Adventure Camps--Queensland, TAC-Q, are a prime example of the wonderful and exceptional people in our community who offer their time and services to care for and support people with disabilities. TAC-Q is a charity that runs an annual camp in Currumbin for teenagers suffering from life-threatening illnesses. The generosity of all involved in this adventure filled week--from theme park operators to people offering Harley rides, the Rocks Resort and the kind, big hearted volunteers--is to be commended. Tales are recounted at the farewell dinner on the last Sunday night of the camp and there is not a dry eye in the place--lots of laughter, happy moments, challenges overcome and, above all, love. Camps and carers provide these teenagers with the experience of living with their peers, establishing friendships and the realisation that they are not alone with their misfortunes. Teenagers are challenged, inspired and motivated to participate in a range of unforgettable activities and leave with a new-found confidence and outlook on life. Of course, that is made possible only through the dedication of the volunteer careers who devote themselves to this worthy cause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080233"></A>
Initiatives such as the LNP’s carer’s charter were designed to ensure that the value of carers is recognised in our legislation. Unfortunately, this charter of rights has not been transformed into legislation by the current government. Undoubtedly, the majority of carers perform their duties with great dedication and compassion. Unfortunately, there is a minority who violate the implicit terms of this relationship and it is those people who prey on the vulnerabilities of people with disabilities. That is why it is so necessary for the state government to provide the necessary protection and to support this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080234"></A>
History reveals that the Queensland government has failed to protect the vulnerabilities of people with disabilities in recent years. The Bribie Island Care Independent Living Association facility is one prime example, where a federal parliamentary committee in 2004 was told that residents were forced to have cold showers, have chillies put into their mouths, were deprived of sleep and food, were hit with broom handles, had head lice infestations treated with flyspray and were tied to chairs and toilet seats. The Adult Guardian in Queensland also investigated the Bribie Island facility. Their findings tell of a staff culture within the facility where disabled people were blamed for their behaviour and unfair punishment was doled out. Despite the fact that both of these findings occurred in 2004, it is only quite recently that several former carers at that facility have been brought to justice and I understand that others are still awaiting trial. In addition to those instances, police were called to investigate claims that people with disabilities were being abused and neglected by staff at a community support service at several day-care and accommodation facilities in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080238"></A>
When looking at the latest statistics provided by the Department of Communities we see that, while infrequent, abuse by carers is a real issue in the community. The report shows that there were 27 complaints of alleged official misconduct by departmental workers servicing people with disabilities in Queensland. Of those matters, seven related to assault, six related to criminal misconduct, 12 were for inappropriate behaviour and two related to mismanagement. These figures relate to government service providers alone. Figures that will include non-government service providers would push these sad statistics even higher. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080240"></A>
Additional findings from a report conducted by the National People with Disabilities and Carer Council titled <Hansard-Italic>
Shut out: the experience of people with disabilities and their families in Australia</Hansard-Italic>
, a national disabilities strategy consultation report, show us that one of the main areas of concern voiced among people with disabilities, their carers, family members and service providers was the abuse of children with disabilities in institutional settings, including respite services. This bill adds a much-needed layer of protection for all people with disabilities who require paid care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080242"></A>
I move now to the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill which, as I mentioned before, makes amendments to some 17 acts and several others in schedule 3. The explanatory notes inform us that the policy objectives are to effectively reduce duplication and increase consistency across criminal history screening systems. Currently in Queensland there are multiple criminal history screening regimes in place. These include the blue card system, which requires a person in child regulated employment to undergo a criminal history screening, and the yellow card system, which requires all persons engaged at service outlets of funded non-government disability service providers to undergo criminal history screening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080243"></A>
The provisions of this bill will allow for police officers and registered teachers to apply for an exemption from holding a blue card when they are providing child regulated services that fall outside their professional duties. Blue card holders will be able to apply for exemptions from holding a yellow card and registered health practitioners, including nurses and midwives, will be automatically exempt from requiring either of these cards whilst providing services to children and also when providing services to adults with a disability as part of their professional duties. Different legislative systems of the blue card, yellow card and teacher registration will be retained but will need to be aligned in order to examine the same types of police information. The only way to achieve that is through amended legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084237"></A>
Yellow cards will now attract the new fee of some $70. Departmental staff told us that the money is to be allocated to reimburse the NGOs which will have to apply and purchase cards for staff. As this is earmarked for the 2010-11 budget, concerns have been raised that this could place added stress on already stretched NGOs to come up with the money for their staff should there be an interim period between when provisions in the bill are enacted and the budget allocation becomes available. Perhaps the minister could address this in the reply or in consideration. Volunteers will remain exempt from paying a fee under both systems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084238"></A>
The minister boasts that Queensland’s blue card system is regarded as one of the most effective and accountable screening systems in Australia, yet this government refuses to make it even better. It voted down the opposition’s 2008 amendment that would have added photo ID to new and renewed cards stating it was too costly. While cost effectiveness is an important consideration, one cannot place too high a price on the personal safety of society’s most vulnerable group: children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084239"></A>
As the new processes go through the installation phases, various computer systems will have to be linked together. Yesterday’s briefing informed us that duplications will be removed or erased in this manner. A number of agencies are involved here. There is Police, Education, Disabilities, Child Safety, Health and Communities, if not more. This Bligh government has a shocking track record of successfully linking computer systems. Deadlines have not been met in the past and many millions of dollars have been wasted. The task of interfacing existing systems with other agencies is guaranteed to be difficult and I am keen to know what time lines the minister is working towards. Will it be this year or next or the one after? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084240"></A>
I would also like to know how long before the streamlining and linkage to other agencies is complete and what guarantee can be given that information will be correctly processed. How many unfortunate glitches that see vulnerable children and adults fall through the cracks will there be, such as we saw in the transition of the ICMS child safety system? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084241"></A>
At yesterday’s briefing the member for Gladstone asked whether people wishing to enter into surrogacy arrangements would have any criminal screening. The reply to this was no, they would not. COAG currently has an agreement with regard to children for a greater sharing of information between states. Living on the border of New South Wales and Queensland, I can attest to the benefits for those of us living in this region to have more cross-border friendly laws. This legislation also makes changes to restrictive practices which are required at times to manage testing behaviours. As a result of the 2006 Carter report, <Hansard-Italic>
Challenging behaviour and disability: A targeted response</Hansard-Italic>
, legislation was brought in to introduce a scheme on 1 July 2008 that was aimed at reducing restrictive practices. There is currently a period of three months for short-term approvals to be able to be given. To date these could only be extended in exceptional circumstances. This legislation will extend the maximum period for short-term approvals for a further three months. Apparently it has been difficult for some disability service providers to have enough time to prepare a proper assessment for the adult and to develop the positive behaviour support plan that is a central part of this scheme. The shadow minister has already outlined his concerns with this amendment and I look forward to hearing the minister’s reply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084242"></A>
The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s report No.2 of 2010 found that a large number of clauses may affect the rights and liberties of individuals and, in particular, employment related rights and information privacy. The government does not see any significant costs with this legislation. However, as I have said, the past record with computer systems, especially when attempting to link agencies, has been very poor. In short, the legislation has significant merit. It aims to reduce duplication and increase consistency across criminal history screening systems. However, it does not offer the level of protection to people with disabilities that the LNP’s bill does. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084243"></A>
I would like to place on record my enormous respect and gratitude to all of those who have chosen to care for another, whether in a paid or an unpaid capacity. We should all spend a day, or three, walking in their shoes.</Hansard-Body>

Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (8.14 pm): I rise to speak in the cognate debate on the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The overwhelming majority of employees and volunteers in the sector which we are speaking about tonight provide exemplary service to the community. The vast majority of these people are both professional and caring and perform their roles with diligence and humility. These individuals and their service provider employees ensure that those in the community who need their assistance are on the whole very well provided for. They face many challenges and difficult circumstances in their day-to-day roles and are often constrained by limited resources but nevertheless do a marvellous job. That is why it is so important to protect these sectors and their clients with appropriate systems, checks and balances, regulations and, today, legislation to ensure the continued intrinsic goodwill of the word ‘carer’ and to guard their clients from harm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084246"></A>
My first comments are in respect to the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill. Whilst I am supportive of the thrust of this piece of legislation proposed by the government, it could be seen as being more about the reduction of duplication and about increasing consistency across the entire criminal history screening process rather than an intent to protect those who are vulnerable. The main objective of the bill is to reduce duplication by providing exemptions relating to police officers, teachers, current blue card holders and registered health care practitioners when they are providing services to children as well as adults with a disability as part of their professional duties. It also aims to increase consistency in criminal history screening by amalgamating into the blue card system screening of all persons providing services to children with a disability, all employees and volunteers of state government entities who are engaged in child related roles, health students undertaking placements that involve service delivery of children within private or public facilities and all employees and volunteers of local governments undertaking child related roles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084247"></A>
The system seems to be unnecessarily complex at present. For example, the teacher screening procedures do not exempt teachers from requiring a blue card and individuals with a blue card are still subject to the teacher screening process if they are applying to become a teacher. A further example of this complicated web is an individual providing services to a child with disabilities in a non-funded organisation that is not screened under the yellow card system but under the blue card system. As such, there are duplications, inconsistencies and unnecessary costs that are experienced by both organisations and individuals. It is these costs that I am concerned about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084248"></A>
Whilst I welcome the move to improve criminal history screening, I have concerns relating to the costs in the government’s bill where employees may be required to pay to obtain and maintain their own cards in order to secure or maintain employment in the sector. On commencement of the blue card system in 2001 the cost of a blue card was $40. Today it is $61.75. Under this bill it jumps again to $70. The fee to replace a card is now $10.30. A yellow card, the cost of which was previously borne by the government, will now hit the applicant for the same cost of a blue card, increasing to $70. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084249"></A>
I see from the minister’s second reading speech in relation to costs that the Bligh government will be assisting the funded non-government disability services sector in relation to the changes. I understand that there was mention of increased recurrent funding for community organisations at a briefing yesterday morning, but I still hold reservations, as do many organisations in the sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084250"></A>
In relation to this I would like to quote from National Disability Services, the peak representative body for more than 600 non-government disability services throughout Australia--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1084251"></A>
The disability sector already has an array of financial and administrative imposts associated with compliance that are beyond those experienced in any other state. The additional burden the proposed changes represent is likely to compromise viability for some services and is considered unreasonable. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1084252"></A>
Overall, it is the view of our members that the proposed changes represent administrative efficiencies for government but represent an increase in administrative, monitoring and financial impost for non government disability service providers. There is also concern that these changes will disadvantage low income (predominantly female) workers, and specifically disadvantage people with disability (or families) who manage their own funding, or live in Indigenous communities where the labour market is tight. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088444"></A>
We need to ensure that the government’s proposals do not compromise the great work and viability of service providers and individuals. We need to be enabling these organisations, not imposing more paperwork as they manage their workforce of carers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088451"></A>
I acknowledge that this bill is not specifically targeted at the disability sector. It also seeks to reduce duplication and increase consistency across the criminal history screening system, including Education, Disability Services and Child Safety. The legislation will affect health professionals, police involved in child regulated duties and volunteers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084292"></A>
I would like to briefly touch on short-term approvals in relation to restrictive practices. Amendments were made to the Disability Services Act in 2008 to regulate their use and mandate positive behaviour support following the report by Justice Carter. Under current arrangements, a short-term approval provides up to three months of the development of a behaviour management plan for an individual who exhibits challenging behaviour. The amendment extends this period to six months. According to the explanatory notes, this extension is warranted as service providers are having difficulty with completing these requirements in the current three-month period. We are a little concerned by this extension and I sympathise with service providers who face the challenges of developing the plans in light of the scarce resources that they have at their disposal. I note that the government has not allocated funds to service providers to implement the Carter recommendations and I wonder whether appropriate investment might have solved this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084295"></A>
The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee noted that a large number of clauses may affect the rights and liberties of individuals and, in particular, rights to employment and information privacy. However, in my opinion those potential breaches are justified for the safety of children and those with a disability from risk of harm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084296"></A>
I would now like to make some comments on the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill, which I do support. Only 18 months ago, the then shadow minister for social inclusion and member for Burdekin, Rosemary Menkens, raised the issue of a carer with a non-conviction criminal history assaulting a person with a disability who was in his care. Due to government inaction to address the matter of inadequate criminal history screening for carers at that time, this private member’s bill was introduced in October 2009 by the shadow minister for disability services and member for Hinchinbrook, Andrew Cripps. The foremost principle in disability services should be the interests of the person with the disability and the environment in which he or she lives. One of the key planks of government policy on disability services should be the identification, prevention and early intervention in situations where those with a disability are endangered, and that is what this legislation seeks to do by protecting those most vulnerable people in our society through ensuring that those who care for them in a non-familial capacity do not have histories of violent behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084297"></A>
All forms of violence are abhorrent to this community, including physical, sexual and emotional violence, and to have a carer with a history of such behaviour jeopardises the health and wellbeing of those for which they purport to care. The objectives of this bill include an automatic disqualification from employment in a carer’s role for someone with a criminal conviction or charge for a violent offence in the past years. Those charges can cover examples such as domestic violence charges that are not followed through the court processes. A history of charges without conviction would be at the discretion of the chief executive. It is important to note that the bill does not preclude individuals with criminal histories from being employed in the sector, only from working in the role of a carer of a person with a disability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084298"></A>
It is a shame that the government is not prepared to support the bill that seeks to afford vulnerable people much more protection than does its contribution. We make no bones about the fact that our bill is much more stringent than the one proposed by the government because we want to ensure that this community is as secure as it can be from those who seek to damage the marvellous record of our carers and place them in jeopardy. Australia has almost 2.6 million carers and nearly 500,000 of those are primary carers. Carers provide care and support to family members and friends with a disability, mental illness, chronic conditions, terminal illness or those who are frail aged. It is appropriate that legal safeguards are employed and strengthened to protect the rights of those with a disability and also to protect those carers who do the right thing in providing exemplary care to their clients. People with disabilities are valued members of our community and should be respected and cared for in a nonthreatening and violence-free environment. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP) (8.24 pm): It is a great pleasure to rise in support of the bill that is currently before the House. I congratulate the minister for her initiative in improving the safety and lives of the children and the most vulnerable in the state of Queensland. The legislation before the House will reduce, particularly for registered teachers and police, the red tape surrounding criminal screening for people working with children and people with disabilities. This will save time, money and resources. I think it is a very important initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084301"></A>
The bill will reduce the duplication of criminal history checks undertaken in Queensland for people seeking to work or volunteer with children and increase the consistency of criminal history screening processes to enable exemptions to operate across the systems. In any employment screening, it is important to keep focus on the context environment in which a person may pose a risk. Accordingly, separate specialist screening systems are being maintained, but they are being effectively linked to reduce duplication. The bill will improve the cohesion of the blue card, teacher registration and yellow card systems to allow for exemptions to operate across systems, while also improving essential safeguards for children and people with a disability. The amendments will simplify and streamline processes for community members seeking to work or volunteer with children and will ensure that no gaps are created when people move from one system to another. The bill is evidence that the government is continually finding new ways to improve service delivery by simplifying and streamlining processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084302"></A>
This evening I particularly want to talk about some of the aspects of the changes that are reportedly going to affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants. It is important to remember that the bill will not significantly alter the requirements for the blue card. The focus is on reducing duplication. Of the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants to provide foster or kinship care or be employed as licensed care providers, 88.94 per cent resulted in the issue of a positive notice, only 1.4 per cent of applicants resulted in a negative notice and 9.17 per cent of applications were withdrawn because additional information was not received. Therefore, it is an important focus of the bill that those people are not going to be adversely affected, as some people have alleged. That is simply not the case, because most of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants are blue card applicants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084303"></A>
The children’s commission is very active in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in my electorate. It distributes a range of information to advise on who requires a blue card, makes available resources to help applicants meet the identification requirements and advises people that, in most cases, a criminal history does not prevent a person from applying for a blue card. I wanted to put that on the record to allay the fears that have been raised. I commend the bill that is before the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084305"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (8.27 pm): I am proud to rise to take part in this cognate debate. Specifically I want to refer to the benefits for teachers. Currently registered teachers do not require a blue card when undertaking their professional duties. However, teachers often work with children outside of the domain of their professional duties by volunteering in local sporting clubs or community organisations. To do this they currently need to obtain a blue card. It is estimated that there may be 31,500 teachers who currently hold blue cards. Under the amendments, registered teachers will be able to apply for an exemption and immediately commence work or volunteer with children in child regulated services in the blue card context outside of their professional duties, for example, to volunteer at a local sporting club. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian will verify the person’s status as a registered teacher with the Queensland College of Teachers and a duplicate criminal history check will not be undertaken unless the person has a criminal history that requires further consideration to operate unconditionally across the variety of service environments in which a blue card can be used. For example, a teacher with conditions attached to their registration may further require assessment in the blue card context to ensure safeguards for children are maintained. Once a registered teacher obtains an exemption notice, they do not need to apply for renewal. The exemption notice remains current for the duration of their teacher registration unless cancelled earlier. Given that the screening of teachers in the teacher registration process is broadly comparable to that undertaken in the blue card system, including registered teachers, the exemption notice regime is an efficient way to reduce the duplication of criminal history screening. </Hansard-Body>

In addition, student teachers must obtain a blue card to undertake their teaching practicum and this is provided free of charge. They will now obtain a saving when applying for their teacher registration by paying an administration fee that is half the cost of the regular criminal history fee. A duplicate criminal history check will not be undertaken unless further assessment is required about a person’s a suitability to teach. I support the bill. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (8.29 pm): I am pleased to speak on the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill tonight. The blue card system has three critical elements. The first is a requirement for regulated organisations to implement risk management strategies to mitigate risks of harm to children. The commissioner works in partnership with organisations to achieve improved safeguards for children. In 2008-09 the commission engaged with over 266,000 people to educate stakeholders about the blue card system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088579"></A>
The second element is a requirement for regulated organisations to ensure that individuals providing services to children undergo a blue card check, which prevents high-risk individuals from providing services to children. Since its inception, over 3,500 high-risk individuals have been prevented from providing services to children. Of these, almost 1,900 people have been excluded from holding a blue card and almost 1,500 people have withdrawn their application after being challenged on their criminal history. This number of withdrawals is indicative of the strong deterrent effect of the blue card check. It is very likely that a significant number of other high-risk individuals are deterred from applying altogether because of the reputation of the system in identifying and challenging them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088580"></A>
The third element is that of monitoring the criminal histories of over 478,000 blue card holders and the levels of compliance by regulated organisations with risk management and blue card requirements. Since its inception, nearly 350 people have had their blue card suspended as a result of a change in their criminal history. A strong indicator of the effectiveness of the blue card system is the community’s acceptance and support, which is reflected in the 2008-09 client satisfaction survey conducted by the Office of Economic and Statistical Research. The majority of respondents--77 per cent, in fact--in the survey believed that the blue card system is an effective initiative which assists in creating safe and supportive environments for children and young people in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088582"></A>
The effectiveness of the blue card system will be further strengthened by increasing the commission’s access to certain information relating to a person’s police information and by broadening the exclusionary framework to automatically disqualify persons who are subject to sexual offender orders under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. A sexual offender order is made when a person has been convicted of a serious sexual offence and when a court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the person is a serious danger to the community in the absence of such an order being made. A person subject to a sexual offender order will be banned from being able to apply for a blue card. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088584"></A>
The system will also be strengthened by the introduction of the new mandatory validation process, which will require an individual’s blue card or exemption notice to be validated by an employer. This will enable the commission to be advised of up-to-date employer details. It is important for the commission to have up-to-date employer details so that all relevant employers can be informed of changes to the status of a person’s blue card or exemption notice. This additional safeguard will significantly strengthen the effectiveness of the blue card system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088585"></A>
The commission’s access to criminal history information will be increased by amendments enabling certain information to be requested from the Mental Health Court, the Mental Health Review Tribunal and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It makes sense, therefore, to reduce duplication by amalgamating the screening for people who work in regulated child related environments under the blue card system and exempting those already screened under another comparative system. This presents a simplified child related employment-screening system which is robust and consistent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088588"></A>
The success of the blue card system has ensured that those who work with our children are of a high character. Parents can be confident that their children are in safe hands when they join a sporting club, nippers, little athletics, scouts, girl guides, church youth groups or whatever the group may be, and our service providers such as police, teachers and health workers have all undergone criminal history checks. This legislation will cut out unnecessary duplication. It will also ensure that those who work with people with disabilities and all state and local government workers whose positions include working with children and young people will come under the system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088589"></A>
The period covered will also increase from two to three years. These measures will increase the efficiency of the blue card system and streamline the application process. I thank the commissioner as well as the office of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian for their efforts, the minister, the Hon. Karen Struthers, and all involved in the preparation of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundaberg--LNP) (8.35 pm): It is indeed a great privilege to be able to speak in favour of the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment 2009 before the House. As all members of parliament representing the different political parties and different areas know, we are here to serve and help our constituents. How we help the most vulnerable people in our society is a reflection on this parliament, on each member and on the community they serve. It is great to see any bill before the House that assists those most vulnerable people in the community. In saying that, we have to make sure that the bills are drafted in such a way as to reduce the administrative burden on society. I would like to thank the minister for easing the burden in relation to how the different acts are administered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088594"></A>
The protection of vulnerable groups within our community should always be at the forefront of the minds of members of this parliament. This bill provides protection for people who remain amongst the most vulnerable in our society. Our disabled citizens rely on carers to varying degrees. Some just need help occasionally with odds and ends, while others need intensive care to perform what able-bodied people would consider the simplest of tasks. Whatever their situation, disabled people in our society deserve to be treated with love and respect. Those who require intensive care should feel safe with their carer at all times. A carer is placed in a position of trust as they look after someone who is completely reliant on them to perform essential daily tasks. It is one of the most honourable roles someone can take on--one that cannot be done lightly and one where we must maintain standards so the disabled in our community receive the best care possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088595"></A>
Carers truly are people whom we should all admire and thank whenever possible, because their hard work and valuable contribution to our communities is immense. While the majority of carers are giving of their time, skills and assistance for the right reasons, a very small minority are not. A carer who abuses this trust in any way is among the most despicable of human characters in our society. It is, therefore, appropriate and necessary to prevent people with violent criminal histories from becoming carers. The last thing our society needs is to have people with a history of unleashing violent assaults in a position of trust with a person who is unable to defend themselves. Unfortunately, these situations do happen and disabled people do become victims of abuse from their carer. One struggles to comprehend what it would be like to be assaulted with no possibility of defending yourself or escaping that attack. One struggles to comprehend placing your complete trust in someone to look after you, only to be stabbed in the back by a cowardly assault. It is not just the physical act that is appalling; it is the ongoing trauma that the victim experiences. Reliving the horror of such an attack would be horrible enough on its own, but imagine being disabled and experiencing such a cowardly attack. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092710"></A>
Having your trust broken and being in such a vulnerable position would truly be terrifying. The fear that you could be assaulted again in the future and knowing that you are unable to do anything about it would be overwhelming. It would be hard to trust a carer again, yet they are not able to go about their lives without a carer helping them. These types of events impact on how they interact with their carers and also with the rest of society. Our disabled citizens deserve to be protected like other vulnerable people in our community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092713"></A>
Another vulnerable group in our society is children, and this parliament has taken steps in the past to protect them. The requirement of holding a blue card before working with children and being put in a position of trust with them is a simple measure that works. There is a perception amongst the community that it works, and sometimes the perception becomes reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092714"></A>
Our disabled citizens deserve similar measures to protect them. This bill will do that by creating a system of carer prohibition notices, which will prevent people with criminal histories of violence from caring for the disabled. This legislation is very important because it helps protect those who are most vulnerable in our community. Protecting the disabled from people with a history of violent assaults is a simple step we can take as a parliament to make our most vulnerable citizens feel safe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092715"></A>
Before closing, I have to report that I do have some concerns with the bill, particularly in relation to the issuing of blue cards. As I said before, there is a perception that the blue cards have been good, and that reputation needs to be protected. For the point I wish to make, I will use the Bundaberg Steam Tramway Preservation Society as an example. It runs a small locomotive in one of the beautiful parks in Bundaberg. The volunteers were issued with blue cards, but they have been told, and I quote, ‘We have encouraged the society to consider as part of their general occasional risk management strategy what policies and procedures they have in place to minimise risks of harm to children.’ The Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian sent a letter saying that the volunteers no longer need blue cards because their primary focus is not children. But those who have been to Bundaberg know that hundreds of thousands of people use this train every year, and it is predominantly for the children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092721"></A>
The workers were all issued with blue cards, but this is one example of a small group--with approximately 200 volunteers--which will no longer get the blue cards. They will need to have, according to the words I just quoted, risk management policies and procedures in place, but they had an assurance that they would be covered by the blue card for their insurance and for other purposes. To maintain that high level, they will now need to have criminal history checks done, which could cost up to $60 or $70 each. So organisations which have 200 volunteers who used to have blue cards will now have a huge financial burden on them because they will now need to get criminal history checks done. That is a cost for this one small group of $70 times 200. I would like that issue to be clarified later.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092723"></A>
There are also other clubs which could be affected, like the Rotary clubs, the Lions clubs, the Apex clubs. Community and sporting organisations that do not have a majority of young children--it might be 60-40--will now need to have criminal history checks done. I hope the financial bean counters have actually worked out what the cost will be to the community of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092725"></A>
The benefits of the blue card have been immense, and I would hate to see that reputation being put aside because of any financial restraints. Without further ado, I will conclude by saying that I support the bill and thank the minister and the shadow minister for the hard work they have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092728"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (8.44 pm): I rise to speak to the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill 2009. I thank the minister for the briefing that her staff provided. I note that the sheer size of the bill was enough to frighten anybody in terms of being able to understand all of the implications of the legislative amendments. The minister’s staff, however, assured us that the bulk of the bill related to getting consistent amendments to a series of pieces of legislation, and that is what caused the amount of changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092729"></A>
The reason for this legislation is to reduce the duplication for screening and also to set up notifications between jurisdictions. I applaud that. I do have a question though: that is, will there be regular audits to protect against system failure? The bigger the system and the bigger the connection between departments and between elements in a department, the greater the risk of failure of the system and the greater the risk that people who should not be getting approved could be approved. I will be interested to hear the minister comment on what audit provisions there will be to ensure there is not a breakdown in this interjurisdictional connection. Any reduction in red tape is certainly important, but it is in such a vulnerable area, an area of intrinsic importance, so it is vital that there is no breakdown.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092731"></A>
I think it was the member for Currumbin who commented in relation to my question about criminal history checks on surrogate applicants. I again raise the concern that I think there will be a significant portion of the community who start the surrogacy process who will have no criminal history screening, and I believe we could be making a mistake in leaving what will be a very vulnerable group of young children without any protection. In saying that, I am not casting aspersions on surrogate parents. It is just that we have quite significant protections for children in care, for children in preschools and for children who are assisted by volunteers in schools and preschools, but in this area where a little baby will be going into a home there is no protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092732"></A>
The minister’s staff gave us a concise document that outlined the proposed significant amendments, I thank the minister for that. I value that because it made it simpler to understand the thrust of the bill. The bill will reduce duplication by allowing registered teachers and police officers to be able to apply for an exemption from holding a blue card when providing child regulated services. One would hope that that group of community members would be able to be trusted, although I do believe that at all levels there has to be a degree of screening to ensure that everybody who has a contact of trust with young people should be in that position of trust.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092735"></A>
I am not going to speak to all of the elements, but the bill states that blue card holders will be able to apply for an exemption from holding a yellow card. A yellow card is required for a person working with an adult with a disability. I think that is an eminently logical exemption, and I believe that will not only streamline the process but also reduce cost, given that this legislation introduces a fee for a yellow card which previously did not exist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092737"></A>
The other issue I want to raise relates to the cost implication. Other members have talked about the increasing cost. When the blue card was first introduced, the cost for applying--which did not apply to everybody--was $40. It has increased over time to be $65, and now under this legislation it is $70, which is almost double. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096885"></A>
I have talked to volunteers in my electorate--people who are very generous in spirit. They do not have a problem with the process, but many of these people are retirees and $70 is a significant amount of money for them to find when they are offering themselves on a volunteer basis to benefit others. One of the groups in my electorate sit with young people who have problems with literacy and they read with them. These people now need a blue card. They are retirees, and one group lives in a retirement village. $70 for them is a lot. Given that under the federal government regulations the nursing home can take 80 per cent of their pension, they do not have a lot left over. I believe we have to keep a very close check on the cost of these cards. It is more acceptable perhaps for people who are earning an income, but for people who are not earning an income these additional charges will add to the issues that they must consider before they offer themselves on a volunteer basis. The same will apply to a yellow card. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096888"></A>
Having said that, I in no way want to undermine the importance of people who work with our children and people who work with individuals with disabilities--that those people are appropriate people; that their motives are pure; that their motives are good; and that they do not have any underlying agenda. I will always support legislation in this chamber that will give protection to people in our community who are vulnerable, both our young people and people with disabilities--both physical and mental disabilities. However, I do ask the minister to respond to the question of whether there will be an audit process on a regular basis to ensure that a breakdown does not occur and that there will be a tight reign placed on the cost of these cards. As I said, many people who apply for them are volunteering, and it is a cost that they should not have to bear. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr GIBSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gympie--LNP) (8.51 pm): I rise tonight to make a contribution to the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill and the LNP’s Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. At the outset, I would like to place on the record my admiration and tribute to the overwhelming majority of the organisations, the professionals who are involved--both the paid and the volunteers who assist--and the directors of the various organisations that help, because it is the efforts of all in these sectors that need to be recognised. What the bill does today I believe is important, but it is also important to recognise the work that is done in somewhat difficult circumstances. From time to time it is not easy work, but it can be some of the most rewarding work that people can engage in.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096891"></A>
We have to recognise that there are vulnerable groups in our community, and those who are disabled fall into that category of some of the most vulnerable. I would go on to say that disabled children are the most vulnerable in that category. That is why we in this parliament and the government of the day have the responsibility of ensuring that we have the best system for those vulnerable members of our community involving the best checks and balances possible for all those who work in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096892"></A>
I would like to acknowledge the great work of the LNP shadow minister. It is something that needs to be recognised, particularly when in opposition we do not have the resources of the department to draw upon. Putting forward a bill that is genuinely looking at addressing a need is something that needs to be recognised. I would also like to recognise the minister and her departmental staff. As has been indicated, the bill before the House is incredibly comprehensive. I acknowledge that that takes time. You cannot just take an idea and make it into a bill. You have to ensure that it covers all of those areas, and I believe we see that with this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096893"></A>
It is important that we recognise the bipartisan nature of the two bills that are before the House tonight. As has been pointed out on many occasions, what is often reported is the adversarial nature of this parliament. What is not covered in the depth that it should be is the bipartisan spirit that occurs when a problem is identified and is moved forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096894"></A>
While many have spoken about many of the details of this bill, I believe it is important to go back to the time line that really drove this bill and that brings us here to debate it tonight. Eighteen months ago in this House a question was posed to the minister by the member for Burdekin regarding a man with disabilities being placed in the care of an individual with a violent criminal history. It is tragic that in this case the man was assaulted by his carer and suffered trauma, and his family endured great distress. That is understandable, because families who rely upon carers and the support that they provide are placing their trust in another individual. When that trust is breached, it comes back onto themselves and they feel guilt and concern about ‘what if’ and ‘where could we go’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096896"></A>
As indicated, the LNP identified that shortcoming. About four months ago we saw the introduction into this House of the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. That was a genuine attempt to address a concern. I note that the government’s bill was introduced two weeks ago. I am of the view that the government intended to do its homework properly. The bill before the House, as I indicated, shows a very comprehensive approach to that. It is unfortunate, though--and I do not mean this as a slur on anyone involved--that 18 months had to pass, because during that period of time there was ongoing concern. It is very unfortunate that we have to have these bills and subsequent laws before the House at all. We would like to think that those in whom we place our trust in our society would not breach it. However, it is an unfortunate fact that a very small minority do breach that trust. When they do so, they unfortunately besmirch the good reputation of others who work in these sectors. We must protect the most vulnerable. If that impacts on less than one per cent of people who act in a heinous manner, then I support it because I believe it is important that we move forward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096897"></A>
During my time at university I had a great opportunity to work as a carer for nine months. In those days the circumstances were somewhat different. It is not as it is now, where carers work on a much smaller basis. We had large institutions that were involved in care. In my job I was able to work the night shift at one of those institutions that cared for disabled children. Not all of those children had language skills. Not all of those children were able to function in what we would consider simple, ordinary tasks. The role of the carer is one that I am very conscious of. I applied for the job simply from an advertisement. At that time, there was no history check and no experience was required. I was given the opportunity to care each night for the children in that institution--and for a uni student it was an ideal situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101042"></A>
It comes back to the fact that, and I wish to stress this, the majority--I believe greater than 99 per cent--of those who work in these industries--those who give of their time, whether it be paid or those who give of a greater sacrifice in terms of their time without any form of recompense because they do so with a desire to assist--are good people and should be trusted. But, as has been pointed out, when that trust is breached, we find ourselves responding in the manner in which we are tonight--a manner which will ensure that those most vulnerable in our community will be protected. There has been much said about the detail of the bill, and it is not my intention to repeat what has already been said. Anything that can cut duplication should be welcomed. Anything that involves a reduction in red tape should be welcomed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101043"></A>
Of course there are costs that are associated with that, and I would encourage the government, as I know our shadow minister did in drafting his bill, to look at the most cost-effective ways that we can bring about these arrangements so that the costs do not rest on the already-stretched budgets of those organisations that are doing a fantastic job and getting more bang for the buck than we see in many other areas. We do not want to put an additional cost burden on to them unnecessarily, but we do need to ensure that as we legislate to protect the most vulnerable in our society we do so in a measured way and in a way that will result in the outcomes that we seek. I am not that optimistic to say that as a result of tonight we will never see an incident where an individual will not face abuse or some form of torment from a carer. I would like to think that tonight will be the end of it. Unfortunately, I am a pragmatist and I realise that that will not be the case. But tonight we send a clear message out from this House to the people of Queensland and to those who do a fantastic job that we are supporting them and we are protecting the most vulnerable, and for that I commend both bills to the House.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (9.00 pm): In making a contribution to this cognate debate tonight, I want to put on the record my support for the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This place is more than a forum for debate and assessment of policy ideas. Through the legislative process we must always try to bring some common sense and practicality to the final implementation of these policies. We must also not forget the enormous administrative impact that our words and decisions in parliament have on the public servants who diligently implement these initiatives and, of course, the impact on the end user. Our decisions have flow-on effects right across the community--in schools, child care, sports associations, clubs, disabled and age-care facilities, and the list goes on.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101049"></A>
Since 2001 the blue card system has significantly assisted service providers to go about their business in the human services sector, our justice system and non-government organisations--all the while protecting our most vulnerable Queenslanders. Through the effective administration of blue card related functions, the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian plays a critical role in providing safeguards for children and young people in regulated service environments. In 2008-09, the commission monitored over 466,000 blue card holders and applicants, providing advice and acting to minimise potential at-risk situations in over 600 cases. During this period the commission processed more than a quarter of a million blue card applications and embarked on an awareness-raising campaign about the application process and cardholder obligations to a similar number.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101050"></A>
The blue card concept has worked well in this state. However, we must make every effort to continue to not only improve the integrity and consistency of the screening system but also ensure that it is a pragmatic system that is based on reality. While the system must continue to reflect the high expectations that our community has for the screening of individuals who work with children, we should always aim to streamline the process, reduce costs--both to government and to users--and avoid duplication wherever possible. The provisions of the government’s bill achieve this by providing exemptions for professionals who operate in a regulated service environment who may also work with children in another capacity--for example, registered teachers and police officers involved with junior sport or youth groups. Under the current regime, this would necessitate an application for a blue card. The changes proposed under this bill mean these people need only apply for an exemption--at no cost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101051"></A>
Comprehensive criminal history checks have already been undertaken on these individuals in the first instance. They have already satisfied strict requirements. In addition, existing blue card holders will be able to apply for an exemption from holding a yellow card and registered health practitioners, including nurses and midwives, will be automatically exempt from requiring a blue card or yellow card when they are providing services to children as well as adults with a disability in the discharge of their professional duties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101052"></A>
The proposed legislation would also have a positive impact on the hip pocket of individuals in paid employment. The renewal period would be extended from two years to three years for new applications for blue cards and yellow cards--those who work for organisations that are funded by government to work with disabled Queenslanders. For paid employees who hold a blue card, this would mean a reduction in the annual rate from $30.93 per year to $23.33 per year. These same fees would apply to holders of yellow cards in paid employment in order to meet the proposed new criteria. These workers will, under the government’s proposal, be required to hold a blue card like anyone else who works with children. The need to hold a yellow card for existing blue card holders who want to work with adults with a disability would be removed. Under the new arrangements for both systems, volunteers would remain exempt from paying a fee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101053"></A>
With regard to the exclusionary frameworks, the amendments would see a stronger alignment of the blue card, yellow card and teacher registration systems. Individuals convicted of certain serious sexual offences are effectively banned from working in child related employment or government provided or funded disability services. Persons excluded are those subject to reporting obligations under the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004; those on orders under the Child Protection (Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2008; those on orders under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003; or those who have been convicted of a disqualifying offence and received an imprisonment order for the offence. People subject to any of these orders are banned from applying for either a blue or yellow card.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101057"></A>
Aligning these frameworks means that the blue and yellow card systems will exclude people with the same types of police information and improve safeguards for children, as well as adults with a disability. These changes are an important element in making sure that the exemption notice system does not allow for loopholes in one system that would allow entry into another. These changes are to be commended for improving criminal history screening safeguards and, consequently, the safety of our children. The Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill will not significantly alter requirements for the blue card. It will, however, pave the way for a substantial reduction of red tape. I congratulate the minister and her department for their work on the bill. If passed, this bill will be a win for common sense.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (9.05 pm): In rising to support the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill, I congratulate the minister on presenting the bill to this House. The bill reduces duplication of screening for people seeking to work or volunteer services to children in two ways. Firstly, it effectively links existing screening systems to avoid multiple criminal history checks being undertaken. Currently, police officers and registered teachers are only exempt from holding a blue card when providing child regulated services as part of their professional duties. Now they may also apply for an exemption when providing child regulated services which fall outside their professional duties--for example, when a police officer volunteers at a local sporting club.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101062"></A>
The commission will confirm the person is entitled to an exemption and an exemption will be automatically granted unless the person has a criminal history that requires further consideration to operate unconditionally across the variety of service environments in which a blue card can be used. As well, registered health practitioners will now not be required to hold a blue card or a yellow card when undertaking their professional duties in child regulated contexts. For example, school based nurses will not require a blue card and GPs providing services to adults with a disability in regulated environments will not require a yellow card. An applicant for teacher registration will be able to rely on their blue card and a duplicate criminal history check will not be undertaken unless further assessment is required about a person’s suitability to teach. For example, an applicant for teacher registration who obtained a blue card to undertake their student placement will generally not need to undergo another criminal history check and blue card holders may apply for an exemption from holding a yellow card--for example, when a blue card holder works with adults with a disability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101064"></A>
The bill also reduces duplication by, secondly, amalgamating screening for certain people who work in regulated child related environments. The following individuals will now be screened under the blue card system--namely, all individuals providing services to children with disabilities will now be required to obtain a blue card rather than be screened under the yellow card system; all employees and volunteers of state government entities engaged in child related roles will be required to obtain a blue card rather than be screened by the individual departments; all health students undertaking placement that involves service delivery to children within private or public facilities will require a blue card; and all employees and volunteers of local governments undertaking child related duties will now also require a blue card.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101065"></A>
The amendments are anticipated to reduce the number of criminal history checks undertaken in the first three years alone of implementation by approximately 100,000. That is a tremendous reduction in duplication of services. In concluding, I want to thank all the people, especially those in Albert, in paid employment or volunteers who support and encourage children, whether it be in schools, junior sports or disability services. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (9.09 pm), in reply: From the outset I would like to thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the bill that I introduced, the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill, which was debated in cognate with the government bill, the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill. I do not intend to take up a deal of the time of the House in reply to the debate on the LNP’s bill, save to do three things: firstly, to respond to the concerns of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee; secondly, to reiterate the principles, values and objectives contained in the bill put forward by the LNP; and, thirdly, to respond to the contribution of the Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs to this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101099"></A>
With respect to the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee on the bill that I introduced, I thank the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee for its constructive and reasonable comments in respect of the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. The committee raised the issue of whether the bill has sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. The committee drew the attention of members to clause 4 of the bill, which, it is suggested, may affect the rights and liberties of individuals engaged or seeking to be engaged as a disability support carer. Although I acknowledge that point of view--and it was a view that was raised, I think, by the member for Toowoomba North in respect of the government’s bill--I would argue that priority consideration has to be given to the rights of vulnerable people with disabilities who must trust in their carers implicitly. A breach of this trust has devastating effects on the person with a disability, often extending beyond physical wellbeing to social interaction and emotional development. It is a choice to work in the field of disability support services. It is not a choice to have a disability. The role of the government is to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. In this case, people with disabilities need more legislative protection and enshrinement of liberties and rights than do carers with criminal histories. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101100"></A>
In addition, I would point out that similar, although not identical, concerns are raised in respect of the government’s bill, the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill, by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. The explanatory notes accompanying the bill seek to justify concerns in respect of a potential breach of privacy rights by arguing that the risk of such a breach is necessary to effectively protect the best interests and safety of children as well as persons with a disability and to ensure that adequate safeguards have been put in place where appropriate. I think it is important, as part of this summing-up process, that I reiterate some of the important principles that are being pursued by the LNP opposition by introducing this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101101"></A>
The LNP feels that there needs to be legislative effort to try to enhance the confidence not only that people with disabilities can have but also that families and the wider community can have in the integrity of the important relationship between a carer and the people for whom they care. The bill that I introduced in October last year is designed to help protect people with a disability from being put in the care of someone who has a history of violence or abuse. The bill will allow people with disabilities to have confidence in their carer and it will also allow disability service providers to employ carers with confidence. I regret the advice from the Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs that the Bligh government will not support the LNP in attempting to achieve this important goal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101102"></A>
The overwhelming majority of carers in our community are exemplary people who give so much of themselves to improve the lives of people with disabilities. As I said when I introduced this bill, the contribution of carers is very often of a value well in excess of the remuneration they receive. They are essential service providers. They do their work with sincerity and, unfortunately, sometimes they provide the only genuine connection between their clients and the outside world. Indeed, in many cases carers enhance the quality of life of their clients. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101103"></A>
However, as I said when I made a contribution to the debate on the government’s bill, tragically there will be the odd occasion when the trust between a person with a disability and a carer is breached. This is an unfortunate reality that we have to face up to. Let me share with honourable members two distressing examples of when these breaches of trust occur. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1101109"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (9.14 pm): Recent reports put community safety volunteer associations receiving $2.6 million in grants. Of that amount, the Volunteer Marine Rescue Association--or VMR--was reported to receive nearly $600,000. That sounds like a large sum, but let me break it down. That means that $22,542 was available for each of the 25 Volunteer Marine Rescue groups to manage their boat replacement program. I have the honour of hosting a Volunteer Marine Rescue group in my electorate. In fact, the Jacobs Well Volunteer Marine Rescue is the only Queensland Ambulance Service first responder on the water for personal injury cases in Queensland. That group’s patch encompasses all waterways from the north arm of the Coomera River to the northern point of Macleay Island in the north and 50 nautical miles out to sea. The Jacobs Well VMR has a total of four vessels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101113"></A>
In the past two years, the vessel replacement program at Jacobs Well cost $473,000. That program included the replacement of two vessels, new engines for those two vessels, the refit of one vessel that was due to be replaced--but because of a lack of funds a refit was done--and a replacement engine on an additional vessel. Vessels are replaced every 10 years and engines are replaced every two years. The suggestion that a contribution of $22,542 can appropriately accommodate the vessel replacement program beggars belief. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101114"></A>
I turn to the ongoing costs. The running costs of engines is $60 to $70 per hour per vessel. The primary rescue vessel holds 500 litres of unleaded petrol and uses it in just six hours. Last year total fuel expenses at the Jacobs Well VMR were approximately $43,000. The total operational cost of the Jacobs Well VMR is approximately $250,000 per financial year. The average cost for each volunteer in their first year in this vital service is $1,100 out of their own back pocket. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101115"></A>
What about the important work that these volunteers do? Over the past two years, activations at the Jacobs Well VMR were 40 medicals, of which 16 were Queensland Ambulance Service activations. There were 620 vessel assistance activations, of which 29 were Queensland Police Service activations. The total patrols or training amounted to 1,068 activations. The Jacobs Well VMR fielded 6,425 radio and telephone communications over that period. They put in many hours of ongoing training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101116"></A>
This group is made up 100 per cent of volunteers--people putting their own time and their own money into a cause that saves peoples’ lives and their property. Today, the very important and relevant point was made to me that if those vessel assistance activations did not occur in a timely fashion by these volunteers then in many cases they would soon become medical activations. I make these points and call on this government to fund more adequately the Volunteer Marine Rescue Association to ensure that it remains a viable essential service.</Hansard-Body>

Strike, Mr Arthur, OAM</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101119"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (9.17 pm): On Thursday, 18 February this year, one of the great community leaders of Cairns, Mr Arthur Strike OAM passed away, aged 92. Arthur Strike received the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 1991 Queen’s Birthday honours in the General Division for service to local government and to the community, particularly through the Noah’s Ark toy library. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101125"></A>
Arthur was born 92 years ago, on 10 November 1917, in Richmond. As a young man he joined the Labor Party and remained a staunch member for close on 70 years. He served the community with tremendous effort and with great heart for all of those years. Right up until the last days of his life, even when his movement was physically limited, he was still organising things on behalf of those in the community for whom he felt a soft spot. These people were particularly those who suffered from disabilities, or difficulties, or barriers in life. He had a particularly soft spot for children with disabilities and for very many years spent hours beyond count working for children with disabilities. In particular, Arthur set up the Noah’s Ark toy library and was recognised for that service, although it was a small part of the huge work that he did on behalf of those children. That has been recognised, I am pleased to say, in a lasting way by ARC Disability Services in Cairns naming a building after Arthur Strike. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105658"></A>
Arthur also cared tremendously about children, particularly on the sports field. He became a coach in cricket and rugby and spent very many years doing his best to encourage children to participate in sport and to play every game fairly. He developed a passion for speedway racing and decided that the facilities in Cairns definitely needed a boost and that he would become their patron. He raised countless thousands of dollars for them. The speedway in Cairns is, in fact, proudly called the Arthur Strike Park Raceway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105659"></A>
Arthur served on the Cairns City Council as an alderman and as a deputy mayor over a period of 21 years. His contribution to Cairns cannot be measured. He was an absolutely amazing fundraiser for very many causes. He had such a humble manner that one could not turn him down. Heaven knows how many hundreds of thousands of dollars he raised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105660"></A>
He will be sorely missed by his son, Brian, by Gayle and by members of the family, but others of us gathered to celebrate a life truly well lived, with a huge contribution made to the people of Cairns and the region. I hope indeed that he is in heaven with his beloved wife, Julia. </Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.21 pm): I rise tonight to express how absolutely ecstatic I am about the return of the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships to its natural home of Kurrawa on our fabulous Gold Coast next month. I congratulate Surf Life Saving Queensland on making this happen, and I wish them every success for an outstanding and thoroughly entertaining event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105664"></A>
The Gold Coast has the necessary infrastructure to present such a world-class event and we do it well. We have beautiful beaches, perfect weather and fantastic facilities. We have all levels of accommodation available to the 10,000 participants, supporters and visitors--from backpacker facilities right up to five-star hotels that can fulfil all accommodation needs. Around $15 million will be generated for Queensland through the staging of this event. It is a classic example of spending a small amount of money to generate a large amount for the Queensland economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105665"></A>
In 1996 I was the mayor of the Gold Coast when the inaugural Australian Surf Life Saving Championships was captured for a 10-year contract at Kurrawa through the Gold Coast City Council promising $200,000 each year for 10 years. That was a commitment and I was proud to be part of it. With the super success of the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships on the Gold Coast in the past, it should never have left, but because of the failure of this state Labor government and Queensland Events to negotiate a positive outcome with Surf Life Saving Australia it slipped out of their hands and ventured across to Western Australia, where all reports said it failed miserably. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105666"></A>
This is just another example of the inept and incompetent Bligh government that does not seem to be able to deliver a successful event, despite the fact that it has the best natural attributes of any state in Australia. It seems that everything it lays its hands on just disappears, such as the Indy carnival, the Queensland Winter Racing Carnival and possibly even the Magic Millions carnival. The victims of these constant failures are the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105667"></A>
We have not seen any sign of our New South Wales based ex-Qantas boss Geoff Dixon anywhere near Queensland since he was appointed the chairman of Queensland Events. He has not come up with one new suggestion since he was appointed to the role. Do the Premier and the Minister for Tourism believe there are no suitable Queensland tourism entrepreneurs who could run Queensland Events more efficiently and effectively than our current New South Wales phantom? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105668"></A>
The Gold Coast is the natural home of iconic sporting events, with its ready-made infrastructure available for immediate use. When an event such as the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships fits so well with the locality and services it can provide, it should never again be lost to Queensland or the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105673"></A>
The report is titled <Hansard-Italic>
Report into Aboriginal Customary Law and the Murri Courts</Hansard-Italic>
. In the preparation of this document, Sam had discussions with local Aboriginal elder Uncle Peter Bind and with judicial and administrative officers of the Murri Court system and observed the Murri Court in action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105674"></A>
The Murri Courts throughout Queensland deal with pleas of guilty to offences that can be heard by a magistrate. Indigenous elders are involved in the process, the objective being to incorporate customary law in the sentences to reduce recidivism and the overrepresentation of Murri people in the criminal justice system. Sam concludes that the scope for additional incorporation of customary law concepts in the criminal law is limited. Customary law processes like community endorsed punishments, the involvement of elders and the shaming of offenders should be strengthened, but the application of traditional punishments further than is presently practised he thinks is not practical. However, he suggests that there is scope for expansion by giving the Murri Courts a civil jurisdiction. Sam Hussey-Smith writes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105675"></A>
Disputes between individuals are common in customary law settings, and discrete Aboriginal dispute resolution mechanisms have existed to deal with them for thousands of years. When resolving disputes between individuals in traditional Indigenous communities, the focus was not on restitution for the wronged person, but on engaging all parties in a consensus-based process designed to restore community harmony as quickly as possible.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1105676"></A>
He continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105677"></A>
The Murri Court structure is flexible enough for it to deal with a number of legal issues and disputes, and not just the sentencing of offenders. Inter-clan disputes, which are a particular problem in larger urban areas with overlapping tribal land claims, could be resolved through the Murri Courts. Individual, inter- or intra-family disputes could also be heard in the Murri Courts, incorporating the traditional authority of elders and the opinions and concerns of affected community members. Widening the jurisdiction of the Murri Courts to include civil claims and other matters could also reduce the negative perceptions of the justice system held by many Aborigines, as they come to see the Australian legal system as a means for peace, order and social cohesiveness, rather than simply as a mechanism for punishment. A more open and culturally appropriate courtroom setting could also encourage Aboriginal people to resolve disputes through the conventional legal system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Road Safety, Schools</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.27 pm): I rise this evening to address two key transport issues in my electorate. Members would note my keen interest in road safety around schools, so it would come as no surprise that I speak about this tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105682"></A>
The issue of road safety has been prevalent around Meridan State College. I point out that the road networks that surround the school are indeed council roads and not state roads, but I fundamentally believe that if a state government plonks a school in the middle of a residential subdivision then the state bears a certain level of responsibility to ensure that the children of that school can arrive at and depart safely from school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105683"></A>
Meridan State College has sustained substantial growth in the past two years and the department has failed to properly plan for this growth in terms of car parking, drop-off zones and the general flow of local vehicle and pedestrian traffic. It came to a point where a local parent organised a community rally for the governmental council to act and install a safe passageway for children to cross a busy road. The application by developer AV Jennings has been held up in council bureaucracy for many years. They have been desperately wanting to help, but this bureaucracy held them back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105684"></A>
Late last year I contacted the developer, AV Jennings, in an attempt to intervene and improve the situation as I believed there was still potential for an agreement to be forged. I am happy to inform the House that the developer, AV Jennings, is now funding two crossing supervisors to allow students to safely travel to school. These supervisors will enable students to safely walk along the footpath on Parklands Boulevard, which crosses to the other side of the road at the Ivadale Boulevard roundabout. The developer, AV Jennings, should be commended for its act of goodwill and community spirit. Members would think that a state that plonks a school in the middle of a residential subdivision would install a pedestrian crossing and pay for the traffic supervisors, but we have to rely on a third-party independent developer in this situation to pay for traffic supervisors so that the children who attend the school can cross the road safely to school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105685"></A>
A similar issue regularly occurs at Kawana Waters State College. Nicklin Way, which is the main arterial road connecting motorists from Caloundra to Maroochydore, borders the college and students are crossing this road at will in the morning and afternoon as there is no safe passage to the other side. There are no traffic lights or a pedestrian crossing at which to cross. The P&amp;C have raised these concerns with the CoastConnect project team as the project was being revised and consultation sought, but no response has been given by this government. In the latest revised concept plan published by the department of transport, the intersection of Thunderbird Drive and Nicklin Way has been designated as a possibility for future traffic lights. Action needs to be taken now. We cannot sit around and wait for a child to be hurt trying to get to school. Action needs to be taken now.</Hansard-Body>

South-East Queensland Desalination Plant<Hansard-Bold>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (9.29 pm): The only real threat to Bribie Island is the LNP and its current plan to build a massive desalination plant there. It is the LNP’s only proposed new source of water for the whole of South-East Queensland. There is no evidence to suggest the LNP is basing this proposal on any scientific or environmental studies. Its decision is motivated purely by politics; this is a Labor-held seat. Even the independent Queensland Water Commission states quite clearly that the best site for a desalination plant is Marcoola and the Bligh Labor government strongly supports that site for that reason. The commission identified Lytton as the next best site and then the expansion of the existing Tugun plant, which the government also supports. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110078"></A>
I have tabled in parliament a petition with over 1,000 signatures protesting against a desalination plant on Bribie Island. I have always said that I am against any move to place one there, particularly since there are better sites. When I talk to residents, they believe a desalination plant on Bribie Island will destroy their quality of life and they do not want it. They acknowledge they are surrounded by the protected Moreton Bay Marine Park and they are concerned about the impact that hundreds of heavy vehicles would have on our roads and bridge. Those who genuinely care about the environment recognize Bribie Island as a flora and fauna reserve and worry that a desalination plant would threaten the underground aquifers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110079"></A>
For as long as I can remember--my husband Jon and I have lived on Bribie Island for 26 years--the Liberals and Nationals have wanted to turn Bribie Island into an industrial estate. They have suggested everything from a coal loading facility to a wood chipping plant, a satellite city with a population of 300,000 located at the fragile northern tip, John Howard’s nuclear power station and now the LNP’s massive desalination plant. I am not the only one warning locals about attending any meetings against desalination if there is any LNP involvement. It is the height of hypocrisy for anyone in the LNP to be involved, because it is LNP policy to build a desalination plant there if ever they were to win government in this state. A three-times failed LNP candidate, a newcomer to the Island, has said that we should not have a desalination plant on Bribie. I quote from a leaked email from this failed LNP candidate, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110080"></A>
We’ll tell any new Government that we won’t tolerate desalination here. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1110081"></A>
Yet it is his party that wants to foist it on us. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110082"></A>
Senior members of the LNP have stated publicly that they want a desalination plant on Bribie Island. On 612 ABC Radio the member for Maroochydore, whose electorate covers Marcoola, has said the desalination plant proposal for Marcoola is disastrous for the future. The member for Noosa has said it was not a project that locals wanted. The LNP water plan can be viewed at www.climateproof.com.au and copies are available from the Pumicestone electorate office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110084"></A>
Let us contrast the LNP with Anna Bligh’s Labor government. We have spent billions on securing water for South-East Queensland and whilst the Traveston Dam will not proceed, the desalination plants at Marcoola and Lytton will. Those who say there are other ways of providing enough water have never been able to explain how an adequate supply can be provided to our growing population. Suggesting harvesting stormwater will not provide all our needs. It has some profound difficulties and those challenges are glossed over by those opponents of desalination. Perhaps in 20 years the technology will allow some--</Hansard-Body>

Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (9.33 pm): The 2010 Guide Dogs Queensland’s annual Pawknock appeal runs from 21 February to 6th March. Around 4,000 volunteers will hit the streets or email their friends to donate, and I encourage all Queenslanders, if at all possible, to contribute to this vital fundraising campaign. Guide Dogs Queensland’s head office, breeding and training centre is located in Bald Hills in the Aspley electorate. On many occasions I have had the pleasure of visiting the facility to get a better understanding of what the organisation provides for the vision impaired. Since 1960, Guide Dogs Queensland has been helping to equip, empower, and educate vision-impaired Queenslanders of all ages, regions and circumstances through the offering of a broad range of orientation and mobility services. Of course, as the name suggests, Guide Dogs Queensland is mainly known for its star attraction, the guide dogs, but the services of our canine friends are just one piece of the suite of services provided by the organisation. Endeavouring to provide a total service to the vision-impaired community, Guide Dogs Queensland also provides white cane training, electronic travel aids training, community and professional education workshops, mobility services for children and psycho-social services.</Hansard-Body>

The organisation is ably led by its CEO, Ms Chris Laine, and its services are delivered both on and off site through the community and through specifically adapted residential services where clients receive education and training while living in purpose-built accommodation at Bald Hills. Last year when I toured the facility, I was put through my paces by Basshir Ebrahim as he tried to instruct me in the use of the white cane. Everyone should be encouraged to experience the difficulties faced by those with a disability and I am so glad that I was able to ‘walk in the moccasins’ of a vision-impaired person, if only for a brief moment. It was a true test of my abilities as I discovered that the smallest of things can be a big issue when you are vision impaired. </Hansard-Body>

With regional offices all over Queensland, thousands of people seek Guide Dogs Queensland’s support, training and resources to assist them remain active at work and play every day. That is why this organisation deserves our support. I am sure we have all seen guide dogs diligently assisting their owners when navigating our streets, shopping centres, and transport services. I am sure members would agree that those dogs provide a marvellous service to their owners. Not only do they provide them with the sight that they lack, but they can also be a valuable companion or addition to a family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110092"></A>
Finally, I want to congratulate Guide Dogs Queensland on its achievement of turning 50 this year. The golden anniversary will be marked on International Guide Dogs Day, 28 April, and later in the year with an open day and concert. I wish the organisation every success in planning for this momentous occasion.</Hansard-Body>

The Learning Link Bridge, Auntie Linda Link</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (Woodridge--ALP) (9.36 pm): The recent completion and opening of the long-awaited pedestrian overpass bridge between the Mabel Park State School and Mabel Park State High School offered a unique opportunity to commemorate and remember in perpetuity the life of a much-loved Indigenous education counsellor, Aunty Linda Link, in naming the bridge The Learning Link. The pedestrian bridge was a government commitment made by the Hon. Paul Lucas in the wake of the sad death of a student outside Redcliffe State High School. The first pedestrian overpass was named Caitlin’s Crossing. The Mabel Park schools straddle busy Paradise Road in Slacks Creek, which is also the dividing line between Evan Moorhead’s Waterford and my Woodridge electorates. The site has seen students injured on the busy roadway and, while our government has responded over the years by installing two sets of traffic lights, none the less at times students will take risks and the results can be disastrous. Therefore, this community now has the ultimate safety feature, a bridge that is designed for disability access, enclosed for traffic safety and, with the removal of the traffic lights, which will allow for more free-flowing traffic.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110101"></A>
This bridge, now named the Learning Link, is a fitting tribute to Aunty Linda who, for more than 20 years, nurtured and inspired possibly thousands of students, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, at Mabel Park and Woodridge State High Schools and Kingston College, as well as many other schools. She commenced her work as a teacher aide at Mabel Park State High School in 1984. Although her own education had ended abruptly in year 4 because of family circumstances, in 1996 she completed a degree through James Cook University, at which time she was granted a permanent position as an Indigenous education counsellor. She and her husband Roy raised seven children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110103"></A>
Whether it was her own children or grandchildren or her students at school, Aunty Linda always believed that education was the key to a bright future for her people. Her children are testament to those strong beliefs. For example, her eldest son Johnathan is a long-serving officer of the Royal Flying Doctor Service based in Cairns and her youngest daughter, Selina, is near to completing a law degree. A rollcall of her students would include teachers, lawyers, social workers, accountants, physiotherapists, chefs, sporting high-achievers, secretaries, tradesmen and myriad others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110106"></A>
Sadly, Linda passed away in 2003 and tributes include a memorial garden at Mabel Park State High School, the Linda Link Indigenous Centre at Kingston College and, now, our bridge which will be a constant reminder of a treasured life and will be the link between the two campuses to ensure students cross safely. The opening on Friday, 12th February was attended by many of Aunty Linda’s family, who came from as far away as Cairns and New South Wales, along with many local Indigenous elders and community members. It was a wonderful gathering to pay tribute to a remarkable lady. A number of Linda’s family members spoke of this rare individual who dedicated so much of her life to her much-loved students and family. I was privileged to cut the ribbon with Johnathan, her eldest son. You will live on in the hearts of many, Aunty Linda, and never be forgotten. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (9.39 pm): I rise tonight to table a non-conforming petition signed by 880 residents of the community of Monto calling for an urgent upgrade to the main road link to their closest regional centre of Bundaberg. The petition states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110145"></A>
We the undersigned citizens petition the Governments State and Federal for an upgrade of the Mount Perry-Gin Gin road in particular the Oaky creek to Yarrol road turnoff section and to remedy the lack of communication between the Burnett Highway and Mt Perry. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110146"></A>
This petition has been motivated by a terrible head-on accident on the road that claimed the lives of two men. One of the accident victims was Lionel Cavanagh, a schoolteacher who had served the Monto community for 30 years and whom I knew well. Lionel Cavanagh was a very well respected schoolteacher through his initiatives with the school’s cattle club, which gave the high school students the opportunity to show cattle at all the regional shows and at the Brisbane exhibition. He was an outstanding member of the Monto community and was involved in an extensive range of community activities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110148"></A>
His death in the tragic head-on accident on a crest on the unsealed section of the Monto-Mount Perry Road has inspired the community of Monto to instigate a campaign to have the road upgraded to a much safer sealed standard. The sealing of this road is long overdue. It is the primary link to the regional centre of Bundaberg for all Monto residents and it is an appalling failure of regional planning that it remains in such a dangerous unsealed state when every other such road linking smaller towns to nearby regional centres has long since been upgraded to a sealed standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110150"></A>
Local residents have to travel this road for all the same reasons that residents of smaller towns throughout Queensland have to travel to their regional centre. In recent years the changes in the health system, for example, have increased the need for people in Monto to travel to Bundaberg. As the health services available locally have declined, as they have in all small communities, more and more people are referred to Bundaberg for treatment. This often requires multiple trips across a road that is clearly substandard and has seen many minor accidents and near misses before the tragic accident that recently took two lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110151"></A>
In tabling this petition in the parliament tonight, I want to strongly support the campaign that 200 people of Monto instigated at a recent public meeting in their town hall under the slogan of ‘Monto to Mount Perry--No more fatalities’. I call on the Minister for Main Roads to address this critical issue. Why this road has remained unsealed for so long is now irrelevant and there is no place for finger pointing and blame shifting. The road needs to be brought up to a standard more appropriate for a major regional road before there are more tragic accidents claiming more lives. I table the petition. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (9.41 pm): I was very excited to hear the Minister for Child Safety and Minister Sport today announce a suite of new funding programs to encourage participation in sport and recreation. I am an extremely enthusiastic supporter of the government’s initiatives to promote a healthy and active lifestyle, and there is no doubt that these new funding programs will go a long way towards contributing to that outcome. I congratulate the minister on his thoughtful analysis of the way sport and recreation clubs operate, using this as the basis for putting together the new programs. He is a most enthusiastic supporter of sport and recreation and obviously loves his portfolio. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110157"></A>
There is already a lot going on in the Bulimba electorate that encourages a healthy and active lifestyle. There are 35 sporting clubs active in the local community, and it is a pleasure to drive throughout our suburbs on a Saturday or a Sunday--or any night of the week, for that matter--and see children and adults being active in a variety of different ways in our local facilities. We know that none of these activities would be happening without the dedication and commitment of volunteers, and there are no more visible examples of the long-time contribution of our local volunteers than in our four very active swimming clubs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110158"></A>
Last Saturday I had the pleasure of attending as both a mum and an MP a three-way swim meet which was organised by the Cannon Hill Dolphins with the Morningside Flyers and the Norman Park Swim Club. I particularly acknowledge Amanda Shipway for her excellent coordination of this event. It was a truly enjoyable afternoon and a fine example of clubs getting together to make sure kids see sport as not just competition but also an opportunity to be part of a team and to enjoy being active. The kids all did us proud. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110163"></A>
These three clubs, along with the Bulimba Darts Swimming Club, comprise a fair cross-section of the children of the Bulimba electorate. They have been going for a number of years and all of them boast volunteers who have seen them through generations of local children. They can tell much of the history of their clubs and have so much to contribute. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110165"></A>
In the Cannon Hill Dolphins, which has been running for 30 years, there is Sandra Spinaze, who has had six children and now three grandchildren swim for the club; Michelle and Peter Hurketts, who have been with the club for the past 12 years; and also the Forgan family and Paul Norman. In the Morningside Flyers, which has been running for nearly 45 years, there are life members George and Delma Nicholson, Ernie and Lyn Blumel, John and Julie Beale, Michael Mann and Jason and Lisa Spencer. I was very sorry to hear today from Jason that he is stepping down as president after nine years with the club. The Bulimba Darts Swimming Club has long-time volunteers John and Sharni Lovell and the Hoskings family. The Norman Park Swim Club, which has so many enthusiastic volunteers, headed up by David Orchid, has been running for more than 45 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110183"></A>
I thank all of these clubs for the life they give to our local community and the wonderful volunteers who have for so long made them the vibrant organisations that they are. </Hansard-Body>
