 (Sunnybank--ALP) (Leader of the House) (9.31 am): I wish to draw to the attention of the House comments made by the member for Currumbin yesterday that are incorrect--perhaps deliberately misleading--and require correction. The member said--</Hansard-Body>

Yesterday morning we were informed by the Leader of the House that both of these bills are to be debated together in cognate and that both parties will allow a conscience vote on their respective bills. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

On Tuesday morning I offered the opposition the opportunity of suspending standing order 87 so that each of the surrogacy bills could be voted on separately. The opposition informed me that they did not want to take up that offer. So the vote today will be on the government bill only. There will be only one vote, that is on the government bill, and I understand that the LNP vote is not a free vote on the government’s bill. </Hansard-Body>

The opposition, by declining the government’s offer of suspending standing order 87, has denied themselves the opportunity of exercising a conscience vote on their own bill and no conscience vote on our bill. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, on 25 January this year the honourable member for Indooroopilly wrote to me alleging that the Minister for Education and Training had misled the House in an answer to a question on notice. The honourable member alleged that the minister, in answer to question on notice 1857, had informed the House that the minister had reported that the last QBuild inspection of Indooroopilly High School had occurred on 11 March 2009, whereas in a statement to the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 the minister had confirmed that the last inspection was on 16 November 2009.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998548"></A>
In accordance with standing order 269(5), on 29 January I wrote to the minister, enclosing a copy of the member’s allegations and requested a response. On 8 February the honourable the minister provided a response. The minister’s response makes it clear that the answer he provided in the response to the question was based on information provided by his department. The department has since advised the minister that the visit that occurred on 16 November 2009 was not a maintenance inspection but an investigation undertaken as part of a program to test the chemical composition of suspected asbestos-containing material in a number of schools. As it was not a maintenance visit, the department did not think it was within the scope of the question. For the benefit of the House, I table a copy of all the correspondence in this matter.</Hansard-Body>

It is well established that there are three elements to be established when it is alleged that a member has committed the contempt of deliberately misleading the House. First, the statement must, in fact, have been misleading; secondly, it must be established that the member making the statement knew at the time the statement was made that it was incorrect; and thirdly, in making it, the member must have intended to mislead the House. It is arguable that the visit on 16 November 2009 was within the scope of the member’s question. However, it would seem the minister relied on advice from the department, which took the view that the visit fell well outside the scope of the question. It cannot be demonstrated that the minister knew that his answer could be construed as being misleading and nor can it be demonstrated that the minister intended to mislead the House. I have, therefore, decided not to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-998566"></A>
Finally, I note that in a <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 article on 26 January 2009 it was stated that the honourable member for Indooroopilly had referred the minister’s answer to the committee. This was obviously not the case. The member may well have been misquoted, but in any event I need to stress that I believe that it is inappropriate for members to make complaints and then advise the media of the complaint. It is discourteous to me as Speaker, the committee and to the whole House. I would urge all members to follow proper process and make complaints either in this House or to me pursuant to standing orders, but in any case refrain from making a complaint and then advising the media that a complaint has been made.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): As I have said many times in this House, the establishment of a new liquefied natural gas industry in Queensland is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our state. The simple fact is that liquid natural gas will represent a massive boost to our economy. This new industry has the potential to create at least 18,000 jobs and we are on track to see the first shipments in 2012. Most of these jobs will be in the Gladstone region, but several thousand positions will also be created in the Surat Basin. Today, at a special function in Parliament House I will meet some of the young people who stand to benefit from the development of this region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998646"></A>
Today, we will launch the expansion of a scheme that will see thousands of these students given the opportunity to be trained for this industry at schools throughout the Surat Basin region. The Queensland Minerals and Energy high school program is a partnership between the Department of Education and Training, the Queensland Resources Council and training and education providers. I first launched this scheme as education minister in 2005, when Queensland was experiencing a skills shortage in our minerals and energy sector. The academy partnership commenced in 18 Queensland schools at the start of 2006 in the Mount Isa, Gladstone and Moranbah regions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998655"></A>
Today, I can announce that, from the start of the 2010 school year, seven new Surat Basin high schools will offer education and training options for students interested in resource sector careers. That means that more than 4,350 high school students at Roma, Chinchilla, Dalby, Toowoomba, Oakey and Pittsworth state high schools and Downlands College in Toowoomba will have the opportunity to focus their education on the rapidly expanding coal seam gas industry. By 2012 it is estimated that there will be nearly 500 students from these schools who will have participated in the new curriculum. Students will choose from four different pathways: a plant operator, a trade qualification, an advanced diploma level traineeship in electrical or mechanical engineering, or towards a professional engineering degree. In each case a resource company will support them with field trips, excursions, work experience, school based apprenticeships and other learning support. I would like to thank the three companies sponsoring this part of the program--Origin Energy, QGC and Santos--for their significant vote of confidence in the region and, importantly, their $1.3 million investment in this scheme over the next three years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998668"></A>
I think we would all agree that for a long time now the Surat Basin has produced such talented young people for export. Certainly, in recent decades this region routinely lost its best and brightest to career opportunities outside the region. I believe that the skilled workforce that we need to make this industry thrive is just as important as the resource in the ground. This scheme will give the young people of the Surat Basin the skills that they need to grab this local opportunity with both hands.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Sir Leo Hielscher</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001061"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): Members may have noticed that we have a very special guest in our gallery this morning. It is with great pleasure that I welcome Sir Leo Hielscher, and members of his family, the former Under Treasurer of Queensland and inaugural and current chair of the Queensland Treasury Corporation. I think all members in this chamber and many, many Queenslanders will be aware of the remarkable contribution that Sir Leo has made to the development of Queensland. Indeed, his name, the name Hielscher, is synonymous with the growth and prosperity of our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001062"></A>
It is therefore with a sense of history, of a chapter drawing to a close, that I report to the House that Sir Leo Hielscher has advised the Treasurer and me that he will not seek reappointment to the role of chair of the QTC when his current term expires on 30 June. It is, however, with pleasure that I note that he will be taking up a new role with the QTC which the Treasurer will outline in more detail in a moment. I can say it was with some reluctance that the Treasurer and I accepted Sir Leo Hielscher’s decision, but if anyone deserves retirement I think it is Sir Leo. It is hard to think of anyone who has worked as tirelessly as Sir Leo has for the benefit of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001063"></A>
Today I would like to take a brief opportunity to pay tribute to Sir Leo, his extraordinary career and the remarkable contribution he has made to our state. Sir Leo began his career in the State Audit Office in 1942 as a very fresh-faced 15-year-old. He was soon whisked away by the Royal Australian Air Force as part of the British Commonwealth occupying force to Japan at the end of the Second World War, thereby beginning a lifelong relationship with the people of Japan that has stood Queensland in very good stead during his career. During his time in Japan Sir Leo picked up what he likes to call some soldier’s Japanese. For those who have travelled to Tokyo with Sir Leo as I have, and met with Japanese bankers, we all know that these language skills have stood him in very good stead and helped build many enduring relationships. However, Sir Leo would be the first to concede that some of the Japanese he learnt while undertaking military duties was not always suitable for the boardrooms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001064"></A>
Upon his return to Brisbane and the Audit Office in 1947 Sir Leo restarted a career within government that would see him serve as Under Treasurer of Queensland for 14 years from 1974 to 1988. During his time as Under Treasurer, Sir Leo’s vision and hard work delivered much prosperity throughout Queensland. Just a few of his achievements include the establishment of Gladstone as an industrial and resources hub; negotiating key contracts with mining companies to secure royalties for the Queensland taxpayer; facilitating the development of Griffith University, the casino industry in Queensland, the Queensland cultural centre and the Hay Point and Dalrymple Bay coal terminals; the development of the Queensland government fully funded public superannuation scheme; and, of course, the establishment of the Queensland Treasury Corporation, Queensland’s stand-alone financing authority, where Sir Leo has served as chair with great distinction since QTC’s inception 22 years ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001065"></A>
I think anyone who knows Sir Leo knows that this is a man who absolutely loves Queensland. His passion for our state is legendary and it is infectious. As QTC chair he has always been generous with his time and ever ready to share his knowledge, experience and wisdom. On a personal note today, I want to take the opportunity to say how deeply grateful I am to him for the many insights that he shared with me during the time that I was Treasurer. I am sure I speak for all who have had the honour of being the Treasurer of Queensland during Sir Leo’s stewardship in acknowledging what a great debt each of us owe personally to Sir Leo for his tireless assistance with our many duties--sometimes accompanied by a very fine scotch. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001066"></A>
Very fittingly, Sir Leo has been honoured far and wide for his contribution to Queensland and the economy, and is greatly respected on both sides of politics and in financial markets around the world. Sir Leo, at the young age of 83, has in the last 12 months still been travelling for the QTC in financial markets around the world. He was awarded an Eisenhower Fellowship in 1973, a Knight Bachelor in 1987, an Honorary Doctorate of Griffith University in 1993 and a Companion in the Order of Australia (AC) in the General Division in 2004. I was very pleased to see him honoured as a Queensland Great in 2007. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001067"></A>
It is for these reasons that today I am very pleased to announce a further fitting tribute to emphasise the role that Sir Leo has played in Queensland’s economic development. It was Sir Leo who drove the planning, the financing and the construction of the first Gateway Bridge in the early 1980s. Indeed, the prosperity that followed this bridge could be said, I think, to be one of Sir Leo’s crowning glories. Financing of this bridge was a herculean effort and some of the stories that surround it could fill a book, although I am sure Sir Leo will keep some of them to himself. As the House is well aware, my government is currently investing a further $1.88 billion in the construction of a duplicate bridge to cater for the needs of a growing state. It is therefore with great pleasure that I advise the House that the government will rename the gateway precinct the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, recognising Sir Leo’s contribution to Queensland. If anyone deserves two bridges named after them I think it is Sir Leo Hielscher, a remarkable man and a great Queenslander. Sir Leo, on behalf of a very grateful state, I thank you for your unrivalled contribution to Queensland and I wish you and Lady Mary every happiness in your retirement.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Sir Leo Hielscher, Motion to Take Note</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001070"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.45 am): Shortly after arrival on level 9 in the Executive Building, I dutifully received the chairman of the Queensland Treasury Corporation. Sir Leo Hielscher walked through the door of the Treasurer’s office as he had done a thousand times before. As ever, it was with a trademark cheeky grin and the optimism of a man who had long since figured out much of what life is and should be about. Of course, we had met before, but that day was different. Sir Leo is quite particular about everything that happens on level 9. He managed to mention fairly quickly that he was responsible for the construction of the Executive Building and then we sat down and he put me in my place--and that was at No. 15. I was, Sir Leo quickly informed me, the 15th Treasurer whom he had served. In that one fact alone we can see the breadth of Sir Leo Hielscher’s contribution to our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001071"></A>
Last month Sir Leo came back through that same door with the letter I knew he had put off writing and which he knew I had put off receiving. It included a paragraph that, even on its 10th read, remains hard to believe. He wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001072"></A>
With somewhat of a heavy heart, I advise that I will not be seeking reappointment as Chairman of the Board. I joined the Queensland Public Service in 1942 and 68 years later I am writing this ‘request to retire’ letter--46 of those years have been in the three senior positions in Treasury, 10 as Deputy Under Treasurer, 14 as Under Treasurer and 22 as Chairman of QTC.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001073"></A>
It was vintage Sir Leo, dutiful and gigantic, a servant of the public who by himself proves that the terms ‘public service’ and ‘public servant’ are noble, not pejorative, terms; a servant who after a massive 68 years writes not to inform the government of the day of his retirement but to request it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001074"></A>
As the Premier said, there are few who are more deserving of the granting of such a request. It is appropriate that on the occasion of the announcement of his retirement as the chair, it is the Parliament of Queensland that provides the forum, for Sir Leo has served both sides of politics with distinction. In fact, the politics never much mattered; it was the policy and the people of Queensland that mattered much more. It is the people of Queensland who will long benefit from his foresight and, frankly, his toughness. Leo knew that holding the line was a lonely job, but just like his favoured Macallans it begins to really be worth it about 21 years after the fact. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001075"></A>
His achievements are many and all deserve recognition today. The city of Gladstone largely owes its modern prosperity to the man, as does the rapid development of the coal industry more generally. The preservation of the Old Treasury and the concurrent development of the casino industry are also notable. The massive and unique achievement of fully funding the state’s long-term superannuation and employee liabilities was a world first when first achieved and remains, to the best of our knowledge, unique today. And trust me, Sir Leo has searched the world high and low and not yet found our peer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001076"></A>
For all his generosity of spirit the man was and is a tough and determined force. There remains across this earth many a former and present coal executive who ended up on the wrong side of a Sir Leo negotiation. However, in Sir Leo’s recollection, the coal companies were always a winner. As he says, they all agreed in the end, so the deal must have been worthwhile. At a 10 per cent royalty, it is Sir Leo’s considered view that they are doing all right; they get the other 90 per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002154"></A>
He built and financed Dalrymple Bay with the sort of fundamental foresight that modern mercantilists simultaneously romanticise and decry. They pine for capacity investment ahead of the curve and moan about the reality of the cost. Sir Leo knew about risk taking and the price to be paid--the price that would be paid by those coal companies who sat it out and who had to pay up as Leo’s acumen paid long-term, long-tail dividends to the state. It seems that the more things change, the more things stay the same. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002157"></A>
His approach was always tough, and for the future. He was never afraid to take them on in pursuit of the state’s long-term interests. It is an instructive and valued perspective today. The wisdom of this approach was imparted early, and unambiguously, to me. There is no doubt, however, that his crowning achievement was, as the Premier said, the establishment and subsequent chairmanship of Queensland Treasury Corporation. It was at its establishment ahead of its time. During its 22 years Sir Leo is and will remain until 30 June its only chairman. He established QTC with Stephen Rochester as its first CEO. Stephen remains CEO today. Stability has been their catchcry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002158"></A>
I also inform the House today that the government has resolved to appoint Mr Rochester to succeed Sir Leo, from 1 September this year. I congratulate him on his appointment. Stephen will step down as CEO to take up this appointment, and an international recruitment exercise will now commence to secure a new, the second, CEO of the Queensland Treasury Corporation. There is no doubt that Stephen is uniquely placed to fulfil the role of chairman. He is equally well known to the market place and the international investment community. I know that Stephen regards this as a high honour and also I know that he will acquit himself well as chairman of an organisation he has served since its inception.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002159"></A>
Sir Leo in deciding to step down as chairman has, however, offered to continue to serve the people of Queensland in whatever capacity he can. Accordingly, I am pleased to also advise the House that he will continue with QTC as Foundation Chairman in an advisory role. The state of Queensland has been fortunate to have enjoyed the service of Sir Leo and can look forward still to his wisdom and international reputation being applied to the benefit of the state into the future. It is often said of a certain former Premier that he was not necessarily liked but at least he got things done. Well, the bloke who in fact got most of those things done is sitting in the gallery here today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002160"></A>
I can think of no better recognition of Sir Leo’s contribution than the Premier’s announcement that the Gateway bridges upon completion will be named in his honour. These towering engineering achievements that are the Gateway bridges perfectly symbolise the achievements of Sir Leo Hielscher. The first bridge also represents perhaps Sir Leo’s finest hour. It was--many will be stunned to hear--our first PPP. It is, however, for Sir Leo--and he alone--to give the full details of that legendary tale. There is probably not anyone who has contributed more and influenced more the course of our state than Sir Leo Hielscher. No university has yet been built in his name and no placard waved nor burnt. But, as the Premier said, if anyone deserved two bridges named after him, it is Sir Leo. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002161"></A>
Sir Leo celebrated his birthday during our last investor roadshow. After we addressed the dinner for the assembled bankers at Tokyo’s Imperial Hotel, the team was invited by Sir Leo for a drink to celebrate what he insisted we refer to as his 38th birthday. He told us he was also looking forward to his 48th birthday this year. As so many Treasurers and Treasury officials have experienced before, one is not so much invited for a drink but expected to attend. It is never a burden, however. That night, Sir Leo was, as ever, in a generous mood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002162"></A>
From a hotel built across from the gardens where the young uniformed Hielscher patrolled as part of the occupying forces after the Second World War, Sir Leo toured the world and his lifetime over a drink. He should write a book--and I am glad that he is. A dominant part of his story has been his family--his wife, Lady Mary, their children and their grandchildren. His devotion to Mary is well known, and is in fact on display today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002163"></A>
In that first meeting back in September 2007 Sir Leo, with his usual wink and cheeky grin, put his hand on my arm and said, ‘Now “15”, as I’ve told you I’ve worked for a few Treasurers--and they’ve all been good. But some have been better than others.’ Sir Leo has been well placed, uniquely placed, to form such judgements. I understand my place in that queue. I realise the size of the footsteps I am walking in. And, Leo: I remain determined to honour your work. I thank you personally for your advice and for your mateship.</Hansard-Body>

By the accident of time it just so happens that it falls to me on this day to help record our formal gratitude to a man who has authored much of the story of the development of our state. I cannot pretend to speak for all of my predecessors, but I will speak for the officers of the Treasury Leo helped build. We are honoured by your leadership and your stewardship. It is has been my rare privilege to work with Sir Leo. Today I pay tribute to his contribution to our state. I pay tribute to Sir Leo--the man. I pay tribute to Sir Leo--the institution. And I invite honourable members to do so also. I move--</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (9.54 am): Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this motion. I note the comments of the Premier and the Treasurer. I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Sir Leo Hielscher. He is one of the great public servants of Queensland, ranking with luminaries such as Sir David Longland and Sir JD Storey. He epitomises the public servants’ credo that many of us hear about--and that is frank and fearless advice. There is no doubt that politicians at times focus on the short term and someone like Sir Leo has clearly, by the example of his service having served for more than five decades, shown that he is focused on the long term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002171"></A>
He has served successive governments on both sides with great professionalism, and his apprentices have provided the senior ranks of the Queensland Treasury department for years. It is a credit to him, when I look at his record that was just provided to me as I came into this House, that he served as an entrepreneurial and future focused Under Treasurer from 1974 to 1988. Apart from a short period in the mid-1990s, we have had a very long Labor administration since 1989 which is a contrast to the first administration that he served in from 1974 to 1988. It is a credit to Sir Leo that he has not been politicised and there has never been any question about whether he has been politicised but that he really has provided frank and fearless advice to governments of both sides. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002173"></A>
He has had the capacity to identify and raid hollow logs for many years in order to satisfy the immediate financial concerns of the government. He was extremely innovative in working with the former member for Lilley, Kevin Cairns, in ensuring that Queensland was able to receive additional payments from the Commonwealth to raise Queensland’s service standards through the Commonwealth Grants Commission. In his role as Chairman of the Queensland Treasury Corporation, he has raised Queensland’s profile across the world. His word is his bond in international financial circles. I read with interest the details of the Premier’s and Treasurer’s fundraising trips overseas where Sir Leo Hielscher has been an important, integral part. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002176"></A>
Of course as a loyal public servant he has never divulged when his political masters have failed to heed his advice. I think it is important to note that it always has been advice. I do not think Sir Leo would claim credit for the policies that have made this state the great state that it is. He would give the credit to his political masters of both sides. I think that it is important to acknowledge that, while he has provided the advice, it is the politicians, the people who have led this state, who have then put those policies--some of which have been accepted but obviously not all--into action that has led to the state that we now have. It has clearly been transformed from an immature rural economy and Sir Leo has been acknowledged as the architect of the modern Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002177"></A>
I note his list of career highlights that were mentioned by the Premier which include influencing the growth of Queensland’s coal and aluminium industries and developing the royalties structure that the Treasurer referred to; helping to develop the Queensland sugar industry and its infrastructure; researching and developing the financial and operational structure for the introduction of casinos; facilitating the funding for the original Gateway Bridge--and we congratulate him on the tribute that has been accorded him by the Premier in naming the Gateway bridges after Sir Leo--developing the state’s acclaimed fully funded public superannuation approach; and founding the Queensland Treasury Corporation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002181"></A>
The LNP wishes Sir Leo the very best in his new endeavours as Foundation Chairman in an advisory role with the QTC. I think it is also interesting to note that, whilst the Treasurer and the Premier spoke of his age, it just shows the ageism that seems to abound in modern Australian society that our cricketers and footballers should retire at 30, but that is clearly something that need not apply in politics. The wisdom that comes with age is epitomised by Sir Leo and other public servants like him. I am happy to speak to this motion and pass on the congratulations of the LNP, the opposition in this state. We wish him the best and we thank him for his dedication as a true public servant. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.58 am): I support the motion moved by my colleague the Treasurer. Sir Leo’s career started in the days of economic giants like HC Coombs and Colin Clark. He has served successive governments with distinction, courtesy and good humour. He was there when the coal and aluminium industries were born, raised and grown. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002225"></A>
In a game where finance needs stability, certainty and continuity, he has worked with all of us with passion but without partisanship, with good counsel but without cajoling. I welcome the decision to name the Gateway bridges in his honour. As the Gateway Bridge itself is built on the bedrock that underlies this great city, this great state is built on the bedrock of Sir Leo’s vision, drive and diligence. When people in the years and decades to come drive over this wonderful colossus, I would ask that they spare a thought for the man who underlies and underpins the economic development and the construction of not only that infrastructure but so much other infrastructure that this great state is developed upon. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 You can get the vacuum cleaner salesman to do yours. We speak often in this parliament about how vital our doctors, nurses and allied health professionals are in the health system. Indeed, they are the front line of care and often the first face we see when we are at our most vulnerable. But the treatment our staff provide, the lives they save and the miracles they perform every day would not be possible if it were not for those researchers who develop those treatments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002243"></A>
The Bligh government is making an unprecedented investment in Queensland research--approximately $47 million last financial year. Queensland has been the home of a number of significant breakthroughs in the past couple of years, including the groundbreaking cervical cancer vaccine. The investigations and discovery our researchers begin today will save the lives of Queenslanders and help improve the quality of those lives in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002244"></A>
We have made public health system advances by listening to the best of the best in research, education and training. Passion for finding the answer to fundamental and clinical science questions can reduce complications and patient stays in hospital. As a result, more patients can be treated. Research discoveries have direct implications in slowing disease onset and progression. What is particularly special about this type of investment is that it is not like new equipment or infrastructure; we are actually investing in ideas and endeavours.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002245"></A>
Research and professional training is the best investment we can make to strengthen clinical standards and build capacity in our hospitals. Too many Queenslanders die prematurely from preventable diseases each year, like obesity, smoking and excess drinking. If prevention is the key, medical science and research is the doorway to better health. Advances in medical research lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of preventable diseases. This, in turn, can help slow the spread of chronic disease and, through better health outcomes, give people the option to keep working in their 60s and 70s.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002246"></A>
Let us not forget the importance of medical research to the economy. Access Economics says medical research returns to the Australian economy an average of $2--and up to $6--for every $1 spent. Australian health and related development expenditure between 1992 and 2004 was estimated to return over $29 billion. This investment outperformed returns from manufacturing and agricultural sectors. These studies and reports demonstrate the returns that come in the form of savings through reduced incidence of disease.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002247"></A>
I have spoken often in this House about the changing nature of our health demographics. As our life expectancy continues to climb, we are no longer dying from things like heart attacks and strokes in the numbers that we did in the past. As our population ages, we are seeing a rise in the incidence of cancers as well as an increase in diseases that traditionally affect the elderly, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s, and the additional pressure on this end of the health system. That is why research, particularly in these areas, will be fundamental. I will give one example: it is estimated that the ability to reduce Alzheimer’s disease by five per cent through Australian research and development will produce savings of around $10.3 billion by 2050.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002248"></A>
The Bligh government’s investment in research is not just an investment in jobs, it is not just an investment in health and it is not just an investment in a strong skills base; it is an investment in our future. The research answers we discover today will save lives tomorrow. <Hansard-Speech-End>

ICT Contractor Engagement Model</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002251"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.04 am): After extensive consultation between the government’s Chief Procurement Office and the ICT Industry Workgroup--which included representatives from the Australian Information Industry Association and the Information Technology Contract and Recruitment Association--agreement has been reached on the new whole-of-government contractor engagement model. I would like to congratulate the Chief Procurement Office and the ICT Industry Workgroup representatives on their professionalism and diligence in making this a reality.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002255"></A>
The government will not develop its own contractor resource pool but will continue to access the skills required from industry through the resource manager. The resource manager will be responsible for establishing clear and transparent protocols for managing recruitment agency requests for contractor placements, levels of payment, skills required, contractor management and performance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002256"></A>
The Chief Procurement Office will be responsible for monitoring the success of the model and will have key performance indicators in place to ensure ongoing effectiveness. Both industry and the government acknowledge that savings will be made by this whole-of-government approach and I will be reporting back to parliament on these figures. At the same time, the CPO will receive ongoing feedback on the model through the establishment of a joint government and advisory group. This group will also ensure the requirements for transparency, accountability and efficiency are met while protecting the commercial interests of contractors and their employers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002257"></A>
The benefits of this new model include: reducing the cost of engaging ICT contractors, as well as obtaining more competitive daily rates for contractors; a more transparent engagement process, which includes simpler and standardised processes and contracts; improved visibility of all government expenditure and transactions on ICT contractors; an improved performance framework that will track and manage the performance of all ICT contractors; and increasing the opportunity for the local ICT industry--including small and medium enterprises--to work for the government provided they meet the established performance and capability criteria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002258"></A>
The Chief Procurement Office has developed an overview of the model which has been distributed to agencies and the ICT industry so that they can fully appreciate the changes taking place. I look forward to these changes and again thank the CPO and representatives from the AIIA and ITCRA for their valuable input into this new contractor engagement model. I note that the policy-free shadow spokesman criticised this initiative, as indeed she does every positive step we take in ICT policy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Fire Safety Standards, Budget Accommodation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002261"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.07 am): Queenslanders will recall the terrible tragedy at the Palace Backpackers Hostel in Childers on 23 June 2000 which claimed the lives of 15 people. Following that tragedy, the Labor government introduced legislation which included tough fire safety standards for both new and existing budget accommodation buildings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002262"></A>
The tragedy and impacts of the Childers fire continue to resonate throughout the community and the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service. Over the three years between 1 January 2007 and 1 February 2010, the Fire and Rescue Service inspected 770 newly identified and unregistered student and backpacker accommodation buildings. Of the 770 buildings identified, 356 were issued with section 69 requisitions to reduce occupancy numbers to below six persons until the building complied with the fire safety standards, and 139 were issued with section 104G notices to upgrade existing fire safety systems to comply with the fire safety standard. It is obvious that a number of operators are not taking these laws seriously. They are putting profit before the safety of their tenants.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002263"></A>
The government takes this issue very seriously. That is why I am announcing today a departmental review of the current working arrangements for the inspection and enforcement regime for budget accommodation. Representatives from the departments of infrastructure and planning and communities and the Local Government Association will be invited to participate, along with representatives from local councils. The terms of reference for the review include: an assessment of the current process for identifying unregistered budget accommodation; identification of potential additional strategies for identifying unregistered budget accommodation; and assessment of the adequacy of the current enforcement and penalty regime.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002264"></A>
Queensland already has some of the toughest budget accommodation legislation in the country. I want this review to ensure our current laws and our inspection regime send a clear message to unscrupulous operators that unsafe premises will not be tolerated. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.09 am): Australia’s largest road infrastructure project is now more than one-third complete. More than 5.3 million hours have been worked on the $4.8 billion Airport Link, the Northern Busway from Windsor to Kedron, and the airport roundabout upgrade. Close to 2,400 people are currently employed at nine major sites across the northern suburbs on the projects that will generate a total of 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. That is a huge economic boost from the Bligh government on a congestion-busting project that will reduce peak-hour traffic on Lutwyche Road by up to 40 per cent, put in place 25 bridges, 15 kilometres of tunnels and seven kilometres of new roads complete with bus and transit lanes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003555"></A>
Construction on this scale, however, has never been seen before and there is no doubt that it is impacting on local communities, as my local colleagues, the members for Brisbane Central and Clayfield, could attest. However, the state government is doing everything it can to minimise these impacts. On Saturday I again visited a number of residents to hear their concerns and will continue to do so. Mitigation measures such as house cleaning, air conditioning and temporary relocation have been offered to residents to make their lives more comfortable. This, too, will continue. It is important to note that the alternative to the Airport Link was the northern transportation corridor--a freeway which would have wiped out entire suburbs. It was an above-ground freeway that would have seen huge numbers of homes raised. Instead, the Bligh government decided to go underground. To progress tunnelling, the first two massive tunnel-boring machines, or TBMs--the largest on any Australian project--are now being assembled. An additional 16 road headers--the largest number used on an Australian project--have tunnelled more than two kilometres from sites at Bowen Hills, Lutwyche and Kedron. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003560"></A>
I respectfully want to thank the people of Brisbane for their ongoing patience. In addition to the 10,000 jobs, the three combined Airport Link projects will deliver more than 13 kilometres of new or improved cycleways and pathways, three hectares of new parkland and one million plants including more than 5,400 mature trees. The Airport Link project will remove 18 sets of traffic lights and slash driving times in metropolitan Brisbane, which is currently experiencing some of Australia’s worst peak-hour traffic. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.11 am): The Bligh government has significantly beefed up its capability to investigate and take action against environmental offences by companies and individuals. Unlike those opposite, we take the Nature Conservation Act, Vegetation Management Act and the Environmental Protection Act seriously. Through the creation of the Department of Environment and Resource Management last year, we now have a stronger, more integrated compliance unit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003570"></A>
In this financial year so far in the environment portfolio alone the department has already successfully prosecuted 15 charges, with several more expected to be finalised in coming months. This financial year there has also been an increase in charges laid. Charges have been laid against 16 defendants for alleged breaches of the environmental legislation. This is more than the total number of defendants for the whole of last year. The number of serious cases we are prosecuting is also increasing. Last year there were two matters involving three charges where a jail term could be imposed totalling 12 years maximum. This year, however, there are seven matters involving 37 charges where a jail term could be imposed. This adds up to a total of 66 years--a fivefold increase in maximum prison time that could be served for breaches to environmental law in Queensland. Last year the total maximum fines for charges laid totalled $4.6 million compared to this year, which could be as high as $11.3 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003571"></A>
There are three significant current environmental prosecutions expected to be finalised by the end of this year as well. Two have already pleaded guilty. One involves over 80 charges against three defendants, and a penalty of up to $225,000 will be sought as well as jail time. We have also carried out more than 280 inspections and audits on business premises so far this year. The department through a range of measures has significantly increased its presence as an environmental regulator, and this government through significantly increasing its staffing and resources is doing its job to enforce the environmental laws here in Queensland and to protect our environment. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.14 am): Construction of housing in remote Indigenous communities has been fast-tracked as a result of last year’s opening of the $32 million remote land tenure and infrastructure program office, which we all just call the program office, in Cairns last year. In particular, I would like to make mention of Woorabinda, where surveying of 13 blocks was completed last month and construction is expected to begin on 14 new dwellings next month. Surveying for Aurukun, Kowanyama and Napranum is currently being organised. As well as housing, we will be working to improve essential infrastructure including water systems, sewerage systems, electricity networks and roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003575"></A>
All of this work translates to more than 2,200 jobs for local people. These projects will boost employment opportunities for local tradespeople, apprentices and those who want to start various training programs. Professional services will also be required. That means engineering jobs, surveying jobs, town planning jobs and opportunities for building companies from key regional centres like Cairns and Townsville. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003577"></A>
The program office opened last year is the first of its kind in Australia, with a mission to plan, build and deliver for Queensland’s remote Indigenous communities. The office will cut through red tape, and sort out land tenure and town planning to enable this huge building program. Previously, sorting out land issues was one of the key problems holding back the building program in Indigenous communities. I am pleased to announce that, since the opening of this office, nine Indigenous councils have signed up to the 40-year social housing leases that will allow the rollout of more than $300 million of state and federal government funding to build houses and infrastructure in Queensland’s Indigenous communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003580"></A>
The program office will work closely with traditional owners, the community and local councils to get the housing mix right, to build homes that are suitable as well as upgrading and refurbishing existing homes. There is a lot of hard work and planning ahead including the development of land use plans, surveying networks, township based Indigenous land use agreements, construction schedules for social housing and associated infrastructure, and training and employment strategies for the local workforce. Land tenure and town planning are long overdue, but the Bligh government is resolving these issues and delivering a better future for Queensland’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Gulf Region, Approval of Exceptional Circumstances Assistance</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003584"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.16 am): Yesterday afternoon we received the excellent news that the federal government’s exceptional circumstances support has been approved for producers in the gulf region. I want to publicly recognise the efforts of the Queensland government staff, the Northern Gulf Resource Management Group--in particular, Noeline Gross--and gulf producers who worked on the application for EC. The application required detailed information on flood impacts and the cooperation of the majority of producers. I congratulate everyone who was involved.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003587"></A>
The member for Mount Isa, Betty Kiernan, also deserves a special mention. She is always a strong advocate for the area and this issue was no exception. This was a historic application. EC assistance is usually only approved following a rare and severe drought. But we are applying for assistance following the prolonged heavy flooding caused by tropical Cyclone Charlotte in early 2009 which resulted in conditions just like a severe drought. Tens of thousands of kilometres of pasture were destroyed by prolonged inundation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003590"></A>
The standard freight subsidy and loan assistance under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements were supplemented with fodder drops and $15,000 grants. The Northern Gulf Resource Management Group also provided Landcare grants of a similar size, but it was clear to us that this was a one in 25-year event that should also qualify for EC. The combination of heavy stock losses, particularly calves, and the destruction of pasture, means that local producers’ incomes will be severely impacted for years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003593"></A>
Queensland government pasture scientists believe that the seed beds on the clay plains of the northern Gulf Country may have been destroyed, which will delay recovery. Last November the National Rural Advisory Council indicated that it did not believe all producers within the boundary we submitted would meet EC criteria. We did not give up. We immediately sent an officer down to Canberra for talks and quickly submitted adjusted boundaries. With the EC application now approved, producers can apply through Centrelink for income support and can contact QRAA to access assistance with interest costs. I urge producers to do so as soon as possible.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.19 am): The Bligh government is committed to creating and supporting Queensland jobs. To keep Queensland growing we need to ensure we have a skilled workforce as the economy recovers from the global financial crisis. Young people were amongst those most vulnerable to the effects of the economic downturn and the Bligh government has stepped up to ensure these workers are protected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006029"></A>
We introduced a range of initiatives to not only provide new job opportunities for our young people but also help keep them in trades and traineeships as apprentice uptake dropped due to the GFC. The pre-apprenticeship training program launched by the Premier last year has allowed us to ensure young people are not lost to trades by the lack of available opportunities. Under the program, prospective apprentices received upfront training to make them job ready ahead of the economic recovery. I am pleased to announce today that we are already seeing the benefits of this innovative program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006031"></A>
We have so far provided funding for 2,000 apprentices and trainees to undertake this program, which was announced in August last year, and already more than 1,500 people have applied. Many of these young people are already undertaking introductory training with a registered training organisation before starting an apprenticeship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006032"></A>
As we know, the global financial crisis resulted in major job losses in many industries, with construction, engineering and tourism hardest hit. This resulted in a significant decline in apprenticeships. We wanted to ensure that young people were not walking away from trades because they believed there were no jobs in the longer term. We took steps to ensure apprenticeships were still attractive; otherwise we faced losing these people forever. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006033"></A>
Under the new model, prospective apprentices are receiving intensive trade related preparatory training, green and employability skills development, workplace simulation and vocational placement training. To make sure they are gaining the skills employers need them to have, we have worked closely with industry and the unions to set up customised industry based models. The training is being delivered outside an employment contract entirely by registered training organisations. Five RTOs have now been awarded contracts with some already beginning programs. A further five applications are currently under review. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006034"></A>
Apprentices win because they can undertake bulk training to get them job ready, and employers win because the duration of apprenticeships is reduced. On the completion of the pre-apprenticeship training, participants will be able to register their details on the Out-of-Trade Register to connect with potential employers to take them on to a fully fledged apprenticeship. We have received great industry support for this program, and by working together we know that we can continue to create more opportunities for Queenslanders. Innovative solutions such as the institutional pre-apprenticeship training model are helping to put Queensland in the front seat as the world and domestic economies recover. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.22 am): The Queensland government’s Wild River Rangers Program continues to expand, with seven new rangers starting this year. These rangers are working across the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York to look after Queensland’s wild rivers. The job of the rangers is to keep these rivers pristine by preventing wildfires, invasive weeds and feral animals, land disturbance, rubbish and water pollution. As well as addressing issues in the wild river catchments, the program supports the generation of sustainable employment through an intensive mentoring model.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006040"></A>
The qualifications these rangers receive as a result of this program are nationally recognised and transferrable. The state government is committed to the employment of up to 100 wild river rangers across Queensland. Jimmy Richards, a well-known Ewamian traditional owner from the Gulf of Carpentaria, was appointed recently as a ranger coordinator working in the eastern Staaten River catchment. Another two Ewamian rangers have just started with him this month. I look forward to meeting Jimmy Richards and his wild river ranger team when I am next in the gulf. A further two rangers have just commenced at Injinoo, in the northern peninsula area, and another two at Cardwell working with Girringun. Three more wild river ranger positions will be filled on a seasonal and flexible basis across several other communities, and these positions will be filled by June.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006041"></A>
This new intake is part of a state government commitment to invest an additional $5 million over four years to employ, train and support new wild river rangers. The Indigenous rangers have been employed to work with landholders, communities and traditional owners to protect and promote the state’s declared wild river systems. The Wild River Rangers Program helps to preserve centuries of cultural knowledge by ensuring these skills are handed down to the next generation. These people are learning real skills that lead to real jobs in the real economy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.24 am): The Bligh government is working hard to create jobs for Queenslanders, to help keep our economy strong. But today I wanted to pay tribute to a particular group of people who make a very important contribution to our state--and they do it for free. Our foster carers perform one of the most important jobs in our community--caring for children who can no longer live at home. These carers open their homes and their hearts to children who have been neglected or abused. They do not receive a salary to perform this role, just an allowance to cover general costs. But they take on this responsibility because they are motivated to help others.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006046"></A>
We need more people like this to support our most vulnerable children. That is why the Bligh government is running a major recruitment and training campaign for foster and kinship carers. I am pleased to report that this campaign is delivering great results. We have more than doubled our original target of recruiting 500 new carers, with a total of more than 1,000 people coming on board. It is great to see that our investment in this campaign is paying off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006047"></A>
Our government is committed to ensuring Queenslanders who volunteer to help our vulnerable children receive all the support and training they need. We have committed more than $128 million in the current budget to support foster carers across the state. We also continue to support individual volunteer organisations who work with children in care, such as the Pyjama Foundation. The foundation is made up of more than 1,000 volunteers, known as ‘Pyjama angels’, who read and play educational literacy games with children in care every week. Our government has provided more than $200,000 to the foundation this year, because we know that their work is helping to give vulnerable children a flying start in life. Just as our government continues to work hard to create jobs and build our economy, we will also continue to support organisations and their volunteers who go out of their way to help others in need. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.26 am): The Bligh government is getting on with the job of delivering better services for Queenslanders with a disability. From Cairns to Mackay, through to Hervey Bay and the Sunshine Coast, we are creating a caring and inclusive Queensland. We are giving vulnerable Queenslanders and their families the care and support they need to live productive and rewarding lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006053"></A>
When I visited Cairns in January, I announced $250,000 in funding to move four Far North Queenslanders with a disability from Cairns Base Hospital into purpose-built accommodation in Gordonvale. This is a great outcome for those people and their families. It will not only ensure that they get the specialised care they need but also mean freeing up hospital beds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006054"></A>
In Cairns I also announced an extra $203,000 to support Far North Queensland school leavers. These funds will benefit 16 local school leavers like Kylie Hoffman, who I met at Arc Disability Services in Cairns. A total of 290 Queensland school leavers will benefit from increased job opportunities, care and support under this $4 million state-wide program, including Aaron Young, whom I met in Mackay last month.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006055"></A>
The Minister for Community Services and Housing is not the only one who is committed to social housing. When I visited Hervey Bay in January, I announced $4 million to fund purpose-built disability housing in the Bundaberg-Wide Bay region. It means accommodation for 28 people in purpose-built and modified buildings--people like Jozes Graca, who was overjoyed and over the moon to be moving into his new duplex in Hervey Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006056"></A>
It gave me great pleasure in January to open the newly refurbished SPIRAL day respite centre at Nambour with the member for Nicklin. The Bligh and Rudd governments contributed $800,000 towards the refurbishment of the centre, which is a vital asset to the local community. It will mean better services for people with a disability, while giving local carers and families a well-earned break. Queenslanders with a disability and their families can count on the Bligh government to deliver the care and support they need, no matter where they live in Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (10.31 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. When Labor’s Gordon Nuttall told mistruths to state parliament, the Premier changed the rules to make that legal. When Labor’s Terry Mackenroth cost taxpayers $4.3 million, the Premier said that he could be reappointed. Now that Mike Kaiser has taken on a half a million dollar job against the code of conduct, the Premier is about to make that legal, and I ask: will the Premier level with Queenslanders and reveal what Labor mates Gordon Nuttall, Terry Mackenroth and Mike Kaiser have over her that makes her dance to their tune?</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question and the opportunity that it provides for me to put some matters in relation to this issue on the public record. It seems that some people commenting on this have had a sudden rush of blood to the head. I advise members that when my former chief of staff accepted a position with the fully government owned National Broadband Network Corporation he did exactly the right thing and sought formal advice from the Integrity Commissioner on what, if any, restrictions there might be on his dealings with the Queensland government. I am very happy to table the request for advice from my former chief of staff.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009457"></A>
Indeed, I am very happy to provide copies of the advice from the Integrity Commissioner which indicates that there is nothing that would prohibit my former chief of staff from having dealings with the Queensland government on this issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007410"></A>
One of the issues in dealing with these decisions that will arise for all CEOs and for people in senior government positions and ministerial offices is how the term ‘official dealings’ should be defined. My director-general worked with the Integrity Commissioner last year to provide guidelines to CEOs and other senior officers making these decisions, and I table them for the benefit of the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009486"></A>
But I draw to the attention of the House that official dealings are considered to be specific policies, procedures, transactions, negotiations or cases in which former senior government officers previously acted for or provided advice to the government. Simply viewing documents such as cabinet submissions and decisions would not constitute having had official dealings on a matter. However, the normal confidentiality provisions would apply, and I table those for the benefit of the House. </Hansard-Body>

You have to apply common sense at the end of the day. Mr Kaiser and NBN will not be coming knocking on the Queensland government’s door to lobby us about anything; we will be going knocking on their door like every other state government to make sure that Queensland gets its share of the NBN rollout. What we have with NBN is the highways of the 21st century, and I want to make sure every Queenslander benefits wherever they are. Has Mr Kaiser done the right thing? Yes, he has. Did he seek the advice of the Integrity Commissioner? Yes, he did. He was given the right advice. He has adhered to that advice--entirely the right course of action. As I said, will he be coming lobbying us? No! If we are not there lobbying NBN, Queenslanders will miss out, and that is not going to happen on my watch.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Last November the minister issued a press release about the death of a worker installing foil insulation. The minister said that he had spoken to Peter Garrett and commented that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1007426"></A>
No other Queenslanders should have to endure the tragedy that has befallen the young installer and his family.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007427"></A>
I ask: how many Queenslanders have died since November as a result of this minister’s decision not to suspend the program, even though he knew it was already being investigated by Workplace Health and Safety and the Electrical Safety Office?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007431"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question in what is a very serious matter indeed and one that I have addressed the parliament at length on. But let me reiterate what I have said before. Before I do that, I want to express my condolences to the family of the worker who was killed in Milla Milla last week, as I have to all workers who are killed working in Queensland. This is the third incident involving insulation installers in Queensland in the past five months. Workplace Health and Safety Queensland and the Electrical Safety Office are investigating all of those incidents. I will not prejudge or predetermine any outcomes; I will let the authorities do their job free from political interference.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007435"></A>
I can advise the House that the federal environment minister, Peter Garrett, has suspended the use of foil insulation under the Home Insulation Program. That suspension, as I understand it, is effective immediately. Could I reiterate to all members that this is a federal government program. It is not administered by the state government; it is rolled out by the federal government. We have a regulatory responsibility in respect of workers working in that industry and all workers in Queensland, and that is our responsibility and one that I know officers in Workplace Health and Safety take very seriously indeed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007437"></A>
Both the federal government and the Queensland government took decisive action when the first tragedy involving an insulation installer occurred last year. After the first fatality, I issued a ministerial notice under the Electrical Safety Act 2002. I note that that is not acknowledged by members opposite. From 1 November 2009 all Queensland insulation installers have been required to comply with several important new safety conditions--safety conditions that were implemented by this government. These include the banning of metal staples when installing ceiling insulation, as well as the need for on-site risk assessments before work starts. In September 2008, and again in October and November 2009, the Electrical Safety Office wrote to all known Queensland based installers of insulation products to warn them of the dangers and remind them of their legal obligations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007439"></A>
After the second incident, the federal environment minister, Peter Garrett, announced strengthened training requirements for installers registering with the home insulation scheme--that is, they are installers registering with the federal government’s scheme. The Electrical Safety Office again distributed an alert highlighting the electrical safety issues raised by the second tragedy to all insulation installers registered with the federal home insulation scheme who undertook work in Queensland. I also instructed state authorities to conduct a state-wide blitz of insulation installers. About 500 audits have now been conducted--audits that we have implemented of our own initiative, and they will continue without let-up. Any householders with immediate electrical safety concerns about insulation in their home should contact a licensed electrician and have that addressed immediately. We have acted. We will continue to act. I will not politicise the death of workers in Queensland, but I will do my utmost to protect them.</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. The member is indeed right: on this side of the House we have a very clear jobs plan and one of the central planks of that plan is to put in place job creation schemes like our Green Army. This is a $57 million investment to create over 3,000 jobs for long-term unemployed people. I am pleased to advise the House that it is currently 10 per cent above the annual target, with 843 work placements in the first year and the first 59 projects approved. Also, 259 Green Army traineeships have been approved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007486"></A>
 I am pleased to hear about the program in Burleigh. I can also advise the member for Redcliffe that, for example, we have 15 young job seekers employed with the Redcliffe Area Youth Space, which recently launched a community recycling challenge and created a drought-resistant garden to teach the community about sustainable planting for our harsh Queensland environment. Those young people graduate tomorrow and 10 of them have already found work. These are the sorts of programs that are not only working for the young people who are in them but also delivering for the Queensland economy and for the Queensland environment. Our jobs plan and our economic strategy is working for the benefit of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007488"></A>
I have just been advised that the most recent unemployment figures have been released and I am pleased to advise the House that unemployment in Queensland has fallen again to 5.8 per cent. Members will remember that in the last month when figures were released unemployment was at 6.1 per cent. It has been revised down in retrospect today to 5.9 per cent, but it is down to 5.8 per cent. In that month we have created in Queensland 2,900 jobs. Our jobs target now is not 100,000 jobs to get; it is 94,600. We are on the way. What did we say we would do? We said we would do it job by job, community by community, industry by industry. On this side of the House we have a jobs target. Their jobs target is zero. Their jobs plan is to cut jobs. The only job that the people on the other side are interested in is their own. The only job we have heard them talk about is the job of the deputy leader. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007489"></A>
I congratulate Queensland industry and Queensland employers on the work that they are doing--taking advantage of the government programs that we have put in place, taking advantage of the chance to have their projects facilitated and to deliver jobs out there to Queenslanders. We are on track to meet our 100,000 jobs target and we will not be deterred by all the cynicism of those opposite. We care about the jobs of Queenslanders and the jobs of Queensland families, not the jobs of those who lead the rabble over there. </Hansard-Body>

Adoption Laws</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007492"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. Last year the minister introduced amendments to the adoption laws which banned same-sex couples from adopting children. The explanatory notes for that bill say that Labor’s ban on same-sex couples had nothing to do with overseas considerations and was, and I quote, ‘to safeguard the wellbeing and best interests of children’ and that ‘this ... principle must be complied with above the rights of any person wishing to adopt a child.’ Will the minister explain why Labor believes it is in the best interests of the child to ban same-sex couples from adopting children? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007499"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I would point out to this House that the opposition did not vote against the changes to the Adoption Act last year. I can only assume that that line of questioning is an attempt to politicise a debate that is currently before the House. I certainly hope that it is not the case that those opposite are trying to reverse the opportunities that the Adoption Act 2009 provides. We know that those opposite want to take the state back to the Dark Ages, but we on this side of the House are committed to a modern and progressive society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007501"></A>
The reforms of the Adoption Act, which came into effect last Monday, are the most significant reforms to the Queensland adoption laws in more than 45 years. They have modernised the laws to ensure a more open and fair process for people who are affected by adoption. We want to make sure that the wellbeing and the best interests of adopted people, both in childhood and throughout their lives, are promoted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007502"></A>
These new laws provide a balance to the right to information about birth parents or a son or daughter who was adopted with the rights for others to maintain their privacy. Previously, more than 3,000 Queenslanders affected by adoption that occurred before 1991 were prevented from obtaining identifying information about the birth parents or son or daughter who was adopted. As of last Monday that is not the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007503"></A>
The new act gives people the right to access information about their own identity or their son or daughter for the very first time. These reforms have had a 10-year journey with the adoption community, who came forward to share their personal stories with us so we could understand the bigger picture. We are very proud of these laws and what they mean to adopted people in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007504"></A>
As I said earlier, this was the most fundamental reform in 45 years. Thousands of Queenslanders affected by adoption also now have access to support, information and counselling. Last Monday we launched Queensland’s first ever funded post-adoption support service.</Hansard-Body>

 Post-adoption support services are run by the Benevolent Society.

This is just another example of how our government is supporting Queenslanders who face challenges in their lives. </Hansard-Body>

Gladstone-Fitzroy Pipeline Project</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007511"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Could the Premier inform the House of the progress of the $345 million Gladstone-Fitzroy pipeline project? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007514"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question and for his understanding of just how critical it is for water security to be delivered in Central Queensland as we see it grow and just what a great boon for jobs a project like this will be. I am pleased to advise the House that Gladstone will have an additional water source for industry, with the endorsement of the EIS for the Gladstone-Fitzroy River pipeline. The Coordinator-General has now signed off on the EIS report, recommending that the $345 million project proceed subject to conditions and federal approval. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007515"></A>
The pipeline is now a significant step closer to delivery. It will amount to approximately 200 jobs in Rockhampton and Gladstone during the construction of the project and a further 10 jobs during its operation. It is a 115-kilometre pipeline to transfer 30 gigalitres of water every year from the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton to Gladstone. The future raising of the Eden Bann Weir and the construction of the Rookwood Weir as part of the Lower Fitzroy River Infrastructure Project are associated with the new pipeline and the project. These projects will create extra water storage to further ensure a water supply in the lower Fitzroy region. It is projects like this that not only deliver jobs now but also ensure economic prosperity and job security in the Gladstone, Rockhampton and Central Queensland region well into the future. Water security drives industry certainty and underpins investment from around the country and from around the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007520"></A>
What I have said throughout the past 12 months is that in these difficult economic times Queenslanders can count on Labor to protect and create jobs. What we have seen today with the release of the unemployment figures for this month is that that has been delivered. We are going to keep delivering with projects like this one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007521"></A>
What does it take to deliver on a commitment like this? We made jobs our No. 1 priority. It takes focus, it takes determination, it takes delivery and it takes a team that has a unified sense of purpose about what we are working towards. We believe in the dignity of work and that is why jobs are our No. 1 priority. What we see on this side is a unified team fighting for the same purpose. What we see on the other side is unity LNP style. What we are going to see later this evening is a moment of complete unity when the member for Moggill will stand shoulder to shoulder, brothers in arms, with the member for Condamine; the member for Indooroopilly will stand shoulder to shoulder with the member for Burnett in a moment of great ‘liberal’ thinking. I cannot wait to be here to watch the complete subjugation of the Queensland Liberal Party to what can only be described as some of the more shocking exposés of the way that the National Party in Queensland has learned nothing. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer. RTI documents obtained by the opposition refer to two graphs prepared by Treasury but not provided to the opposition. Will the Treasurer table a copy of the two graphs which allegedly show a return to surplus in the Queensland budget both before and after the proposed asset sales? If not, why not? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007563"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. The documents he is referring to, of course, have all been provided to the shadow Treasurer under our right-to-information laws which, in fact, are the most generous, comprehensive and transparent around the nation. All documents that have been released that are required to be released have been released to the shadow Treasurer. Such decision is made by the RTI officer in the Queensland Treasury, not by me. That is the way the law works. However, if the shadow Treasurer does have a view that there is a further document then he knows that he is perfectly entitled to seek redress under the legislation that we have brought into this House to provide for these documents to be put into the public arena. Those opposite have done that before.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007564"></A>
The reality is that those opposite can keep asking for us to produce these documents and we will keep providing them in accordance with the law, but what they need to do is start to provide some documents of their own. If someone put an RTI on the shadow Treasurer’s office and asked for the opposition’s economic plan, they would get a blank piece of paper back. </Hansard-Body>

Where are the policies?’ As the member for Beaudesert said, until those opposite put up they should shut up. If they have an idea they should come in here and put it.

 Thank you, Mr Speaker. The reality is that this week we have seen an opposition that has demonstrated just how unfit it is for office. It does not have a policy or a plan for the future. Its idea of bringing on new talent is the member for Hervey Bay, who is dynamism personified. The future of the LNP is writ large and personified in the member for Hervey Bay, who is rolling up the charts with a rocket. Last week in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 the Leader of the Opposition is quoted as saying that he was going come back and have a little chat to the members for Gregory, Toowoomba South and ‘Lord Monckton of Warrego’. What did he do? He got a phone call from ‘Uncle Bruce’--Mr McIver--who put the finger on the tap and said, ‘No, no. Not so fast. Remember who is running the show here.’ It is not anyone here; it is the old puppet from outside. What we all want to know is: when is Bruce McIver going to let those opposite put out a policy, old son?</Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mundingburra for her question about the policies of this government--the things that we are actually doing, the things that we are proposing to create jobs, to make sure that we can build the economy to strengthen the state’s finances for the future. The questions that we receive from members on this side of the House are about the things that we propose, the things that we will do, the policies that we are pursuing, the agenda that we have--unlike the politics of smear that always exist on the other side, unlike the politics of vacuity, unlike the politics where they only pursue the lowest common denominator because they are unable to participate in a debate about policy. Those opposite are unable to participate in a debate where there is an alternative. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1007574"></A>
I am very pleased to talk about the fact that, as of 10.30 this morning, when the ABS released the labour force update, the job stats show that jobs growth is occurring in this state, that unemployment is falling to 5.8 per cent. I am pleased to advise the House that for the sixth consecutive month there is job creation in this state. In August 1,000 jobs were created; in September 2,800; in October 3,200; in November 3,300; and in December 3,700. As of today, with the increase this month of 2,900, 16,900 jobs have been created over the last six months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007575"></A>
This shows our policies, our infrastructure program and our Green Army in action. It shows our commitment to get the LNG industry up and running in this state and to writing contracts. It shows the policies that we proposed in the election in action, delivering jobs to the people of Queensland. We do this with an unemployment rate that is falling, despite maintaining the second highest participation rate in the country. As people continue to move here, as the school leavers go into the workforce, our job creation is getting ahead of the curve and delivering net jobs growth, and we see our commitment and our plan delivering on jobs and delivering for the Queensland economy in action. </Hansard-Body>

All the while, what do we hear from those opposite? As the member for Maroochydore said on ABC Radio, their jobs target is zero, their policy release so far is zero and their economic plan is zero. What we see is those opposite mired in the same old grist that they have always existed in inside the Liberal and National parties. One knows that the leadership is under challenge when the member for Maroochydore stands up and starts pledging loyalty. As the member for Callide would well attest, as soon as she is pledging loyalty then one knows that the forces are marshalling. One knows that once she comes out and says that the member for Southern Downs has her full support it is game on. The ginger group is growing. Just like the ginger grows in the wet, we see that the forces are marshalling. The member for Beaudesert says that there were only five of them that time because he told them that they needed to keep their powder dry. </Hansard-Body>

 Fundamentally, what we have seen is the conservatives walk away from a market based approach--like they walk away from everything they previously believed in, including PPPs and privatisation, whenever it suits them. What we have seen from the conservatives is a plan which will cost twice as much and ask ordinary families, ordinary taxpayers of Australia, to pay polluters to pollute. They do not want polluters to pay for pollution. They want ordinary, taxpaying Queensland and Australian families to pay polluters. That is their scheme. </Hansard-Body>

 ‘I thought that by getting there at 1.30 I would be early enough to get in.

 My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Will the Deputy Premier advise the House of the important role our health workforce plays in delivering health services to Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009617"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Not only of course does Health have an enormously large workforce itself--some 72,000 people--but a building program, worth $6 billion across Queensland, is creating jobs in regional Queensland hand over fist. Those people are then spending money in those local communities as well. Additionally, the healthier people are, the more they can then contribute to the economy of Queensland. We are delivering jobs for Queenslanders despite the global economic downturn. </Hansard-Body>

In complete contrast, the only job the opposition leader is concerned about is his own. I have watched his performances--and I watch performances of people here all the time--and his performance over the last week or so has been getting increasingly shrill, increasingly desperate. Unfortunately, when one is devoid of policies, one relies--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course the member for Callide lost his job, so I can understand his concern. The Leader of the Opposition is increasingly desperate and, what is worse, he is following the advice of people who do not have his best interests at heart. He is a shrill person who is in real trouble. When one looks at the conduct of people yesterday, it is scary--not on the particular issue but scary generally about their thought processes. God help them. They ought to read about Martin Niemoller if they want to read about tolerance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009628"></A>
We have an ageing population in Queensland. The Commonwealth Treasury’s intergenerational report says that the population of people aged over 65 will almost double over the next 40 years in Australia from 13 per cent in 2003-04 to 24.5 per cent in 2044-45. Already between 2005 and 2010 we have more than doubled the number of medical interns from 250 to 644. Since 2005, we have 12,600 extra nurses, doctors and allied health professionals. I have made it very clear in this House that we will continue to have to increase the number of people employed in our health system, first of all, as people get older and, secondly, as medical treatments improve and increase, they put additional expense and strain on our health system. That is why jobs in Health are jobs that are viable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009629"></A>
The opposition has made very clear its view. Its view is that it would rather protect jobs in the private sector in the commercial coal industry than create more jobs and be in a position for government to finance more jobs in the health sector. We have the second longest life expectancy on earth in this country. We have a very, very good health system. We can always make it better. We will not make it better if we are not able to employ more people because we have to put that money into assets and infrastructure that others should properly pay for. </Hansard-Body>

Police Service, Alleged Corruption</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1009633"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is directed to the honourable the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. I refer to the Police Commissioner, Mr Bob Atkinson’s, statement on 3 February about claims of police corruption on the Gold Coast. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009637"></A>
Allegations, insinuation, rumours have existed here on the Gold Coast for a long time. For at least, I would think 10 years. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009638"></A>
I ask: when the minister took up the portfolio, what advice did he receive on these established allegations from his predecessor and from the commissioner and why under Labor has it taken 10 years for effective steps to be taken? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009640"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. Since being police minister I have had numerous discussions with the Police Commissioner, and indeed the CMC, about serious issues and allegations about the Queensland Police Service. I want to start my response by saying that I have absolute confidence in the Police Commissioner and the senior leadership of the Queensland Police Service in dealing with these issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009645"></A>
On numerous occasions I have indicated and have been aware that there have been issues raised with the Gold Coast. I have been advised that there have been ongoing investigations, particularly by the CMC, in relation to these matters. I have met with the acting chair of the CMC--prior to Mr Needham, who was on leave, I understand--and I have met personally with Mr Needham. Both of those gentlemen have indicated to me that they do not believe--and I am not betraying any confidence here because they have made these public statements--that there is systemic corruption at high levels within the Queensland Police Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009651"></A>
I have been aware obviously of statements made about allegations on the Gold Coast. I think that has been public knowledge. I am satisfied with the efforts the Queensland Police Service has been taking to address these issues. I am satisfied with the very strong cooperation and support the Queensland Police Service has been given through its Ethical Standards Command, in which I have absolute confidence, in terms of the support they have been giving in terms of the joint operations they have with the CMC. </Hansard-Body>

That is happening right across the state. There is $8 billion worth of construction and 60,000 construction jobs rolling through our community. Members saw the good news today of an extra couple of thousand jobs being created this month. Just imagine what would have happened if those opposite had won the last election. They were going to stop the Capital Works Program, get rid of public servants, all of those things. You can only think in horror of what the--</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Community Services and Housing. Minister, I refer to allocations for social housing under the Nation Building--Economic Stimulus Plan. The New South Wales government has started more than 800 dwelling units and completed more than 200. Given the Queensland government has had its money for exactly the same time, will the minister update the House on how many units have been started and how many have been completed in Queensland?</Hansard-Body>

 It is good to be back. It is good to talk about housing. We have been busy creating jobs and building housing around the state. It is very evident from the members opposite what they have been doing during the recess. They have been putting their heels up because they have not come back with a housing policy at all. They are feigning interest in public housing but they have not come back with a housing policy. What have we done? Before Christmas I was in the Torres Strait with the Premier looking at housing initiatives. What have we done? We have built houses right around the state--Cairns, Coolangatta, suburbs in Brisbane and out west. We are building houses.</Hansard-Body>

To date, 148 projects have been signed with developers to deliver more than 1,420 dwellings. A further 67 agreements have been signed with not-for-profit providers. These are the houses the Minister for Disability Services talks about. These are supported houses for people with disabilities. They are going to deliver 966 dwellings under this. As we speak now, 557 dwellings are under construction. This is the biggest investment in social housing this state has ever seen.

 I love talking about housing. I love to see housing being built around the state. Do you know what people say when they move into that housing? As I have said before--I know I am sounding like a cracked record, but I love it--they say that they feel like they have won lotto. I have had about six people say that to me in the last few months, so honourable members should not just listen to me about this; they should ask them. What do they feel like when they turn the key in those houses? They feel like they have won lotto because they know they have a safe, secure, affordable roof over their heads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011887"></A>
This is the biggest investment in social housing this state has ever seen, but what do we have from that side of the house? What did the Leader of the Opposition say a couple of years ago about a development in Skiff Street in Surfers Paradise, in his own electorate? ‘Not these houses, not in this area.’ That is what you think about public housing. That is what you think. So do not come into this House and give us this absolute nonsense of feigning support for public housing and public housing tenants.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is addressed to the Minister for Education. I ask the honourable gentleman this question: how is the Bligh government working to meet demand for teacher numbers in Queensland?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011893"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am pleased to say that the Bligh government is building a strong economy here in Queensland, and I am pleased to say that the Bligh government is delivering on jobs here in Queensland. I want to welcome the 290 extra teachers who are in our state school system this year. We have created those new jobs to cater for the population increase that is happening across the state and in our student numbers. A total of about 780 new graduates have joined the 38,000 teachers in our state schooling system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011894"></A>
We know that many of these teachers, and particularly the new teachers, are starting their careers in challenging positions, some in rural and remote areas and others in low socioeconomic areas, and that can be a challenge. Some of these areas are difficult to staff. That is why we have undertaken initiatives to encourage new graduates to take up the opportunities to teach in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011895"></A>
Indeed, I can say that at this point 26 new graduates have taken up a bonded scholarship scheme that we have instituted which is focused on particularly difficult schools to staff. This will help with their tuition and expenses. They will spend two years working in remote or rural locations at hard to staff schools or agree to teach in subject shortage areas, like maths, science and manual arts. They will be provided with extra allowances in relation to accommodation, moving expenses and so forth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011896"></A>
This is what we are doing as part of an overarching, long-term strategic management of our workforce. We are committed to developing the workforce into the future. The difficulties we have in some of the hard to staff teaching areas are commonly shared around Australia, but we are working hard with the universities as well as taking these particular initiatives to staff those difficult to teach areas and those difficult to teach subject areas. This is quite contrary to what the member for Moggill has said in getting himself into a muddle. The member for Moggill is getting into a muddle about how you can actually force students to make particular choices at university. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. It is amazing the lengths the opposition will go to to talk down the Queensland economy and Queensland tourism generally. It is amazing the lengths they will go to. Before Christmas there was a report put out by Tourism Research Australia titled <Hansard-Italic>
International visitors survey</Hansard-Italic>
 and it revealed that two million international viewers spent more than 40 million nights and almost $4 billion in Queensland. It said that, whilst the numbers were down by six per cent, international travellers spent an extra 521,000 nights and an extra $64 million throughout the state than during the same period the previous year. That is a reduction of six per cent in the number of international travellers but an increase of $64 million spent throughout the state. Further, in relation to domestic tourists the organisation said that, whilst numbers were down four per cent, Queensland fared better than the national average, which dropped seven per cent. Queensland fared better than other states including New South Wales, which dropped nine per cent, and Victoria, which dropped seven per cent. Queensland saw an increased share in domestic visitor marketing, which grew by one per cent to 24 per cent. Both of those are good stories, but do you think we could get a good story out of the opposition or a good story out of the Acting Leader of the Opposition--or maybe over-acting opposition leader--Mr Springborg? What did he have to say? Mr Springborg said that places like New South Wales and Victoria have streeted Queensland in tourism advertising marketing. That is absolutely against the evidence. Mr Springborg believes it indicates that the tourism marketing campaign for Queensland has a long way to go and is still failing, saying that the Queensland government--</Hansard-Body>

Even when there is a good story there, even when it proves that we are doing better than the rest of Australia, he still has to talk it down and put a negative spin on it. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships. Can the minister please inform the House of the achievements of the Bligh government in overcoming Indigenous disadvantage? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011959"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Cook for that important question. I am very proud to be part of a Bligh government that is really facing Indigenous disadvantage and doing magnificent things that have already shown some good results to overcome this disadvantage. I remind the House of some of these achievements on the heels of the opposition leader’s absurd claims the other day that we are doing nothing. Take, for example, the $88 million groundbreaking Family Responsibilities Commission and the huge and beneficial effects that have already shown in reduced violence and improved school attendance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011963"></A>
Take the $1.16 billion, along with the federal government, in housing and infrastructure upgrades. Take the $66.4 million alcohol reform program--a courageous program on the part of our government. One might call it a tough love program, but it is one that is also reaping benefits. What about the whole-of-government Reconciliation Action Plan? No other state in Australia has it. We are the first state government to begin work on an overcoming urban Indigenous disadvantage strategy. That does not even give me the time to mention the huge reforms that the Minister for Education and Education Queensland are making to ensure better results from Indigenous children in the communities and in the cities and towns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011967"></A>
I think it is an absurd claim from the Leader of the Opposition that we are sitting on our hands and not acting, particularly coming, as it does, from a team that has no policies, no action plans and nothing at all in the way of direction for the Indigenous people of Queensland who want to share fully in our lifestyles. Policy free? Well, the only policy that I can find after checking his website is that of the remarks, still unclear, that were quoted in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. These were about Aborigines being treated as ‘living fossils’, ‘concealing a soft racism’ and ‘allowing Aborigines to fail’. The opposition leader figuratively twitched his moustache, rose in this House and twice suggested that we look at the speech for clarification. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011971"></A>
Again, I went to the website to look at the speech, as he twice suggested members of the House do, and there was no speech. I have been waiting for him to table it. I call on the opposition leader to table that speech, to let us all see what exactly he has said about Aboriginal people and to let us see what his policies are about the future of Indigenous people who so sorely need some assistance from this parliament. </Hansard-Body>

New England Highway, Connex Review</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011976"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. With regard to the Hampton-Geham section of the New England Highway, which is currently being reviewed, what is the estimated cost of the review being undertaken by Connex? Will that cost be taken from the project funds themselves, resulting in a lesser upgrade of the road or a shorter upgrade? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011978"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can assure the honourable member that those costs will not come from the overall project. They will be absorbed internally by my department. We do this planning right across the state. It is our job to do it and do it properly. As the member knows, I have consulted with both her and the member for Toowoomba North about this project. I have had various approaches from people supporting the initial decision of my department, which was to widen the road, and approaches from people who were not in favour of those particular actions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011979"></A>
That is why I took the step to have an independent body look at my department’s original decision. I think that was the right thing to do. As the honourable member advised the House, Connex has been appointed to have a look at that decision by my department, and a probity order has overseen its selection to ensure that its selection above other bidders was aboveboard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011980"></A>
The review will consider and assess safety records, the needs of motorists, ecological and environmental impacts, cultural and heritage significance, technical aspects of design and other design options. The review is currently underway and will take approximately eight weeks to complete. I am confident that the process will lead to the best outcome for the environment and the safety of road users. That is our No. 1 priority. However, I make no apologies for the fact that we engaged an independent third party to review the decision of Main Roads to make sure we got the decision right. There are some beautiful trees on that section of road. It would be a great pity if we had to destroy any of those trees, but safety must come first. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Mr Johnson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Big ones. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011983"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the member for Gregory’s interjection. They are wonderful big trees. If the only way to make road users safe is to remove those trees then we will unfortunately do that. It is a tough decision. These are decisions we make right across this great state when it comes to roads. Unfortunately, vehicles travelling at speed do not mix well with large structures such as trees. I will keep the honourable member informed. When we have that decision I will certainly inform both her and the member for Toowoomba North, who has been a wonderful advocate for those works. We will ensure that we get the correct decision for your community. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018226"></A>
Queensland’s State Valuation Service provides a vital service for Queensland, making statutory land valuations for every rateable property in Queensland every one to five years providing a reflection of Queensland’s property market and the unimproved land values used by the state and local governments in the assessment of rates, land tax and state land lease rental. This bill introduces a suite of reforms to refresh, revitalise and reposition the State Valuation Service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018227"></A>
The reforms being introduced will update and modernise the objection process. It will provide all landowners with a clear process to lodge an objection, and will encourage the inclusion of the appropriate information at the beginning of the objection process. This will ensure the objection is considered in a timely manner and the relevant information is available when the chief executive makes a decision on the objection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018228"></A>
The other reforms will provide certainty for local governments about when a valuation will be made through a regulated schedule helping them to forward plan their own budgets. A market adjustment factor is being introduced for the years where a general valuation is not being undertaken in a local government area. This will mitigate market fluctuations in the years between general valuations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018229"></A>
Another key aspect of the bill is amendments to confirm the definition of unimproved value. In December 2009, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland handed down a decision on the Pacific Fair case. If the court’s interpretation of the act in this case were to apply in future it would result in fundamentally different valuation principles being applied to commercial land, as opposed to other land types like residential land. It would also result in a sudden and material change in the total valuation base used by governments to determine rates and land taxation regimes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018231"></A>
The consequences of this Land Appeal Court decision would have had a significant impact on Queensland’s economy and the services that local governments provide to residents and would reduce the valuations by some 20 per cent for industrial land, 35 per cent for commercial land and 10 per cent for multiunit land. Without intervention, the commercial property owners would receive a massive discount in their rates at the expense of residential property owners. There would be a similar outcome in relation to land tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018232"></A>
Queensland already has the lowest land tax rates in Australia for high-value properties such as shopping centres. If the court decision were to stand, this would see a further reduction in tax paid by these properties of up to 35 per cent. Not only would it abruptly reshape the total valuation base on which rates and land tax are set, but it would also create financial exposure for councils based on past rates paid.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018233"></A>
If we did not act in introducing the current bill, the State Valuation Service would be required to undertake the last three annual valuations for all commercial and industrial properties reflecting the court’s interpretation, creating the immediate obligation on local government to provide commercial businesses with a refund on rates of over $600 million. This is a windfall reduction in rates to those businesses at the expense of ordinary ratepayers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018234"></A>
I cannot let that happen. We have to get the balance right between residential rate and taxpayers and commercial and industrial rate and taxpayers. This bill makes unequivocally clear that valuations for commercial and industrial properties in Queensland must continue to reflect the value of the land at its best and highest use, including the development premium embodied in leases. The bill confirms the valuations previously issued and provides certainty for the issue of valuations in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018235"></A>
The parliament could reasonably have expected this issue to have been resolved in 2008 when amendments were made to reinforce the definition of unimproved value. However, two provisions which were proposed were not included after concerns were raised by the Property Council of Australia. The Property Council of Australia was concerned that elements of a business conducted on the land might be included in the unimproved value of the land and that the provision about complete removal of risk would result in valuations which did not take into consideration evidence where there was a risk associated with continuing the current use. This would not be fair. To avoid the potential for these unintended consequences of concern to the Property Council, the amendments were removed during consideration in detail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018236"></A>
The government’s policy in introducing the 2008 amendments was to clarify that the historically successful development of land was not to be ignored in determining unimproved value. The Land Appeal Court decision demonstrates that this was not achieved. It was clearly not the intention of the parliament or government in the 2008 amendments that one part of the land owning community--that is, homeowners--should abruptly bear a significantly greater proportion of rate and land taxation revenue measures through the introduction of different valuation principles for commercial property.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018237"></A>
The government’s policy has always been to value land as developed. Once land has been successfully developed, its value increases because risks associated with its development have been overcome. That is a matter of history where leases or agreements are in place that are not a separate business but are a reflection of the use of the land. The entry into leases is part of that use and a reflection of the past successful development of the land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018238"></A>
The amendments make it clear that there is no greater risk in realising the use of the land or continuing the use of the land for any purpose for which it is being used at the date to which the valuation applies. The provisions include a definition of ‘invisible improvements’ and ‘holding costs’ and specify what is included in ‘unimproved value’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018239"></A>
The changes are designed to ensure that the level of value reflects the history of past successful development of the land, regardless of whether the assessment relies upon sales evidence or deducting the value of physical improvements, such as fill and drainage, from the improved value of the land. The amendments proposed in this bill do not change the government’s policy direction proposed in 2008 but do respond to the December 2009 Court of Appeal interpretation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018240"></A>
The court’s decision would lead to disproportionate and inequitable results. While general residential land is valued at its highest and best use, commercial and industrial properties would not be, as the impact of the decision would require that the past history of successful development of such land and its leasing at commercial rents be ignored. The amendments will not impact on general residential land valuations, which will continue to be valued for their residential use, but will confirm the approach of the State Valuation Service to valuation of commercial, industrial properties and multi-unit land. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (11.39 am): As most members have alluded to, this particular bill has created a great deal of interest in the community and has been the subject of many communications to, I should imagine, all members’ electorate offices, certainly including my own. The only other issue approaching that level of interest in my electorate has been the issue of a brothel which has been established there. I must say that many of the people who have written to me about this issue are like-minded people--the same people in fact in a lot of cases--to those who have written to me about the other issue. Can I say--and I suspect that this is the experience of other members--that most communications have urged members to vote against the government’s bill. A few have urged us to vote for it and there are many who are qualified as to which group the law should be applicable--in other words, they do not want it to apply as widely as is currently set out in the bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018278"></A>
One letter which deserves particular attention is the letter that I--and, I take it, most, if not all, other members of parliament--received from the Most Reverend John Bathersby, the Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. This is a letter of particular interest to me as a practising Catholic--not a particularly good one, but a practising one nevertheless. He says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018281"></A>
... the Catholic Church does not object to decriminalising altruistic surrogacy as regards the surrogate mother and the commissioning parents.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018282"></A>
He then goes on, however, to indicate that the church has--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018284"></A>
... a real concern that it is shaped largely for adults, without equal concern for surrogate children and their future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018285"></A>
The bill as proposed does provide protection, and in fact it is the raison d’etre really for the introduction of the legislation into this place at all--that is, to provide a legislative base for the interests of these children who, in a sense, are in a state of limbo at the moment. One point, however, to which His Grace has alluded in relation to the interests of children concerns me, and that is the lack of counselling that will be or should be provided for children. There is provision for legal advice and for counselling for people entering into surrogacy arrangements and so on, but there is no provision or mention of the desirability or otherwise of counselling for the children who will be born as a result of this procedure in their lifetime, particularly in their youth or in their adolescence. As we know from our own life’s experience and looking at the lives of our children and other children whom we are aware of in schools, children these days, particularly adolescents, have to meet many challenges and it is a difficult time. There is unfortunately a very high instance of youth suicide even in my own electorate. It occurs to me that the--and I will refer to this shortly--burdens that we will be placing on these children will make it desirable that they have access to counselling, and I would ask the Attorney to indicate in his summing-up the government’s attitude to the provision of counselling at no cost to the child by the government, bearing in mind the significance of this legislation. I think that would be an entirely desirable thing and it is a matter that I feel very strongly about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018289"></A>
Returning again to the letter from Archbishop Bathersby, he referred to a statement by His Holiness Pope Benedict last week which has been referred to, but I will quote it again--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018291"></A>
’The best chance children have of developing properly is found in a family because of the uniquely complementary roles played by husband and wife ... they need to dwell, grow and live with both parents, because the maternal and paternal figures complement one another in the education of children and the formation of their personality and identity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018292"></A>
It is important, then, that everything possible be done to ensure they grow up in a united and stable family.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018293"></A>
I do not think too many people would really have any great issue with that. That is the ideal, but reality is somewhat different. The reality is that we do have children who are the subject of this bill in our community already, and they will no doubt grow in number as time goes on. It is not a matter therefore of theology that we have to address; it is a matter of reality, in my view, that we have to address. I am very grateful for the letter from His Grace. His communication was obviously well considered and particularly temperate--might I say in stark contrast to some remarks from particularly members opposite.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018294"></A>
With respect to my position in relation to this, can I say that if I am asked as Kerry Shine whether I would engage in a surrogate arrangement my honest answer would be no. As a matter of faith, this would not be what I would choose to do. Similarly, were I posed with a child of mine who might be gay and asked for advice as to whether they should undertake a surrogate arrangement, I suspect, after much consideration and soul searching, that I would advise against it--not because I believe my own child would be a bad parent or unable to care for the child but because, sadly, the challenges of life are great enough without importing the stigmas and slights of others into a child’s upbringing. But these are my views as, can I say, a man of conscience and as a man of faith.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018295"></A>
My duty to this parliament, however, while rooted in my personal faith, must also be broader and more far sighted. I represent not an electorate of one but an electorate of many, and among that many there are views that run the entire spectrum of beliefs, of faiths, of ethical and political views. And so too must our laws be drafted broadly so that they empower our citizens and allow them the freedoms to express their beliefs. We in this parliament have a responsibility to be guardians of many beliefs and champions of a single body of law. This obviously cannot be an easy task. The government’s Surrogacy Bill, by and large, reflects the breadth of the institution of parliament and the protection that it should necessarily provide to citizens of this state. The bill does not impose any one set of beliefs upon the citizenry, but it does create a legal space in which those who wish to pursue their desire for a family can do so without fear of prosecution and without discriminating against any person or group of persons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018298"></A>
I support this bill because I do not believe that the law should be designed, as is the bill proposed by those opposite, to discriminate against particular individuals in this state, and nor do I believe that it should be designed to create a second class of children as a result. Faith in our lives must be allowed the room to grow and to breathe. It is not nurtured when the faith or hopes or desires of others are stifled under the guise that they threaten our own. The law should be a shelter for all beliefs and lifestyles in this way. While I may have no personal need nor desire to seek its protection, my responsibility as a member of this place is to ensure that that protection is not selectively denied to my neighbour. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (11.49 am): I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill. It is the government’s bill that I am supporting. I have listened intently to the many views that have been expressed by members from both sides of this House. While I have smarted at many of those expressed by members opposite, I am not speaking today to hector or to pick out those views that I find most personally offensive, nor in what I say do I wish to disrespect the views of the many constituents who have taken the trouble to contact me about what I know is an extremely difficult issue. I have received the full gamut of views from constituents, including views from people whom I know and hold in the highest regard. I acknowledge the strength of their beliefs. Many of them have their own personal stories to tell and all are passionate in telling them, and I have very much appreciated their guidance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018337"></A>
I have also appreciated the opportunity for this to be a conscience vote and I take the responsibility of that opportunity very seriously. Like all of us here, I have spent many hours considering this legislation and I have had to search my conscience to ensure that I am very clear on what my role is. I am clear on what my role is not, and it is not to be an arbiter on the moral and philosophical polarities of this argument and it is not to take into account the fact that some people have told me that they will not vote for me at the next election if I support this bill. I cannot let that influence any decisions that I make as a legislator. What I consider my role to be in this instance is to protect the rights of children in our community and to ensure that they are in the most loving and supportive environments possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018338"></A>
Recently I was visiting some year 7s at a local school to talk to them about what being a member of parliament means. They asked me what politicians do and I told them that, among other things, we make laws. They were really intrigued by this and we went on to talk about what sorts of laws they thought we might make. ‘Laws to make sure people don’t drink and drive,’ one said. ‘Laws to make sure people don’t murder,’ another said. ‘Laws to make sure people don’t steal,’ said yet another. Then a couple said all at once, ‘No, laws to make sure kids get looked after.’ That is the bottom line for me in this debate because right now, without this legislation, some children are being born and have been born and they simply do not have the same legal status as others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018339"></A>
Altruistic surrogacy is happening right now. It is happening for single parents, it is happening for heterosexual and same-sex couples and it will continue to happen regardless of whether this legislation is passed. I believe that we are not looking after the children born of those arrangements unless we pass this legislation. We are not making sure that they have a clear legal status and legal entitlements. We are not making sure that they will know who their parents are and their place in this world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018340"></A>
I do not believe that passing this legislation will encourage a wave of people rushing out to pursue altruistic surrogacy options, because this is hard stuff. These are not people who can just jump up one morning and think that they might go out and arrange an altruistic surrogacy as if they are going out to buy a puppy. They have usually exhausted all other possible means of conceiving. They may have been to hell and back with multiple failed pregnancies and years spent on an adoption list. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018341"></A>
We are not talking about commercial surrogacy. These are not people who will necessarily have a brave and generous close female friend or relative who is willing and psychologically able to bear a child and give it up to them. What a momentous thing it would be to even find such a person and what a momentous thing it would be to ask them--someone who would no doubt be precious and close to take it on. Under this legislation people are going to have to work even harder, because now there will be checks and balances to make sure that the right decisions are being made. </Hansard-Body>

There has been much research quoted in the past day or so about what sort of family environment is best for children. Research can be quoted in many different ways, often to support the views of those referring to it. However, I do not think there is any evidence that disputes the fact that children who are raised in a loving environment are more likely--not guaranteed but more likely--to turn into happy, fulfilled adults. The need to be loved is simply one of the most fundamental needs of any human being. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018343"></A>
Like many members in this House, I am a parent. My husband and I were both born into loving families. I have no doubt that we have many flaws as parents, but we love our children deeply. Like all of us, we have had to put aside time to consider important issues such as wills, health directives and who should look after our children should anything happen to us. The only consideration for us was: who would love our children the most? The fact that some of the friends we might ask were single or gay was simply not a consideration. I would simply want my children to be loved, and isn’t that critical? Do we not want children in our community to be wanted and loved? Unfortunately, I am sure the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport could tell us far too many stories about children who are not wanted, or protected, by their parents. Could a child ever really recover from that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018344"></A>
I cannot comment on who would make the best sort of parent. However, whatever else anyone might say about people who are seeking altruistic surrogacy arrangements, regardless of whether they are single or in a heterosexual or same-sex relationship, to go through what they must go through that person really, really, really wants that child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018345"></A>
I have not been captured by any lobby group and I cannot please everyone with the way I vote on this bill. I can go forward, however, knowing that I have examined my conscience and voted in the way that I think best protects the children in our community. I acknowledge what must have been an emotional and mammoth task for the members of the select committee who examined this issue in detail and I thank them for their deliberations. I particularly acknowledge and thank the Attorney-General for his hard work, fortitude and compassion in bringing this bill forward. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (11.56 am): I rise to participate in this debate today--and I intend to be brief, because I do not want to repeat any of what has already been said by my Labor colleagues. However, I want to address the definition of ‘family’. I have sat here and heard the LNP members over and over again define a family as a mother, father and the kids. I have heard them say how this is the only family structure, the only combination of family that will provide kids with the ability to shine and become the best adults possible with the brightest future. We have heard in this debate, and in other debates in this House, from members who have not been brought up in the traditional family structure and who have actually done quite well in life, including having long and loving marriages, raising kids and working in careers of their choice before being elected. So I do not think only the traditional family can provide the best outcomes for children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018348"></A>
I have heard the LNP members quote research on the traditional family. I would say that that research is probably correct, because the research they were referring to probably had very narrow, defined terms. But if you throw in very different variables--variables from out there in the real world--I would suggest that the research outcomes would be quite different. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018349"></A>
But it was the member for Gympie who really demonstrated the love of family. After reading his speech, I think it would be fair to say that, while he lived in the traditional family structure, it was not quite the ideal childhood. But no matter what happened he loved his family--he never wanted to be in another--which demonstrates something that I have said before in this House: a young child accepts their family no matter what the structure. At the end of the day, when they walk through the door they regard the people who live in that home as their family--their family who is taking care of them. I also want to say to the member for Gympie that it is a good person who can forgive, and I am pleased that he and his family were able to heal and get on with life as a family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018350"></A>
I ask members to think back to when they were children. They did not understand that there were different family structures. In fact, if we start thinking about how we would have described our neighbourhood or, if we lived in a rural area, the neighbours who lived in the streets close by, we probably would have said something like, ‘Well, that’s John and Mary’s house next door,’ or, ‘John and Mary live in that house,’ or, ‘Simon my friend from school lives with his mother in that house there,’ or, ‘Down the road is Mr and Mrs Smith and I think Billy is now there but I don’t know where Annie is,’ and, ‘There’s Sharon and Sue, who live in the blue house,’ and, ‘My friend Mary lives with her mum and dad, pop and nan.’ A kid would not have said, ‘The couple next door are a childless couple’, or ‘Billy has been kicked out by Annie so he has moved back home’, or ‘Sharon and Sue are a same-sex couple’, and, ‘How strange Mary’s nan and pop live with them.’ A kid accepts households and families no matter what the structure. That is why it is so hard for our child services officers when they remove a child from their parents. In that child’s eyes, no matter what those parents have done that is their mother, that is their father--no matter what. When a surrogacy arrangement has been made and a baby is handed over to their family they, too, will accept and love and be proud of their family no matter what that family structure is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018388"></A>
If we were talking about an adoption of a 10-year-old to a same-sex couple then I believe it would be fair to say, yes, there would be challenges, challenges for both the adults and the child, and there would be a time period of adjustment. But I also say that would happen with any adoption of an older child. It is the disapproving remarks and views of people in the LNP’s definition of traditional family that make families that are not of the traditional structure feel inadequate. It is those remarks that make children feel that they do not belong or have a chance to succeed. They are made to feel like second-class citizens. I am not surprised there are a number of kids who go off the rails; kids who do not come from the house with the white picket fence, a mum, a dad, a dog, a cat, two cars and a number of computers. The expectations placed on them from those with that strong narrow view of family is a huge pressure, a pressure that they should not have to endure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018389"></A>
There can be a lot of people in a family or perhaps there can be only two. A family contains people who love you, keep you safe, who are there for the good times and the bad, help you through the sad times and laugh with you during the happy times. That is what defines a family, not its structure. How many times have members heard people say ‘They treat me like family’, or ‘They look after me better than my own family.’ I do not believe for one minute that any one of us in this House can say that it was only their mum and dad who raised them. I bet if members really thought about it there were a number of people who assisted or shaped their upbringing: grandparents, aunts, uncles and neighbours. The member for Woodridge also mentioned how the church family can play a large role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018390"></A>
When I was listening to the old story of a traditional family of mum, dad and the kids, it reminded me of what people referred to as ‘the good old days’, the days when the doors and windows were quickly shut and people ignored the yelling and screaming from the neighbour’s house. Those were the days when people turned a blind eye to domestic violence. It just did not exist. It was better to put up with the abuse than be a family without a mother or a father. They were the days when child sexual abuse was never raised. Once again the expectations of families staying together were stronger than the support given to the victim or other family members during this time. I hope that we never return to those days. I hope families of all shapes and sizes continue to exist, be unconditionally accepted and flourish in our communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018391"></A>
There is another reason we need to start accepting a broader definition of family. Not too long ago I remember reading some statistics about the Australian population. I remember that one particular figure stood out to me: there were 50,000 more single women in the age group of 25 to 45 than single men in that age group in Australia. The article went on to say that those women will find it difficult to find a partner in Australia and, in fact, may never have a long-term relationship. Some will never have the opportunity to marry and have a baby. The <Hansard-Italic>

 newspaper on 24 January 2007 wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018392"></A>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018395"></A>
When this bill was introduced into the parliament I thought about those figures again and I thought about how we will have to start thinking differently and become more accepting of single-parent households. The member for Burnett said single women were just lazy and did not put in the effort to find a husband and have a child. These figures make a mockery out of the member for Burnett’s speech and, in fact, proves he is the one who is lazy. I also thought how wonderful this bill is that it will provide an opportunity for some of those women to be able to fulfil their desire to have a child and raise a loving family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018396"></A>
I want to thank all the people who contacted me either by written correspondence or phone and told me their views. In regard to those people who were against this bill, some of the correspondence was quite appalling, showed no compassion for those who do not meet their expectations of how they want them to live their life and showed no empathy towards their fellow human beings. There were also a number of letters or calls from people against the bill who were able to put forward their views in a respectful manner and showed they genuinely cared. There was also a number of people who were for the bill and I also thank them for raising their views with me. However, I believe the state member for Burleigh put it very eloquently when she said something along the lines of that it is not the job of this government or any politician to force a set of religious standards or dictate parenting styles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018397"></A>
I know this bill will bring joy to some wonderful people who would never have had the chance to have a child and raise a family. More importantly, I hope that this bill brings about a more unconditional accepting of family regarding its structure. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.06 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the debate on Labor’s Surrogacy Bill and the LNP’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill being debated in cognate. Labor’s Surrogacy Bill seeks to decriminalise altruistic surrogacy and provide a legal mechanism for the transfer of parentage of a child born as a result of an altruistic surrogacy arrangement from the birth mother to the intended parent or parents including heterosexual, married and de facto couples, singles and same-sex couples. The LNP’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill seeks to decriminalise and provide a legal mechanism for the transfer of parentage of a child born as a result of an altruistic surrogacy arrangement from the birth mother to intended eligible parents. This would be limited to heterosexual couples, both married and de facto, and would not extend to same-sex couples or singles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018400"></A>
As has been discussed previously during this debate, on 14 February 2008 the parliament resolved to appoint the Investigation into Altruistic Surrogacy Committee to investigate and report on whether altruistic surrogacy should be decriminalised and, if so, what the role of government should be in that process. The parliament asked the committee to give consideration to the criteria, if any, for persons to meet before entering into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement; the legal rights and responsibilities to be placed on parties involved in a surrogacy arrangement; whether there should be a genetic relationship between the child and parties to the arrangement; and the right of a child to have access to information about his or her genetic parentage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018401"></A>
Subsequently, on 8 October 2008, the committee tabled its report. The key recommendations in the report included that altruistic surrogacy be decriminalised in Queensland subject to a regulatory framework; the government’s role should include implementing legislative reform, including a mechanism to transfer legal parentage; altruistic surrogacy arrangements should be enforceable under state law; a genetic connection between the intended parent or parents and the child should not be a prescribed requirement; and births be reregistered after the transfer of legal parentage for a child and children have access to their original birth certificate when they turn 18 years of age. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018402"></A>
The committee’s report made no specific recommendation to legalise altruistic surrogacy to singles or same-sex couples, yet Labor’s bill proposes to do so. The LNP was not aware that it was the intention of the Bligh Labor government to include in this bill matters relating to single and same-sex parenting as they relate to altruistic surrogacy arrangements. Indeed, matters relating to single and same-sex parenting as they relate to altruistic surrogacy arrangements were not in the terms of reference provided to the committee by the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018403"></A>
That is why the bill introduced by the LNP has been put forward. The bill proposed by the LNP is consistent with the terms of reference provided to the committee by the parliament. The LNP bill achieves the objective of implementing a regime for altruistic surrogacy for heterosexual married and de facto couples. As the Bligh Labor government’s bill pools together the issue of altruistic surrogacy with the issue of single and same-sex parenting it has effectively chosen to complicate the question of altruistic surrogacy with the issue of single and same-sex parenting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018432"></A>
The LNP’s bill seeks to separate what many members of this parliament and many people in the wider community consider to be a complicated and difficult question regarding single and same-sex parenting. Indeed, it seeks to separate the issue from the complicated circumstances of the government’s bill as it relates to the original intent of the committee’s terms of reference and the committee’s recommendations regarding altruistic surrogacy. Therefore, I will be opposing Labor’s Surrogacy Bill and supporting the LNP’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill. We have heard from Labor members during this debate all sorts of criticisms of the LNP for pursuing this course of action. Those criticisms are unfounded. It is Labor that has complicated the parliament’s consideration of this issue and it is responsible for the LNP being required to introduce this alternative bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018435"></A>
I wish to point out that the LNP has excluded provisions from Labor’s bill in respect of both singles and same-sex couples. This is because the fundamental principle being defended by the LNP is that we believe strongly that a child has the right to grow up with both a mother and a father in their lives. As such, the LNP is saying in this bill that we believe that a parenting model that involves only a sole parent or two parents of the same sex is not ideal as far as the child is concerned and, as such, singles and same-sex couples ought not to be provided access to lawful altruistic surrogacy arrangements. Of course, that is not to say that the LNP does not recognise that in many cases heterosexual couples, both married and de facto, are far from model parents and do not provide the ideal environment for a child to grow up in. Sadly, in far too many instances heterosexual couples, both married and de facto, fail in their duty to their children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018436"></A>
Also, the LNP is not saying that single people or individuals in same-sex relationships are not good people. The LNP is not reflecting on the capacity of those people to love or care for others. There are many single parents in the community who devote themselves to their children and have their best interests at heart. There are many people in same-sex relationships who are undoubtedly very committed to their partners and their families. However, the LNP is supporting the principle that a child ought to have the right to grow up with both a mother and a father in their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018437"></A>
For that reason, we are consistently applying the principle that other models of parenting, both singles and same-sex couples, ought not to have lawful access to altruistic surrogacy arrangements, and that is a consistent approach. In doing so, the LNP is putting what we consider to be the best interests of the child first. Certainly, that is a value judgement. I acknowledge in this debate that others in this place and in the wider community will have their own values that differ from mine. I accept that and I respect that. I am aware that others in this place and in the wider community will have differing views not only about the availability of lawful altruistic surrogacy to singles and same-sex couples but about the very prospect that anyone or any couple, regardless of their preferences, should be able to enter into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018439"></A>
As I said earlier, the fundamental basis on which the LNP is approaching this question is a position which we believe to be in the best interests of the child. That concept of framing public policy based on the best interests of the child was canvassed in this place in August 2009 when members debated the Adoption Bill. Interestingly, that bill, introduced by the Bligh Labor government, did not extend the right to adopt children to singles or same-sex couples. The member for Bundaberg asked the Minister for Child Safety the following question without notice in this place on 26 November 2009 in relation to the reforms to adoption laws that had recently been passed by the parliament. The member for Bundaberg asked--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018441"></A>
Will the minister remind this House why these laws quite correctly continued to maintain the ban on same-sex couples from adopting children? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018443"></A>
The Minister for Child Safety replied in part as follows--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018445"></A>
While many long-awaited reforms will be made with this new act, some fundamental principles will not be changed. Two primary principles will continue to guide the adoption practice and philosophy in Queensland: firstly, the best interests of the child are paramount in all aspects of adoption practice; and, secondly, adoption is a service for children not a service for adults. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018446"></A>
We know from the minister’s answer that the two primary principles guiding the adoption practice and philosophy in Queensland under the Bligh Labor government are, firstly, the best interests of the child and, secondly, that adoption is a service for children, not adults. We must therefore assume that the view of the Bligh Labor government is that adoption of children by same-sex couples and singles does not align with those two primary principles. I am of the view that these two primary principles ought to be similarly applied to the regulation of access to lawful altruistic surrogacy arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018447"></A>
Altruistic surrogacy arrangements involve children as well as would-be parents and surrogates. Surely we must keep foremost in our minds the best interests of the child. Surely we must not consider altruistic surrogacy to be a service for adults, not children. Surely any reasonable interpretation of legislative consistency in Queensland would demand that in relation to singles and same-sex couples, in view of the fact that this parliament only months ago resolved that they ought not be permitted to adopt children, they should also not be given lawful access to legal altruistic surrogacy arrangements in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018448"></A>
Labor members must see the inconsistency they are proposing in their Surrogacy Bill compared to the provisions of the Adoption Bill they supported only months ago. Surely, at its core, in relation to both the regulation of the adoption of children and the regulation of access to lawful altruistic surrogacy arrangements in Queensland, we are making value judgements about the appropriateness and capacity of adults in different circumstances to be parents to children. As such, there should be no difference between the regulation of adoption and the regulation of lawful altruistic surrogacy if the Bligh Labor government truly believes, as the Minister for Child Safety indicated that it did, in the guiding principles of prioritising the best interests of the child. That would be a consistent approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018452"></A>
I want to acknowledge the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for canvassing a number of issues that confronted some of the arguments promoted by Labor members in this debate. I want to acknowledge the contribution of the member for Gladstone, who made, I feel, a genuine contribution promoting arguments that were both honestly and genuinely held. I want to acknowledge also the contribution of the Deputy Premier, who, amongst government members, made the most thoughtful and respectable observations about this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018454"></A>
The Deputy Premier attempted to mount a defence of the inconsistency between the provisions of Labor’s Adoption Bill, which prevented singles and same-sex couples from adopting, and the provisions of Labor’s Surrogacy Bill, which does propose to extend access to lawful altruistic surrogacy arrangements to singles and same-sex couples. The Deputy Premier insisted that the reason this inconsistency between the Adoption Bill and Surrogacy Bill is justified relates to the fact that some overseas countries from which the majority of adoptions occur oppose the adoption of children by same-sex couples or singles and that to participate in intercountry adoption programs Queensland must endure this inconsistency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018457"></A>
Unfortunately for the Deputy Premier, this argument is inconsistent with the answer provided by the Minister for Child Safety to the question asked by the member for Bundaberg in this place on 26 November last year, when the minister said in no uncertain terms that the two primary principles guiding the adoption practice and philosophy in Queensland are, firstly, the best interests of the child and, secondly, that adoption is a service for children, not adults. There was no mention of the views on adoption of overseas countries. That is of course until the exact same question was asked by the member for Bundaberg of the Minister for Child Safety yesterday to which he gave a different answer from last year, before Labor’s Surrogacy Bill was on the agenda, and different from the answer he gave to the same question today when he gave no answer at all. Unfortunately for the Deputy Premier, this inconsistency on the part of the Minister for Child Safety is fatal for his argument. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018461"></A>
The LNP in contrast has been consistent. The LNP supported the Adoption Bill and those primary principles. It is Labor that is being inconsistent. The LNP is pleased to stand firm on these principles, and we believe that they reflect the views and the values of the majority of Queenslanders. I am pleased to support the LNP’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill and oppose Labor’s Surrogacy Bill. The fundamental question being asked here is who is best equipped to care for and raise children. I believe it is two parents: a mother and a father. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundaberg--LNP) (12.19 pm): I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill. Altruistic surrogacy is an issue that deserves thorough and open debate because of the serious impact the government bill will have on all Queenslanders. It is therefore inappropriate to play politics and sneak the issue of same-sex relationships on to the same piece of legislation. This government’s legislation is doing exactly that, by adding same-sex, single and commercial surrogacy onto a bill intended for married and heterosexual de facto couples. By adding on these other categories to a bill that is about the hopes and dreams of married and de facto couples who are desperate to have their own children, the government is cheapening both debates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018500"></A>
The LNP bill aims simply to provide optimism for those Queensland married couples and heterosexual de facto relationships that have struggled to hold on to their hopes of having their own family. It is their hopes of having a child that are central to the LNP’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009. The LNP’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill will make sure those young Queenslanders who are born through an eligible surrogacy are protected and cared for in a nurturing home with a safe and stable family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018501"></A>
When the seriousness of these matters is considered, the current bill simply does not need other matters added to it. The issue of altruistic surrogacy is serious enough because it is dealing with the hopes of Queensland families and the protection of Queensland’s children. It deserves its own debate for the sake of these families and couples. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018502"></A>
In 2008, all sides of parliament formed a committee on this issue to investigate the deep moral and ethical issues involved with altruistic surrogacy. This committee made recommendations that formed the basis of this bill. To play politics with it is toying with the hopes of Queensland families and the safety of Queensland’s surrogacy children. This is what the Bligh government is doing by expanding the availability of altruistic surrogacy from married and heterosexual de facto couples and making it available to everyone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018503"></A>
The original intent was to address the hopes and dreams of families and to address the rights and wellbeing of children. But, instead of this, the Bligh government is attempting to dramatically shift current legislation by including same-sex couples and singles. It is also trying to insert the debate on parentage rights under fertilisation procedures into this bill when that matter deserves its own debate within our parliament so members can make a separate judgement on this issue. By latching these issues onto the bill, the Bligh government is preventing a true democratic debate on matters that should be treated with more respect.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018505"></A>
The bill does not just toy with the hopes of Queensland’s heterosexual couples who are desperate for children. The Bligh government’s bill is actually playing silly politics with the hopes and dreams of same-sex couples who are trying to have more than only altruistic surrogacy addressed by our parliament. For example, the Bligh government denied same-sex couples adoption rights, which seems hypocritical in light of what it is trying to do with altruistic surrogacy. Therefore, parentage recognition for same-sex female parents of a child conceived through assisted reproductive technology should be debated separately on its own merits. It should not be added onto an already technical and ethically challenging piece of legislation. Regardless of each member’s position on those matters, it is not something to be sneakily tagged onto the current bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018506"></A>
The parentage rights under fertilisation procedures is also worthy of its own debate due to the serious moral and ethical questions it raises. It is an entirely separate issue to altruistic surrogacy and the Bligh government is not giving parliament a true chance to debate both these matters on their own merits because it is simply bundling it all into the one bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018507"></A>
The LNP bill does not try to address separate debates in one bill. It simply goes about addressing the recommendations made by the committee. The LNP believes the changes to altruistic surrogacy laws are important. This is contentious legislation which should be debated on its own merit, not hijacked to address the government’s political agenda. Parliament needs to consider the Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009 on its own merits. The LNP proposal containing it to married and heterosexual couples achieves this. This is why the LNP bill is the better option and why we oppose the Bligh government’s bill.</Hansard-Body>

I ask all members to put political persuasions aside and look into their moral fibre and have the intestinal fortitude to make a true conscience vote on this very important bill before the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (12.26 pm): Today, I rise to speak briefly in the cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill. These two bills address issues of surrogacy in a similar way, but at the same time they could not be more different. The titles of the respective bills have only one word separating them, and that word is ‘family’. That is the key to this whole debate: what or who constitutes the ideal or the idyllic or the best possible family? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018517"></A>
We have heard speakers for and against both bills, and these two bits of legislation will be carried on a vote--a vote not consistent with a vote of the Australian people who, when polled in a Galaxy poll last year, overwhelmingly said that the most ideal family should include a biological mother and a biological father. That was 86 per cent, and that is not surprising. It is a compelling argument and it was raised by the deputy leader of the LNP and it has been used by many other speakers since.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018518"></A>
Yet those opposite would have us believe that to vote against or to even speak against the government’s bill must be homophobic: this can be the only possible reason anyone would have for not supporting the government’s bill. Well, they would be wrong. My vote will be for the children--the children who, through no fault of their own, will end up as pawns in a high-stakes social engineering experiment. They will become guinea pigs in this experiment. The ramifications of the government bill, if carried, will only begin to be felt in the years to come--not by me, not by many honourable members here, but by the children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018519"></A>
The government will almost certainly create a range of problems for children not yet conceived. The children are the ones who will pay the price--a price I cannot begin to imagine--with the social issues, the mismatched family groups, the psychological issues and who knows what else. While I do not know if any child will suffer harm or how horrific that harm may be if the government’s bill goes through, those members opposite cannot make any guarantees to me that those children will not suffer harm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018520"></A>
I accept that in some circumstances same-sex couples and singles could make much better parents than the so-called traditional family units, but we live in an imperfect world. The risk is too great, and the government’s bill is a gamble I cannot and will not take. It opens up legal and social minefields--minefields that can destroy the one person most in need of protection under this legislation, and that is the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018521"></A>
The government legislation is crafted in a selfish manner. It biases the wants or the whims of a minority in our community. Parenting is a privilege and a blessing. It is not a right; it is a gift. A child is not an accessory or a commodity that could be or should be traded. It sounds so cold when I hear an argument put forward that basically starts and ends with ‘I want a baby regardless of my circumstances. Whether I am in a same-sex relationship, whether I am a single male, whether I am a single female, or what age I happen to be, I want a child.’ That is framed and couched in a very selfish manner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018550"></A>
Again, I concede that I know of single parents, both male and female who are doing a tremendous job against the odds raising a family with no-one there to support them in many cases. I am also aware of same-sex families who are doing a tremendous job raising children, but it is not the ideal. It is not the best possible circumstance for any child to be raised in. We should not be exposing them to that. This is a no holds barred, anyone who wants one can have one approach, and it is wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018553"></A>
During this debate we have heard much about discrimination. I am going to discriminate. I am going to discriminate in favour of the child. We have heard about rights. I am going to stand up for the rights of the child. As members, we have all received calls, emails and letters on a range of issues and we receive them daily, but this has sparked a chord in the community and we have received many more emails and calls on this issue, as I have heard members on both sides agree. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018554"></A>
I have had an inflow of emails since the government brought on this cognate debate from residents who normally do not write to me or take the trouble to contact me, or are quite happy with their lot in life. I will be sharing some of their comments. These are comments from constituents, not form letters. Some of them are very short and simple. Some are more convoluted, and I will edit those and read the salient points. One letter states, ‘We strongly disagree with this Surrogacy Bill.’ That is it. That is the entire letter. Another one states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018556"></A>
Peter, to pass a bill of this nature would be denying children the right to parents, male and female, not 2 males and not 2 females. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018557"></A>
A third one states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018559"></A>
Dear Peter, I am flabbergasted to even think that a proposal of this nature would be considered. It seems the consideration is only for the people proposing this ludicrous bill and not for the children who are born with the right to have a mother and a father. It’s bizarre to imagine the consequences of the damage it would do to these precious innocent children if this bill was ever passed. PLEASE do not allow this to happen, for the sake of the children. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018560"></A>
There is nothing whatsoever homophobic in it, but it seems that is the only defence from those opposite. A fourth letter states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018562"></A>
This Bill is not just about surrogacy as a ‘last resort’ for an infertile couple. It signals a social revolution that would destroy the meaning of ‘parent’ and deprive children of their most basic right to have a real mother and father. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018563"></A>
This allows any adult--including a single man or woman, or same-gender couples--to obtain a child ‘of their own’ using a surrogate woman’s womb ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018564"></A>
Surrogacy itself is inherently wrong, since it involves the premeditated intention to separate a child from his or her birth mother ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018565"></A>
The Government’s determination to allow surrogacy for homosexual couples and single persons will breach the fundamental right of every child to at least begin life with a mother AND a father.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018567"></A>
I, like every other member, I suspect, received a letter from the Most Reverend John Bathersby, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. He has been quoted continuously through this debate. I am pleased and proud of the support we received from the church. I advise the House that I do bring a bias to this debate, as we all do. I am a Catholic and this is the spiritual leader of my church here in Queensland. I am pleased that his correspondence has hopefully sparked the conscience of those who are talking much about a conscience vote. I will not repeat the correspondence, because it has been quoted already. I will close with one final letter from a young mum in my area, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018569"></A>
We believe this bill places the desires of the ‘parent’ or ‘parents’ above the needs of the baby. Each baby has the right to grow up with the love, nurture and example of a mother and a father. And children do best when raised in such an environment. We know sometimes in life, through family breakdown, this doesn’t happen, and single parents often go on to raise well adjusted children. However, to deliberately plan to deprive a child from the onset of a mother, or a father, so the desires of adults can be met is wrong Mr Dowling. The rights of the child should be more important than the desires of adults ... two homosexual men, without a mother simply because these two men feel they would like to be parents. That baby has the right to be breastfed and nurtured, held, rocked and sung to by her mother. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018570"></A>
Or his mother--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018571"></A>
Even the most well intentioned adult cannot replace this. To deliberately deny any baby of this is morally wrong. I can’t help wondering what might happen then to this baby should this couple separate, and form new partnerships. Imagine the confusion then this little one would be subjected to. I also have questions about the rights and the desires of siblings of such a little one. In the case of other children belonging to the surrogate mother, has anybody asked how they might feel to see their mother’s new baby given away, and how that might affect their own sense of security ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018572"></A>
I am so glad to read that the Opposition has asked that the question of single parent and same sex surrogacy be separated from the issue of surrogacy for infertile couples--this is an absolute necessity, and I am grateful to whoever has put forward this amendment to the bill. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018573"></A>
This Surrogacy Bill as it stands must be defeated. It is a cruel piece of legislation couched in terms of parental desires and rights. For the baby, it allows no protection--of his or her rights to a natural upbringing ... I strongly urge you to vote to defeat this bill ... I wonder if Premier Bligh is prepared to be accountable to those children in the years to come. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018574"></A>
I will be voting for the Family (Surrogacy) Bill and not the Surrogacy Bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (12.36 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill. In speaking to this bill, I note that many members have touched on many of the issues contained in the range of items of correspondence that I have received in my electorate office and also here in Brisbane. I note that the Speaker recently made a ruling in relation to the tabling of documents in parliament. I suggest to the House that, in relation to the many documents that I have received, instead of tabling them as I intended to, because of the similarity of much of the material that is contained in my letters and emails, I propose to retain them here with me for members who may wish to view them. Suffice to say that I will not be tabling them. I have no doubt that the contents of the submissions I have received are very similar to those that government, opposition and Independent members have already received. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018577"></A>
I must say that, out of all the submissions I have listened to since the debate commenced at about this time yesterday, the member for Hinchinbrook stands out. It was a very balanced, very reasoned and very sensible contribution to the matters contained in both bills which are being debated at the moment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018578"></A>
I understand the government has allowed its members a conscience vote. That is very commendable. However, what does disappoint me is that the government has not been prepared to divide the bill. I believe there are many good aspects in both the government’s bill and the opposition’s bill. However, because of the government’s decision to say, ‘You vote for it all or you vote against it,’ it really puts us all in a very difficult predicament. I believe there is overwhelming support across the chamber for aspects of both the government’s and the opposition’s bill, but unfortunately that will not happen because it will not be possible to vote for parts of the bill. Instead, you have to vote for it all or vote against it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018579"></A>
Quite a few members have spoken about the submissions they have received and many have spoken about the letter from Archbishop Bathersby. While I do not intend to quote his letter or specifically reflect on his letter, a few years ago I approached Archbishop Bathersby about another matter, and that was a private member’s bill which I introduced into this House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021912"></A>
It did not deal with the rights of the child but it dealt with the rights of terminally ill people. It is all part of life and part of our community. It dealt with the rights of people with a terminal illness in Queensland. At that time there were many opponents saying, ‘You can’t, you shouldn’t,’ for a whole range of reasons. Archbishop Bathersby made the time to sit down and talk with me about my proposal. After considering it he was prepared to pen a letter for me to bring back to this parliament wherein he indicated his support for what I was trying to do. Many people in Queensland wanted the government to amend the state law so that people suffering from a terminal illness were able to pass away with dignity and without pain. The government did listen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021915"></A>
The reason I make that contribution to this bill is that I find Archbishop Bathersby a very reasoned man. He is prepared to put pen to paper. I would just like to thank him for being prepared to stand up and share with others his views on some of these controversial issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021916"></A>
I will give my personal view. This is my personal and this will be the way I will vote on this contentious matter. I am aware it is very contentious. We all know it is very contentious. I believe--notwithstanding the difficulties we all know are present in our community with people who do the wrong thing, drink too much alcohol, do not respect their partner, their husband, their children--children should have an opportunity to have a mother and a father. I believe that is the cornerstone of what our whole community is about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021917"></A>
That is my preferred position. I believe that is the ideal position that most people would aspire to. But, unfortunately, there are people for whom that is not possible for a whole range of reasons. I am not going to repeat them now. As a government, as an opposition, as representatives of a parliament, we need to aspire to what is the ideal situation. I personally believe that all children should have an opportunity to have a mother and a father. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021918"></A>
I will accordingly be voting that way when this matter comes to a vote. I will not be supporting the government’s bill because there will be no opportunity to specifically vote for the parts that I do support and against the parts that I do not support. No doubt I will when we consider the clauses. In relation to the bill as a whole, that will not be possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021919"></A>
I am very pleased the opposition has been able to bring forward its bill for consideration so we can see the difference between the government’s position and an alternative government’s position. I resume my seat and look forward to this bill proceeding to the consideration in detail stage so we can have some divisions and vote. Hopefully, we might see changes to the proposed legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (12.42 pm): I rise to support the Surrogacy Bill 2009. I will be voting against the Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009 for reasons that I will explain later in my contribution. I was given the privilege of being a member of the 2008 Investigation into Altruistic Surrogacy Committee. At the outset I must recognise the immense contribution of the former member for Kurwongbah, Linda Lavarch. Her contribution to that committee, like her parliamentary contribution and her contribution in life, was both wise and compassionate. I think she brought a great deal of leadership to that committee given we had to deal with some of the very difficult issues that surround surrogacy, reproduction and artificial reproductive technology. I place on record my sincere thanks and admiration for Linda. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021922"></A>
The select committee was an opportunity to consider these difficult issues in a bipartisan way. For the most part, that committee was very constructive and dealt quite diligently and sincerely with some difficult issues. It was also an opportunity to hear from community members. The committee heard from the Kirkman family. Alice Kirkman was the first child born of surrogacy in this country. To see firsthand someone who was so mature, so clear about how she was brought into this world and so comfortable with the relationship between her birth mother and her mother was something that gave me great confidence in supporting the changes that we are discussing here today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021925"></A>
It also gave an opportunity to hear from church groups and those with a view around the moral aspects of this bill. Those views were not necessarily one. There were a wide range of views. Most groups supported the decriminalisation of surrogacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021926"></A>
I must say that I was disappointed in the member for Currumbin’s criticism of the former member for Kurwongbah and her questioning of persons during that inquiry. From what I understand, the member for Currumbin’s concern is that the only people who were asked about what should happen in the event of a person being charged were those people who supported the ongoing criminalisation of surrogacy. That is an entirely sensible suggestion. Why would we ask someone who is coming to the committee to argue for decriminalisation their view on what should happen in the event of a parent going to jail? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021928"></A>
I want to refer to the question from the transcript. The question was to Reverend Percy from the Presbyterian Church. The former member for Kurwongbah’s question was--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021929"></A>
In the situation where a child is born of a surrogate arrangement and that comes to the attention of the law, in your view should the commissioning parents and the surrogate mother perhaps face a term of imprisonment? What would happen to the child? Should the birth mother and the parents face the criminal consequences of the laws at the present time? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021930"></A>
That, I put to you, colleagues, is the fundamental question that we have to face in dealing with surrogacy. Should this legislature introduce laws that make it a crime for people to use assisted reproductive technology to have a child? If they do have a child in this arrangement, is it in the best interests of that child that their parents go to jail? That is the crux of this issue. I think that the member for Currumbin’s criticism of the former member for Kurwongbah is entirely unjustified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021932"></A>
We also heard from the Kupai Omasker Working Group of the Torres Strait islands and the dealings they had with surrogacy in their community. Really, that was a matter beyond the terms of reference of the committee. I understand that it is a matter that has been under discussion for some 20 years now. It is a matter that this legislature will one day have to turn its mind to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021933"></A>
Most importantly, we heard from intending parents who desperately wanted to add a child to their family, however that family might be made up. We heard from people who are unable to have children because of cancer, because they were born without a uterus or because they were simply unable to bring a pregnancy to term. I cannot imagine how any compassionate person could sit across a table from these people and tell them that they should be denied access to the assisted productive technology that others can avail themselves of and why any child that they might have should be treated differently under the law to other children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021934"></A>
In the time since that committee I have had the chance to talk to constituents with those same concerns. Coincidentally, the mother-in-law of Kirsty, whom the Premier mentioned in her speech, Carol, is one of my constituents. She has been to see me. We have talked quite passionately about how she would love to have grandchildren and how this law that we are here to repeal has been stopping her son and daughter-in-law from proceeding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024256"></A>
Put simply, in my view the current ban on surrogacy is draconian legislation and its repeal is long overdue. While there is room to regulate the arrangements for the best interests of children, there should not be any law that prescribes imprisonment for people wanting to have children. The reality is that no-one chooses surrogacy as a preference. I cannot imagine a situation where anyone who could have a child either through natural means or through other forms of assisted reproductive technology would choose surrogacy over those technologies. It is a difficult and traumatic process at the best of times and should always be an option of last resort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1191686"></A>
The committee heard a range of numbers about how many families would actually avail themselves of this technology. The evidence was that it might be up to 50, but in other states where it exists it has been between six and 12. So I do not think in any case we are talking about the floodgates being opened. These types of controversies are not new. We have had these debates over the last 50 years--whether it is the introduction of oral contraception, whether it is the introduction of in-vitro fertilisation. But society has grown with those technologies and we have learnt to deal with them and they have become widely accepted within our community. In my view, surrogacy will be no different.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024260"></A>
To oppose surrogacy in my view is also a denial of the reality of surrogacy that already exists in our community. It happens in our suburbs behind the closed doors of houses in your street and mine and to not provide a legal framework that deals with this is simply to bury our heads in the sand. It is also a denial of the changes in reproductive technology that people can avail themselves of. Surrogacy has really only become available since assisted reproductive technology has allowed fertilisation without sexual intercourse. More importantly, though, and as I move on to the debate about the differences between the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill, it is also a denial about the current status of family groups in this country and in our communities and in the community that I represent. This is not some left-wing conspiracy. This is about the reality of who cares for children in our community now. There are single-parent families which, I must say by definition, are same-sex families. There are same-sex families already providing care and development and nurturing home environments for children. There are blended families where, with relationship breakdown and relationships coming together, people might bring families together. Sometimes it is even the case that through that process of blended families people end up caring and nurturing for children who have no biological connection to them, but that does not mean that they cannot provide that caring and nurturing environment. So to simply suggest that the only type of family that we should allow is a heterosexual mother and father is, I think, to deny the reality of what happens in our suburbs, in our streets and in the homes next door.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024264"></A>
This bill also provides legal recognition that recognises the reality of surrogacy and the reality of who raises children, who reads them their books, who takes them to school. At the moment if we legislated for surrogacy and did not fix those issues of legal parentage, we leave these children in a state of limbo like, unfortunately, New South Wales has. Legal recognition of parentage is important to not only recognise the reality of family life but to allow the people who raise children to be recognised on birth certificates, to be able to sign a school enrolment form, to be able to authorise medical procedures, to be able to sign for a passport. I know people have argued that there is access under the Family Court for people to seek parenting orders, but those parenting orders do not go to those essential issues of birth certificates, school enrolment, medical procedures, passports and succession, and there is no reason these children should have fewer rights than anybody else.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024265"></A>
One of the key issues in this bill is that there is no forced relinquishment of children. This was an issue raised by many of the submitters at the inquiry, and those who supported forced relinquishment were by far in the minority. The evidence brought to the committee from other jurisdictions where surrogacy has had a longer history is that relinquishment concerns are very rare in altruistic surrogacy. It has a higher incidence in cases of commercial surrogacy, but when we are talking about altruistic surrogacy issues of relinquishment are quite rare, and that should always be the case. We should not be legislating to resolve disputes about relinquishment once the procedure has been entered into and a child has been born. The time for intending parents and surrogate parents to deal with those questions of relinquishment is before the arrangement is entered into. If a birth mother decides that she cannot part with that child, that is a risk that intending parents take and they enter the process with their eyes open--provided with appropriate legal advice and provided with appropriate counselling, and the surrogate mother is provided with appropriate counselling as well to make sure that she knows what she is getting herself in for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024266"></A>
I wanted to address the differences between the Surrogacy Bill and the bill proposed by the opposition--namely, the recognition of same-sex parenting and the non-discriminatory decriminalisation of surrogacy allowing single people, same-sex couples and de facto couples to use assisted reproductive technology for surrogacy. A central tenet of this legislation is to provide equal legal recognition to children and their parents, regardless of the nature of their birth. It is not for children to be disadvantaged by the fact of how they were brought into this world. We as a parliament should ensure that, regardless of how one is born, they receive the same legal recognition before the law. Regardless of one’s moral view of the parents who decide to have a child, these children deserve to have legally recognised parents who can support their growth and development, who can enrol them in school and who can authorise medical procedures, however that relationship may be made up.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024269"></A>
The other issue which I ask members to turn their minds to is whether politicians should be deciding who should be able to reproduce and whether that is with or without the use of assisted reproduction technology, and I must say that I am quite upset by some members who have slung the term ‘social engineering’ at the proposal put forward in the Surrogacy Bill 2009. The Surrogacy Bill 2009 recognises that it is not for government to decide who can have children and who can reproduce and who can take advantage of existing assisted reproductive technologies. It is actually the Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009 which says, ‘These people are allowed to reproduce and have children and these people aren’t.’ That, in my submission, is a very slippery slope and in my view is social engineering.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

There will be arguments put to this House about a child being denied a family. Let me say that the research presented to the 2008 committee and by mainstream professional groups shows that developmental outcomes for the child do not depend on the nature of their birth but the nature of their care. To be honest, there are many heterosexual couples who are known to be dysfunctional in their parenting skills and are well known to the Department of Child Safety. One of the most eye-opening experiences of my time as an MP was dealing with a mother who has had three children taken out of her care. The last one was taken by Department of Child Safety officers at the maternity ward and she was given contact arrangements so that she could breastfeed the child. While the Department of Child Safety was well aware of concerns about the developmental issues of that child, it is not for the government to decide who will make a good parent and who will not. It is for parents to decide whether they have children. Just as there are many loving and nurturing heterosexual families, there are many loving and nurturing same-sex couples and many nurturing single-parent families as well. It is not the nature of the family that defines whether they can raise a child; it is the care and support that those families can provide.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1024277"></A>
In my view it is not for government to make laws about other people’s reproductive rights. While we may have moral views about who should start a family and when, that is not something we should be making laws about. That is something for individuals to make their own decision about. If I come back to the crux of my argument, the question before the House is, regardless of your family make-up, should it be that people should go to jail for wanting to have a child?<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (2.30 pm): I support the bill introduced by the Attorney-General and oppose the tawdry contrived bile that the shadow Attorney-General has invited with his opposing bill. The shadow Attorney-General’s bill has polluted this debate with the sort of reactionary bigotry that evolution has overcome against, thankfully, forces greater than the LNP. This is a debate about rights--about the rights of children. The premise here starts from the reality that, through the history of time, folk have pursued passion and expressed love in many different ways and folk who have done so have also borne children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029077"></A>
One member remarked that we cannot command the tide nor stop the wind. These are forces that are equally incapable of regulation by this or any other parliament. Not only are they incapable, they are inappropriate for the task of this House, or indeed any other assembly. Children have long been born out of wedlock. Would any member today seriously abide the concept that such children are denied rights under succession law? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029078"></A>
I commend in particular the thoughtful and substantial contribution from the member for Chatsworth. What a fine example of the power and privilege of a representative parliamentary democracy. The shocking revelation that must be delivered to the moralisers opposite is this: you can no more command the tide than stop the birth of children in the circumstances contemplated by this bill. Surrogacy has long been illegal, and shamefully. But does any member actually believe that there are not in this state today children born of surrogacy arrangements? Those arrangements, it is safe to predict, would have included all manner of combinations that so enrage and appal the opposition. The tragically sad reality is, because of the stain of the law that we will repeal today, these children have been denied rights afforded at law to other children. Those laws do not change biological parentage, they do not change who loves those children; they just stand in the way of those children benefiting from the rights and privileges that children born in other circumstances enjoy. There is nothing second class about any child I have ever met. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029079"></A>
The upshot of this shameful attempt by those marshalled around their moralising will be to disadvantage, tag and mark children by virtue of the relationship between their biological parents. Could there be a more callous endeavour ever pursued in this parliament? Like it or not, here is the news flash: this happens, it has happened, it will happen and it only happens that it is the children here that the opposition will victimise because of their hardened hearts.</Hansard-Body>

One cannot help but remark upon this debate for what it has delivered, but also for who has gone missing. Where are the members for Indooroopilly, Clayfield and Moggill? Is there a true Liberal left in this House? Apparently there is only a chosen army whose central charge has inexplicably centred on socialism. The only social engineering being proposed in this debate is that contained in the opposing bill. We all know the reality of opposition MPs’ enslavement to the LNP’s utterly regrettable position. There is no conscience vote for the LNP on this matter. This apparently is not a problem in the absence of any of them demonstrating that they have a conscience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029081"></A>
Is there a member on the other side of the House with at least the decency to walk in here and enjoin the debate to deplore and decry that which has been said by the knuckle draggers like the member for Condamine and the member for Burnett? We recognise that they have all been told to toe the line. So much for free thinking. Just ask the member for Beaudesert. He belled the cat on the need for policy development and was told that it was okay to speak out and then very quickly was dismissed from a policy committee. His great sin--a request for policy, a request for substance. His punishment--being sacked from a policy committee. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029082"></A>
But what is even more cowardly in this debate than their failure to vote against, to stand up for the individual rights of children who have no say in the manner of their entry into this world, is their failure to walk in here and at least separate themselves from the comments that are today bringing us national condemnation. By their silence they embrace the vile idiocy that will forever stain the <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 of this parliament. By their silence they condone the bigotry being peddled. Most shamefully, by their inaction they condemn children to being second-class citizens. By their craven cynicism they are tearing out the heart of a tradition of liberalism that has freed the slaves and advanced the cause of freedom for centuries. They declare themselves no longer liberals but arch conservatives. </Hansard-Body>

Where are those Liberals to speak out right now? The scariest part of the debate on foot is not the manifestation of age-old bigotry; it is the window on the next 20 years. For make no mistake about it, here we see the commencement of a new type of politics, one that has been slowly emerging since the last election, one that will be characterised by an absence of liberalism, a dominance of right-wing arch conservatism and the drawing of church and state in a trend that pays little regard to the lessons of history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029091"></A>
But there has been no more pitiful contribution than that of the Leader of the Opposition? His was a tragic eulogy of his former self. The subjugation of the Liberal Party is personified by the Leader of the Opposition. Could there be a more stark example of the corruption of the soul? Compare the thoughtful, intelligent and passionate contribution from the member for Surfers Paradise upon the occasion that this parliament considered the reform to stem cell research to his contribution yesterday. His was a sheepish, enfeebled, pathetic attempt to mouth his support for liberalism as he helped turn off the lights. It is a matter of deep regret to this parliament the manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has been transformed into a hardened kernel of his former self in the craven pursuit of power. The forces that have driven reform, fought injustice and supported the individual through the history of time lie at the core of our liberal democracy. Well might they, the opposition, have dropped the term ‘liberal’ from their name for on this day it ceased to have any true meaning. I commend the Attorney-General’s bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (2.37 pm): I rise to speak in this cognate debate of the Surrogacy Bill 2009 and the opposition’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009. It takes a village to raise a child. That is the African proverb. When I think about my own childhood, I was one of the lucky ones to have the village of support in my childhood. I had my parents, I had my grandparents, I had my uncles, aunties, cousins and, most of all, I knew my heritage. I knew where I came from and I knew where I was most probably going. That is a very important part of anybody’s life, and I will talk about that later. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029094"></A>
One comment that was made to me was from a young lady in Hervey Bay who was conceived by a sperm donation. She said, ‘The pain of infertility should not be appeased at the expense of the next generation.’ The bill introduced by the government has missed a very important factor. The government has not taken into account that the decision it is making is without the informed consent of the most silent party of all, the children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029095"></A>
As I stand here today, the problem that I have with this bill is that it is too big. It is not what surrogacy is about, which is infertility. Same-sex and single parent surrogacy and heterosexual surrogacy are two very important issues. Why do we put them together? Is it to blur the line and confuse the process? Is this the Labor government’s tainted template for procuring offspring? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029131"></A>
This is not about gay and lesbian relationships. As the good Lord would have it, gay people are in love and in partnership with somebody of the same sex and, as the good Lord would also have it, they do not have the ability to bear children. The best interests of the child are far greater than the rights of same-sex couples and single persons who may claim to want to be parents of a child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029134"></A>
The very important issue of surrogacy births and the issue of same-sex parent surrogacy should have full and separate analysis and vote. In the past if a couple was infertile and wished to have a child they had only two options: one was to adopt and the other was to remain childless. Because of the limited number of children available for adoption in Australia this meant the couple had to go overseas or remain childless. I sympathise with the hardship of married and de facto heterosexual partners who are unable to have a child. This is how surrogacy was born. A family member often offered a womb, the hub of life, to a sister or a brother so that they could have a baby and experience parenthood too. More often than not the family member would supply the sperm or the eggs for the surrogate. The surrogate gave hope to many people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029135"></A>
This bill is far away from that day, bringing same-sex and single parents into the fray. It is unreasonable to basket them together. For this reason I support the opposition’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill. We have walked a fearful path with surrogacy today and it has been a long road. There have been many moral arguments and debates. We are going to see one day the burden of pregnancy shifting from one person to another. Where are we going? We need to safeguard against this sort of activity. The bill tabled by the government does not meet all the criteria for the protection of people who have no say in it at all: the children. I will not vote for the government’s bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029136"></A>
What authority do I carry in this parliament that would see my vote deny a child’s very basic right of having a mother and a father? Even with IVF in heterosexual relationships we have youth who are facing grim genetic bewilderment, the age-old adage, ‘Who is my mother? Who is my father?’, a question that has been asked with pain and suffering by those who do not know. Movies have been made about it. Books have been written about the lifelong yearning and the search for biological parents who have been lost. Does this bill create a template of future pain for children? I think it does. To have both parents is to be complete. That is not to say that there are not single parents in our society when one parent has died or as a result of a separation. These children still know who their parents were. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029137"></A>
That brings me to another problem that I have with this bill, and that is the issue of single parenthood contained within it. There is no upper limit on the age of a surrogate. I think there should be. All religious groups and God-fearing people are opposed to this bill. I have heard government members in their speeches acknowledge that they raise extreme emotional debate. It is an emotional debate. I have never had so many emails come into my office. They were still coming in as late as lunchtime today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029138"></A>
To summarise my argument as to why I speak against the government’s surrogacy bill, in particular same-sex surrogacy, while many women over the years have acted as surrogates and have had very fulfilling experiences, many have encountered difficulties with relinquishing issues and family members not understanding or agreeing with the actions that they have taken. Same-sex surrogacy will bring a whole new set of barriers and concerns. Looking into the future, about 20 years from now will the Prime Minister or the Premier of the day be apologising to the surrogate children as we have apologised to the stolen generation and the war orphans? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029139"></A>
Most adopted children want to know their biological parents. Surrogate children will want to do the same. How will they find their biological parents, for instance, if they have a surrogate mother, an egg donor, a sperm donor and then the couple who are the parents of the children? As one of the members from across the floor said, these children will need counselling in the future due to the anguish that they will go through. I agree with that. We need to make sure that this legislation protects the child’s right to know where he or she comes from. I believe this will open a Pandora’s box. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029140"></A>
What about the rights of the surrogate mother? Later in life she might want to meet the child she delivered. What about the donors? Do they really want to know or be contacted by children? These are some of the things I believe we have to look at in the future. I cannot support the government’s bill. I support the opposition’s Family (Surrogacy) Bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (2.40 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate of the Family (Surrogacy) Bill and Surrogacy Bill 2009 and to put my views on the record. My views have been developed following much soul searching and much reading of the views of a large cross-section of the broader community. I cannot in all conscience accept that a social need, in my interpretation of that term, is without any doubt in the best interests of a child. The fact that there are cases put forward where a child being reared in a same-sex relationship has been successful does not provide a basis of proof that a child coming into the world under those circumstances will be successful. Nor is it the case that because there are children being successfully reared in a single-parent household that is proof that rearing a child brought into the world intentionally through surrogacy arrangements in a single-parent household will be successful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029143"></A>
A child has one chance at childhood. It is up to us as legislators to ensure that that chance is the best one possible in these very special circumstances. Once all the medical options have been canvassed and those options ruled out and rigorous testing has confirmed there is no chance, then and only then, in my view, should altruistic surrogacy be viewed as appropriate and only in circumstances where a mum and dad are the parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029144"></A>
I can imagine a case where a woman chooses not to have a child for social reasons, not medical reasons. It may be that the woman has a career and does not want a break in that career that carrying and giving birth to a child may cause. In that case it is for convenience. I do not believe that that social need is acceptable. That is not a good reason for an altruistic surrogacy option to be used. This concept is not acceptable to me as it smacks of self-interest and that is not what altruistic surrogacy is about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029145"></A>
The gift of a child is just that: a gift. It is not a right. The thought that a child is made to fulfil the want of a man or woman as a convenience is totally unacceptable to me. So we come down to needs and wants: the need to use altruistic surrogacy for genuine and proven medical reasons as opposed to wanting to use surrogacy for a social or convenient purpose. There is a vast difference between these two points and that is at the crux of this matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029146"></A>
I oppose the Surrogacy Bill 2009 because of what it does not do--and that is it does not put the interests of the child first. If the Surrogacy Bill 2009 is voted into law today, it will be my view that should the LNP gain government we will undo the wrong of the bill’s current form. We will bring the best interests of the child back to the fore. I support the Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009, introduced by the LNP, because it does put the child first. I commend that bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (2.49 pm): It is sad in some ways that we are debating this legislation in this House at this point in time. I believe that we should not even be debating such a subject. However, I want to start my contribution here this afternoon by making reference to a comment made by the honourable member for Bulimba in her contribution before lunch today. I have great respect for the honourable member for Bulimba. She mentioned talking to children at one of the schools in her electorate about making laws and the sorts of laws we should make. One of the children said--and we know that children are so innocent, open and honest--‘laws to make sure kids get looked after’. I think that is a very open and honest appraisal of what we should be doing in relation to our responsibility as legislators. All of us have to reflect on what children think about, how they look at their lives and what our responsibility is towards them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029177"></A>
The cognate bills, the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill, we are talking about here today are two totally different pieces of legislation. One issue that we are debating is the government allowing same-sex couples to adopt children--something that I totally cannot agree with. The other issue is about surrogacy, where a lady can carry a child for another couple. I do not have a problem with that. </Hansard-Body>

We look at our own families. I know that I am very blessed. I have three healthy children and I am very blessed to have four beautiful little granddaughters. I think the most important thing in our lives is how sacred our children are and how sacred the family is. I have heard various comments from members in this parliament over the course of yesterday and today, and I respect those comments because we have all come from different backgrounds. I was very blessed. I had a wonderful childhood and a wonderful upbringing. I grew up in a good Christian environment, and I hope I have done the right thing. I know that some people have done it a bit tough, and there are a lot of people out there still doing it tough. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029179"></A>
Today we are talking about giving single people an opportunity to have children. I think there are probably a lot of single parents out there who, through no fault of their own, are in that predicament and who are doing a good job of raising and looking after children. But the most healthy aspect of the environment we live in today is the complete family unit--the unit where there is a mother and a father who are there looking after their children, watching their children grow, teaching them discipline, showing them love, showing them respect and teaching them the rights and wrongs in life. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029180"></A>
I reflected on the comments made by my colleague the member for Southern Downs--a very forthright and well thought through speech--and also those made by the honourable member for Condamine, Raymond Hopper. I have to say that Mr Hopper made a lot of valuable comments yesterday--comments that I believe we reflect on as a family in our day-to-day lives. We have talked about issues in relation to children growing up in an environment where they are on their own, but when we talk about same-sex couples having children--and I heard the comments of the member for Hervey Bay a moment ago--we should look at the psychological problems that some of those children could be subjected to. </Hansard-Body>

Yes, I am a Catholic. I was reared in the Catholic faith. I am a Christian more than anything. I have said things in this House in the past that I am not proud of in relation to some of these issues, but I have seen the ill of my ways and apologised to those people in question. One thing I will say here today is that the most sacred thing on the planet is the female body. Women are the mothers, the ones who carry our children regardless, and I believe that we as fathers, husbands, partners or whatever have a right to protect the family unit. In my case, I protect my family and look after them, and I think that is the case for most children today. Children are sacred. The family unit is sacred. The de facto couple who have children is another sacred unit. I do not have a problem with that. The real issue is here in this bill. I ask members of the government who will be supporting the government’s legislation in relation to same-sex couples and singles being able to adopt children to look very closely at what the consequences will be. </Hansard-Body>

Today I was talking to a group about an interesting Galaxy survey in the paper which said that 84 per cent of people support the LNP’s concept and that in Labor electorates it is up to 90 per cent. Labor electorates are no different from any other electorate. They are basically traditional family electorates. They consist of large numbers of families and large numbers of children. I quote from a letter from the Reverend John Bathersby, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. He quotes Pope Benedict XVI, who said to the Pontifical Council for the Family--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1029189"></A>
The best chance children have of developing properly is found in a family because of the uniquely complementary roles played by husband and wife ... they need to dwell, grow and live with both parents, because the maternal and paternal figures complement one another in the education of children and the formation of their personality and identity. It is important, then, that everything possible be done to ensure they grow up in a united and stable family. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As we move into the 21st century we are seeing ideals change and social change, and there are issues that we agree on and disagree on in this House. But I ask members of the government to contemplate their vote and make certain their conscience is absolutely clear. I respect each and every member of this parliament, and I respect the rights of members of this parliament. But I also respect the most vulnerable people in our society, and that is our children. Those children will grow up one day to be adults. They will be the future leaders. They will be the future mums and dads. Our kids are the most worthwhile natural resource we have. So I ask members here today to spare the family and think about what is happening. In relation to what some members will say and do in voting here this evening, I hope their conscience lets them vote the right way. All I can say is: God bless the family unit and God bless you in making the right decision. <Hansard-Speech-End>

As was made clear in our submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry, the Catholic Church does not object to decriminalising altruistic surrogacy as regards the surrogate mother and the commissioning parents.

The Catholic Church finds it difficult to support legislation which places a child in a situation where there is no mother and father as would normally be expected. It is difficult to know in advance the impact such legislation may have on children, or the damage it may do to the institution of the family which is the foundation of our society. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I am not saying that a gay couple cannot be a happy couple together, but the cold reality of life is that two men cannot bear a child, two women cannot bear a child. This goes against the natural order of things. I am following my belief and I am following the belief of many people who have contacted me. I ask all members to look at this. We change a lot of things through society. Members need to think about what is going to occur in 20 or 30 years. Will these children have a normal upbringing? Will their life be good? Will they have the opportunities that we have all had? I ask people to think about that. I appreciate the time of the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (3.03 pm): I rise to briefly make a contribution to the surrogacy bills before the House this afternoon. Firstly, I will be supporting the bill that was brought into this House by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Queensland. I totally support the speech that he made in the House. I thought he summarised my views very well. Obviously, from those comments, I cannot support the legislation that the government has brought before the House and which we are discussing this afternoon.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029244"></A>
I would like to quickly go back to where we were before this legislation came into the House when we appointed a select committee of the parliament to investigate and report back on surrogacy. My understanding is that the basic issue before that committee was the decriminalising of altruistic surrogacy. From that, the government--through the auspices of the loony left--has extended it out to the situation that we see before the House today in the government’s legislation. I guess the very extreme of the legislation is the possibility of a single man having a surrogate baby. I think that is one step too far. Maybe somewhere down the track we could come to that, but what has happened in this parliament at this time is that we have gone backwards rather than forwards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029245"></A>
I totally agree with and totally support the fact that we should be decriminalising altruistic surrogacy, and that is exactly what the LNP bill before this House was going to do. The comments which have been made by the members on this side of the House totally bear out that position. I take on board the letter that was written by Archbishop Bathersby to all members of parliament. His words should obviously be taken into consideration because I believe this parliament is based on Christian beliefs. I believe he is expressing very strong Christian beliefs on behalf of all of us and all the people we represent in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029246"></A>
I do not intend to make any more comments, except to say that I think the government legislation has obviously gone way too far. There are certainly a lot of people--and I am sure half of them have contacted my office--who are absolutely out of their tree in regard to the legislation before the House today. I will not be supporting the government’s legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (3.05 pm): When the matter of altruistic surrogacy was first brought before this House with the development of a select committee, this side of the House, the LNP, very genuinely and very sincerely entered into that process. We appointed two highly respected women members from our side of the House--the member for Currumbin and the member for Burdekin--to represent us on that committee. That committee was ostensibly, as we all understood it, about looking into the decriminalisation of surrogacy, and the committee members heard some anecdotes and stories about the sadness felt by some people who were endeavouring to have children. There is no doubt in my mind that all of us on this side were very keen to see that some kindness, thought and care was shown to couples who were trying to have children but for medical, physical or genetic reasons were not able to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029249"></A>
I heard the Premier yesterday read out one particular story, and that was exactly the type of situation that we were all thinking about and all believed and thought this select committee was about. I have no doubt that is what our two representatives--the member for Currumbin and the member for Burdekin--thought as they ventured through the process in 2008 and 2009 and deliberated very carefully on this matter. What we have before us today in the government’s Surrogacy Bill moves far away from the proposed purpose of that committee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029250"></A>
People who are involved in various fertilisation processes that have come about through increased technology often go through extremely difficult processes, mentally and physically, in their endeavour to have a child, but they do it because of their desire to have a child and their desire to raise in a loving way the next generation. Surrogacy is taking that technology to another level from what those childless couples had been facing. Surrogacy takes the moral dilemmas, the dilemmas of parenthood and guardianship and all of those particular issues and complications another step further.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029251"></A>
On top of all that, we now have the government introducing a bill into which it has inserted clauses that provide for altruistic surrogacy for same-sex couples and single people. On that basis, we will be opposing that particular bill. Our shadow minister introduced a private member’s bill that in most ways mirrors the bill put forward by the government but it proposes significant amendments in two key areas. The first is whether the District Court or the Supreme Court is used in certain judgement processes. The other key area is that the Family (Surrogacy) Bill put forward by the LNP does not allow surrogacy for same-sex couples or single people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029287"></A>
That has been the nub of the whole argument over the last two days. Members on both sides of the House have mostly been talking in a genuine way about this. I know there has been some vitriol at times, but most members have been genuine in endeavouring to get to the nub of the whole question, and that is the rights of the child. I think everybody agrees that we do know of circumstances where children are in a single-parent family and have been brought up with great love and care. That situation mostly has come about through tragedy, death, divorce or unhappiness in their marriage. Likewise, most of us know of same-sex couples--mostly women--who have children who are happy and who are loved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029290"></A>
What we need to do in this House is set a template or a head of power for the bills and the acts that we debate and analyse in this House. This government bill sets a head of power for altruistic surrogacy with all its complications and all its difficulties that may arise in the future to be available to not only heterosexual couples who are unable to have a child for medical reasons but also people who have made a lifestyle choice--that is, same-sex couples or singles. We on this side philosophically and strongly oppose that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029291"></A>
In setting a head of power in this bill and a template for the future, we have to aim to achieve the best. That is why we believe very strongly that the rights of the child are paramount. The rights of the child are ultimately and best served by having a father and a mother. In the mid-1990s when I was health minister I had never seriously turned my mind to this question, nor had I needed to. But one day I went to turn a sod for the new Noosa Hospital and I turned the corner and saw all the press gallery there. I thought that this was unusual for the turning of a sod for a hospital. They were there to question me about a decision that had been made in the court regarding IVF for same-sex couples. Caught in the spur of the moment at that time, I had to think immediately about what I thought and what I believed my community thought. I said at the time that every child deserves a mother and a father. That debate was carried on BBC and other areas of the world as well as Australia, but I still believe that and I strongly believe it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029292"></A>
If we are to set a template or a head of power that provides the ultimate for children, and we are concerned about the rights of the child, then it is not right for the government to step in, sanction and legislate for same-sex couples to be able to use a surrogacy arrangement to have a child--whether that is two men or two women or, as the legislation also says, a single person. Imagine a little boy growing up not having the opportunity of a father all through those years to look after him and carry him around as a babe, to muck around and wrestle with him, to teach him to play cricket or footy or fencing, to take him fishing--all the things that fathers and sons do. As a teenage boy he would not have his father there as an adviser and a mentor. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We always get interjections from the other side saying, ‘What about the drunks? What about domestic violence?’ There will be a percentage of that in any arrangement. We are trying to provide in this bill the best and the ultimate and to provide for the rights of the child. What about young girls growing up without a father to put a strong arm around their shoulder and provide them with security throughout their life? They will not have a father to walk them down the aisle one day, who will love them and be sad at giving them away in marriage. Let me take it a step further. The children of these children will be denied a grandfather and a grandmother in these particular circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029297"></A>
I feel so strongly about this particular issue. It is a huge responsibility upon this House, because we have a very big decision to make about this piece of government legislation that is before us. Are we going to allow these designer arrangements to be put in place? Is it going to be about the wants of people who are unable to have children because they are in a same-sex relationship or because they are single, or is it going to be about thinking deeply about children and wanting to have the best for them so that from the day they are born they have the opportunity to have a mother and a father, and that opportunity has not been deliberately denied to them from the time of their conception? That is the nub of this argument. That is why we will be opposing this particular bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029298"></A>
The bill put forward by the shadow Attorney-General, as I said, mirrored almost all of the government’s bill bar the issue of the District Court versus the Supreme Court and the issue of surrogacy being available to same-sex couples and single people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029299"></A>
My colleague and friend the member for Toowoomba North mentioned his concern about a lack of counselling and the need for counselling that would arise. I would think that in the case of altruistic surrogacy for heterosexual couples the need for counselling would be slight because they are the biological parents. A child would have two biological parents, a mother and a father. It is obvious that my colleague sees that altruistic surrogacy for same-sex couples and singles is going to provide particular difficulties for young people as they grow up through their adolescent years, through their days at school and so forth. He can obviously see the need for counselling. I think that only goes to show that what we would be passing if we pass the government bill in its entirety would be below the optimum for young children, because right from the very start we are putting significant problems and difficulties on every little step of their lives that they will take as they go through their young years, their adolescent years and their grown-up years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029300"></A>
I will be voting against the government’s bill. I will be voting for our bill. If it is defeated, then I will certainly be supporting the amendments that this side of the House will be moving. I believe the private member’s bill of the LNP provides compassion and care for those who wish to undertake altruistic surrogacy who are in a heterosexual and loving relationship. Our bill protects our society from having a system of designer arrangements whereby same-sex couples and singles can arrange for a surrogacy arrangement, with all the consequent complications.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029301"></A>
I do not believe that the government has the right to interfere in the most sacred, sacrosanct principle of life that is aspired to by families, by over 86 per cent of our society, by churches and by many philosophers and ethicists--that is, that every child deserves the opportunity at the outset to have a mother and father. That opportunity should never be broken by the legislative pen of a government. We will be opposing the government’s bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.20 pm): I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009. At the outset, I thank the Premier for allowing a conscience vote on both bills. According to the Attorney-General, someone I have a lot of respect for, the Surrogacy Bill allows parties to enter into altruistic surrogacy arrangements where a woman agrees to conceive and carry a child for another person or another person and that person’s spouse. That in itself is a challenging proposition. But the bill goes further than that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029332"></A>
After much consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible for me to support this bill in its entirety without severely compromising my conscience. I have therefore informed the Premier and the Attorney-General that I am unable to support the bill in its current form. It is never easy to disagree with colleagues that I have not only worked with but, in fact, with whom I share a lot of common values. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029333"></A>
At times even the best of friends disagree. This is neither a decision that I have taken lightly nor an easy one for me to make. But I must do the right thing according to my conscience and do the right thing because it is right, at least in my own mind. In doing so, I absolutely respect the conscience of my colleagues which may be different to mine. I ask therefore that my conscience be respected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029334"></A>
It is necessary for me to state my case and the reasons behind my decision. In doing so, I will make comments that some will disagree with. I apologise in advance if my comments are offensive in any way. They are not intended to be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029335"></A>
I have received calls, emails and correspondence from those supporting or opposing the bill. I am very disappointed in some of the language used. No, those in same-sex relationships are not lesser in worth or value, let alone evil. Just because they are gay does not mean they are less deserving of being listened to and respected as equal to me as fellow human beings. No, those who have expressed concern with this legislation are not necessarily homophobic, ridden with hate or religious bigots. And to the person who called and wished the demise of my children I say: I will continue to serve you and my community irrespective of your political affiliation, sexual preference or creed. And to the person who congratulated me for my stand but went on to call the Premier names that I could not repeat to my children: I thank you for your message of support, but should there come a point in time when my opinion differs from yours what names will you call me then? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029336"></A>
We live in a democracy, and with that comes the ability to speak freely. But free speech is not free. It never is. It has a price. We pay the price every time someone wrongly accuses us. As politicians we are blessed with plenty of that experience. We also pay that price every time we strongly disagree with someone and yet treat that person with the respect and dignity that we ourselves expect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029337"></A>
So to those who disagree with me and yet only seek my understanding, I thank you. To those who agree with me and yet express concern for the wellbeing of those with views that they could not possibly support, I thank you also. Thank you for paying the price for our democracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029338"></A>
Debates on a moral issue should never be divided on political lines. Matters of this nature should always be subject to our conscience. That is why I am disappointed with some of the language used so far in this debate. I am particularly disappointed with the LNP as it has prohibited its members a conscience vote. I will be watching with interest whether anyone from the other side votes in any way different from the rest of their political colleagues. To have 38 highly opinionated people--and that is what we are by nature as politicians--share the same opinion on a matter of conscience is beyond belief. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029339"></A>
The Premier has allowed a conscience vote for all Labor members knowing that the vote may be lost. I may disagree with her on some part of this bill, but I respect and admire her determination to do what she thinks is right in her mind. I call for the opposition to have the same courage and courtesy to allow its members to do the same. There is no such thing as a corporate conscience and never should be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029340"></A>
I have difficulties with surrogacy, primarily the concern that it is a practice which involves a premeditated intention to separate a child from his or her birth mother. Notwithstanding the fact that I have strong concerns for the wellbeing of the child conceived in this arrangement, I think I may be able to be persuaded to support a very limited form of altruistic surrogacy as an absolute last resort for infertile couples and only after all other available means are exhausted. I also agree that it is not in the interests of an innocent child for his non-birth parents to be imprisoned. The configuration of a child’s family is not his or her fault. Children should not be punished and disadvantaged because of this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029341"></A>
Such protection can be largely achieved by amending existing laws. The Surrogate Parenthood Act 1988 can be repealed and changes to existing surrogacy laws can be made to provide the protection that this bill seeks to achieve. I am happy to enact any law to ensure children of any family of any configuration are equal. I have been advised that, although messy, this can be done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029342"></A>
My concern with the Surrogacy Bill is that it also allows and in fact predestines an unborn child into a family with one parent or parents of one gender. My conscience tells me that the interests of a child are best served with a male and a female in the family as role models if it is at all possible. I know that it is not always possible with life, but it is possible if we are starting with a clean sheet of paper and we are evaluating a child’s family before birth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029343"></A>
I believe that legislation should have three principal objectives. Firstly, legislation is enacted to protect a person from another. The Criminal Code and corporate laws are examples of this type of legislation. Secondly, legislation is enacted to protect a person from overinvasive government. In a democracy this is very important. The provision of a Public Interest Monitor in a debate during the last sitting of parliament when we legislated to give more power to the police is a classic example of this principle. The third objective--and this is the hardest to do--is to enact legislation to protect a person from himself or herself. This largely involves moral issues such as euthanasia and similar matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029345"></A>
On a different but equally important spectrum, it is absolutely critical that in a modern pluralistic democracy such as ours the opinions and aspirations of an individual should not only be respected but also accepted and cherished. It has to be said, though, that respecting, accepting and cherishing others does not mean that we are in agreement with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029346"></A>
In addition, people, irrespective of their gender, religion, creed, culture, marital status and sexual preference, should be treated equally in a fair and just society. Equality is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. These are fundamental core values of our society, or at least a society that we aspire to. However, it does not take a scholar in law to quickly realise that what I have mentioned before at times can be mutually exclusive in that they cannot and in effect must not co-exist at the same time in some circumstances. For example, notwithstanding that one’s liberty and freedom is respected as a fundamental human right, one is never allowed to do whatever one pleases. I cannot whack someone on the head, no matter how tempting it may be at times, just because I am exercising my individual freedom. The law limits my freedom to do so to protect others from me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032327"></A>
We cannot drive as fast as we please without consequences--and I should know better than anybody else--or drive under the influence of alcohol without ramifications. Do I have the right to drink? Yes, I do. But when the wellbeing of others is taken into consideration, their need to be protected is considered far more important than my right to drink and, as a consequence, my liberty and freedom are curtailed accordingly. The law has always protected the interests of the passive innocent first and foremost, and rightly so. In terms of the right of a single person or same-sex people to have children, the desire to be treated equally is acknowledged. One can understand that a single or gay person would like to have the same entitlement and right as someone in, say, a traditional marriage, and in most cases I am in absolute agreement. However, in the case of surrogacy, the overriding consideration ought to be the interests of the child, as it is repeated many times by all sides of this argument. But the debate so far has concentrated on the right of the children after birth to be treated equally, as it is not their doing that their parents are gay or single. I absolutely agree that children should not be treated differently to, say, my children, irrespective of their parents’ marital status or sexual preferences. That is why we have enacted legislation such as the succession laws during the last parliament and should continue to do so whenever the need arises. But what about the interests of the child before birth, or at least at birth? Do we have a responsibility to this person who does not even yet have an identity, let alone a name?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032330"></A>
Before I continue, it is important that I make the following point. Firstly, I believe it is in the interests of this debate to have the argument based on an ‘all things being equal’ basis. It is not helpful to debate this bill and to ask questions such as whether a child is better off in a loving same-sex relationship or one with an abusive father and an alcoholic mother. It also adds no credit to this debate by asking to choose between a gay couple in a casual relationship and a devoted heterosexual couple in a married relationship for 30 years. The answer is clear. Who would want to live in an abusive relationship? In the absence of love and stability, one is clearly better than the other. But what happens if love, care and stability exist for both the same-sex and heterosexual couples? If the screening process is the same and the criteria are the same, one has to assume that both sets of candidates are equal in their ability to love and to care for the unborn child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032331"></A>
The question that then ought to be asked is, with all things being equal, would a child be better off raised in a family of two parents with both genders present? Some will say that it makes no difference. I respect that. I say it does, all things being equal. I believe in my conscience that children develop best, both physically and emotionally, when they are reared in a stable family with both male and female role models available, notwithstanding that this is not always possible. This is not to say that same-sex or single parents cannot be good parents; quite the opposite. Even those advocating for same-sex parenting accept the importance of role models but seek only to argue that perhaps ‘other positive role models can be found elsewhere such as scout leaders, school teachers and sport coaches’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032333"></A>
I understand that there are many role models in our lives, but I also believe that, if at all possible, parents are the best role models available for the development of their children, all things being equal. Outsourcing role models as a primary position to me is less than ideal, particularly when we do not have to. Role modelling to me is not just about setting aside some time to talk to a child on an issue. It is not just being there for the child when the child is in need. It is about being observed by a child at home as to how we as a parent behave when we are least on our guard. It is about how a husband treats his wife when no-one is watching that teaches a boy what respecting a woman means. It is about how a mother talks at home that teaches the child what manners mean. It is best that it be in-house, not outsourced.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032334"></A>
My question to myself was this: is it our role to make laws so that children are predestined into a situation such that external help for role models is not only acknowledged, as required, but needed, even before they are born? We have to think from the point of view not of a mother or a father but a child. If we had our choice to start with a clean sheet of paper, and all things being equal, that our father and our mother--perhaps in contrast to real life--are in fact loving, caring and able, would we like them to be our role model at home, or would we prefer Mary Smith the scout leader and John Citizen the sporting coach, with respect to scout leaders and coaches?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032335"></A>
I have always stood up for the right of an adult to make their own decision on all matters pertaining to their own affairs on the basis that everyone involved makes a conscious decision to do so of their own free will and no third party is being disadvantaged without their consent. It is not my place as a legislator to impose my personal view on other people. In fact, I have in the past and will always be prepared to support legislation which gives same-sex people fundamental rights to be respected. However, when the welfare of children is concerned, I make no apologies for leaning to the interests of the children not only after they are born but before they are born, because, essentially, this is what we are dealing with here. Some argue that this is already happening and same-sex people or single individuals can make arrangements for the sole purpose of securing a baby.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032336"></A>
Politics is the art of what is possible. In a sea of different opinions, diverse agendas and conflicting interests, we have learned to make compromises as long as the benefits outweigh the cost, and for some this is an acceptable compromise, and I absolutely respect that. But, to me, the line in the sand has just been crossed. Expediency is not a sufficient argument in exchange for the wellbeing of children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032337"></A>
In closing, may I take this chance to get a subject off my chest that has been bothering me for quite some time. I absolutely agree with the quest for equality in that men and women are equal in their worth and that people should be treated equally, irrespective of, as I said before, marital status, culture, creed, colour, religion and sexual preference. I am the last person people should accuse of discrimination. I probably have my fair share of stories about discrimination, and only a very small handful of people in this House know those stories. However, I feel compelled to say that when we seek equality we must remember one thing: that equality of worth is not the same as equality of role and equality of identity. Men and women are equal in terms of our worth and our value. But it would be wrong, in my humble opinion, to say that therefore men and women are equal in our roles, let alone in our identities. In that I am not referring to cooking and ironing, and I was indeed horrified with the stereotypical comments made by Tony Abbott a few days ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032338"></A>
I also want to state that a lot of traditional roles are imposed upon women by men in a culture of supremacy and dominance. To the women fighting for justice and equality, can I say that I am sorry for the wrongs committed and I will stand with you every minute, every day, every week with every single fibre of my being to fight that injustice. It would be sad, in my view, in the quest to be treated the same that my female equals ignore the fact that they are better than men in many aspects of life. May I say with the greatest humility that we as men also have a thing or two that we perhaps do ever so slightly better. We both have our strengths and our weaknesses, and we ignore them to the detriment of ourselves, our family and our community.</Hansard-Body>

It has been said that surrogacy is a human rights issue, and it is. But whose rights are we talking about: the right of anyone to have a child, or the right of the child to start life with an in-house mum and dad as role models, all things being equal? Friends and colleagues, it is simply impossible to support one without inadvertently diminishing the other. I wish so much it could.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (3.39 pm): I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill. In doing so, I would like to firstly thank the Premier for allowing government members to exercise a conscience vote. The Premier recognises that some members of her caucus hold strong, but different, views from her government on the proposed surrogacy reforms. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, the Premier is not afraid to let her members exercise their conscience on this important, but controversial issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032370"></A>
Conscience votes, or free votes as they are called in some parliaments around the world, are extremely rare. In fact, in the Queensland parliament over the past 30 years there has been only three occasions where members of the Labor Party have been given a conscience vote. As a member elected in 2001, I have had the privilege to participate in a debate on two bills where a conscience vote was allowed, with both bills relating to stem cell research. I recall how impressed I was in 2003 when, as a first termer, the controversial issue of the regulation of research on stem cells was debated in this parliament. However, I doubt if the first termers of the 2009 parliament will be as equally impressed by the calibre of the debate we have witnessed. The dignified debate of 2003 demonstrated a high degree of tolerance for the differences that were held between members of parliament and showed the maturity of that parliament in debating such a significant and emotive issue whilst at the same time showing respect for opposing views. Sadly, the unnecessarily provocative language used by some Liberal National Party members does nothing to add to the dignity of the parliament as we discuss and debate this controversial topic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032371"></A>
The explanatory notes for the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill make it clear that the primary objectives of both bills are broadly similar and are based on the recommendations from a report by the Investigation into Altruistic Surrogacy Committee, tabled in the Legislative Assembly on 8 October 2008. The major objectives of both bills is to decriminalise altruistic surrogacy and to provide a legal mechanism for the transfer of parentage of a child born as a result of an altruistic surrogacy arrangement from the birth mother to the intended parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032373"></A>
Following amendments to the surrogacy law, both bills also seek to repeal the Surrogate Parenthood Act 1988 and make related amendments to various acts. Where the bills divide substantively is on the definition of eligibility of who may enter into a surrogacy arrangement. The government’s bill proposes that there be no restrictions on who may become a parent through surrogacy and anyone who wants to be a parent has the opportunity and, indeed, the right to do so. This means that a couple, either married or de facto, same sex or heterosexual, or a single person, male or female, may be the intended parent or parents in a surrogacy arrangement and subsequently apply for a parentage order from a court. On the other hand, the Family (Surrogacy) Bill restricts those who can enter into altruistic surrogacy to married or de facto heterosexual couples.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032375"></A>
At the outset, like other members, I support the objective of both bills, which seek to prohibit commercial surrogacy and to decriminalise altruistic surrogacy. To me, entering into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement by the intending parents and surrogate mother should never have been a criminal offence. Its removal from the Queensland Criminal Code is well overdue and I welcome it. From a moral and ethical perspective, I have found the process of coming to a decision on where I stand on the conscience vote enormously difficult and challenging. After giving very careful and lengthy consideration, I have informed the Premier and the Attorney-General that, although I support the objects of decriminalising altruistic surrogacy, my conscience does not allow me to support the widening of the eligibility of surrogate parents to include single and same-sex couples. Despite the fact that they certainly do not agree with my views, I have been most impressed with the respect and courtesy that the Premier and Attorney-General have provided to me in exercising my conscience vote. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032376"></A>
As we have heard over the past two days, my government colleagues who support the Surrogacy Bill have judged that it adequately protects a child’s best interests. In doing so, their argument is based on two assumptions--and assumptions about which I have concerns. Firstly, there is the assumption and the acceptance of the recommendations of the parliamentary committee’s report, which states that the Queensland government’s role should be to develop a legislative and regulatory framework for surrogacy that balances the protection of vulnerable people from harm with, on the other hand, the promotion of liberty of consenting adults. Secondly, in widening the eligibility criteria for intending surrogate parents, the bill is based on the assumption that all forms of family types are equally beneficial to a child’s wellbeing. Whether the family unit is a heterosexual, married or de facto couple, same-sex couple or single person, male or female, the bill judges all types to be equally beneficial to the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032377"></A>
It is at this stage that I exercise my conscience in ascertaining whether I can agree with these two principles--a decision that I have not come to easily. I am reminded by the Catholic priest and ethicist, Norman Ford, that the act of conscience is not an act of choice but the act of the intellect based on my social, cultural and religious background in judging the moral truth of a proposed action. Since choice does not for me play a role in a judgement of my conscience, I must obey my conscience and must vote accordingly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032379"></A>
I have come to a moral conclusion by informing myself as much as I can of the issues. I have conducted careful research and appreciate very much the generous sharing of views from friends, constituents, families who hope to be involved in a surrogate arrangement, church and religious leaders and wider community members. Like other members, I have received letters from Archbishop Bathersby and the Family Council of Queensland, urging that I vote according to the best interests of the children and not the best interests of adults who wish to be parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032383"></A>
Author Tom Frame reminds me that the first concern of parenthood must always be the promotion of the best interests of children. This is reflected in the United Nations preamble to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, recognising that the child, by reason of his or her physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection before as well as after birth. This principle is restated in the preamble to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which Australia is a signatory, declaring that the best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration. Whilst others will disagree, my conscience urges me to hold that there is a hierarchy of rights, with the rights of vulnerable children as the primary one. That is, the rights of children come before the rights of people wishing to become parents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032386"></A>
I do not accept, as the parliamentary committee argues, that as a legislator I must strike a balance between the best interests and wellbeing of a child and on the other hand those people who are seeking to become parents through altruistic surrogacy arrangements. Nor do I accept that the interests of the child and that the interests of the parent compete and that a child’s interests need to be harmonised with those of adults who wish to become parents through surrogacy. To me, such an argument is completely contrary to the intentions of the UN convention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032387"></A>
In moving to the second premise of the bill, I argue that, given that the best interests of children are to me paramount, I recognise that single people and same-sex couples are able to love and care for a child. Today, all around Queensland single mothers and fathers are doing a great job raising their children but, unlike the objectives of the Surrogacy Bill, most have become single parents by accident rather than by design. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035423"></A>
I do not agree that the important different and complementary roles that mothers and fathers play in raising their children can be legislated away. I have not been convinced by the limited research that states that single or same-sex parenting provides equally as beneficial outcomes for children as those raised by a mother and father. In my own literature review of the research, I question the objectivity, independence and methodology of such research that has been conducted by vested interest groups from both sides of the argument. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035426"></A>
Some honourable members have raised concerns about the potential for discrimination against children who are already born into single-person or same-sex surrogacy arrangements or those children who might be in the future. I would like to make a few points in response. Firstly, the fact that singles and same-sex couples are currently entering into surrogacy arrangements to access children does not represent to me a compelling reason to introduce a new law to further provide accessibility. To me, my duty as a member of parliament, with the responsibility of voting according to my conscience, is to positively consider whether single and same-sex surrogacy arrangements are actually in the best interests of children, and that is what I have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035427"></A>
I do agree with my colleagues that children born into same-sex and single surrogacy arrangements should not be further disadvantaged simply because of the actions of adults. The rights of children who are or will be born in the future in these circumstances in my view should be vigorously advocated where possible by this parliament. For example, an alternative measure could include amendments to the Succession Act to provide for succession rights for children born into surrogacy arrangements in the same way that the Succession Act was amended to recognise stepchildren. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035428"></A>
Existing legislation already protects the parenting arrangements of children born into single and same-sex surrogacy arrangements without the need for the intervention of this bill. Section 65C of the Commonwealth Family Law Act 1975 allows any person, whether they are biologically related to a child or not, to apply for parenting orders where the person is concerned with the care, welfare or development of a child. Recently a federal magistrate considered that two same-sex men who had no biological connection with the child could apply under this section for a parenting order because they were concerned with the care of the child. Therefore, if a court found that it was in the best interests of a child, it would be possible for a single person or a same-sex couple to obtain a parenting order without the need for the parliament to expressly approve of these arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035429"></A>
In my view, it cannot be reasonably argued that this bill is the only means of protecting the rights of children born to single and same-sex surrogacy arrangements. Children’s rights do need to be protected, but, as I have outlined, there are mechanisms other than this bill to secure these certainties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035430"></A>
Making the correct judgement of conscience is not something that I have taken lightly, but I must always act in good conscience--that is, in good faith. Shakespeare reminds me: ‘To thine own self be true’. For the reasons outlined this afternoon, although I support the decriminalisation of altruistic surrogacy, in the best interests of the child I will not be supporting the Surrogacy Bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035431"></A>
Finally, I would like to thank the many people who have contacted me and my office recently regarding this debate. Although most have agreed with my ultimate moral conclusions, not all of them have. A few are personally and vehemently opposed to the view that I have come to and have told me so in no uncertain terms. They have told me that I am letting them down. Although I do not agree with their argument that they have an unfettered right to become a parent regardless of marital status or gender, I do support their right to put their views to me strongly and passionately. It has been my duty and responsibility to listen carefully to them with compassion and courtesy in arriving at my final moral stance. I simply ask that my views be equally respected. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Brisbane Central--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.53 pm): I, too, rise to contribute to this cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill 2009, a debate that I believe has been long overdue in Queensland. First of all, let me start by thanking all those who have contacted me with their views and comments. They were very much appreciated and valued, even though I clearly did not agree with them all. In particular, I thank my constituents who took the time to write and call. I received letters from church groups, including a letter from Archbishop John Bathersby, who, in case members do not know, is actually one of my constituents. My daughter played in his backyard, which backs onto the school that she attended. I know the values of the Catholic Church. I also know that, regardless of a child’s family situation, the Catholic Church would never turn its back on any child who wants to attend its school. I have been through the Catholic school system. My daughter is also going through that system at the moment. Even though he expressed some concerns, I know the values of the church are that it will accept a child regardless of their family situation. I also want to thank the many members of the LGBT community, especially PFLAG’s president, Shelley Argent, who took the time to let me know of their views. I assure all that I have not taken this issue lightly and I have considered all input. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035434"></A>
As stated in this House before, surrogacy is not new, happening from biblical times and in the rest of Australia. It is probably happening legally as we debate these bills today. It is probably happening, unfortunately illegally, in Queensland at the moment. I believe that Queenslanders should not be disadvantaged or made to travel interstate, whether one supports it or not, simply to fulfil their desire to have a family. I firmly believe that altruistic surrogacy should not be a criminal offence. I support wholeheartedly its decriminalisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035435"></A>
I do not know who benefits in society by having a law that severely fines or jails parents. How can that be in the best interests of the child? At the time when the child needs their parents--because they were born into this world through no fault of their own--the law currently states that the parents are criminals and that it will jail them and remove them from the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035436"></A>
I concur with the Deputy Premier that the debate in this House to date has appalled me at times. I have found it to be narrow-minded, sometimes just cruel and bordering on bizarre. I believe that it is probably based on ignorance and prejudice. I refer specifically to the issue of toileting of children by two women or two men and, of course, the bizarre linking of this issue to the Stolen Generation. I believe that this is both insulting and disrespectful to the Stolen Generation and demonstrates a gross lack of understanding of the pain and suffering of the Stolen Generation. How do you compare the forced removal of children with consensual arrangements made between adults where the birth mother may not have any biological ties to the child born and will, under Labor’s bill, have the final say about the arrangement going forward? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035437"></A>
This is an important issue and there are some important points that I wish to make. Whether you support altruistic surrogacy or not, I do not believe that it should be a criminal offence for any person wishing to have a family, particularly where the decision is being made between consenting adults fully aware of the situation and where the gift of a child is given altruistically by a woman. An example is the case of the cousin of Jodie Hodgson that we saw outlined in this morning’s paper. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035438"></A>
My story is a somewhat interesting one when it comes to this issue. Members can tell that I am very passionate about this issue. Unfortunately, my husband and I found ourselves in the situation where we were unable to have our own children. It is no surprise to those in this House that I am an adoptive mother--the proud and very loving parent of a most wonderful baby daughter who arrived to us and whom we are still totally and utterly besotted with and love and care for every day of our lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035439"></A>
Having gone through that, I understand probably more than anybody in this House the anguish, heartache and loss and the feeling of wanting to have a child and not being able to do so. This is something that I would not wish on my worst enemies and surely not something that I would want to deny anybody who found themselves with the very strong desires that my husband and I found ourselves with. I believe that those desires would have been just as strong in me whether I was married, single or in any sort of relationship. We were lucky. I was brought up with a mum and dad. I also know the heartache and the anguish that my immediate family went through. I saw it in their faces; I saw it in their hearts. It is something that is inexplicable and it is something that, as I said, one would not wish on one’s worst enemy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038274"></A>
I am very happy that I was able to adopt domestically in Queensland. But I was very resentful of the fact that when I looked at surrogacy I found it to be illegal in this state and that if we pursued it I would have been branded a criminal. I would not have been able to serve on the many boards which I represented workers on. I probably would not have been able to even enter into parliament--all because we simply wanted to have a child. I believe that no-one should have to go through that pain and anguish. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038277"></A>
I also believe that if you come into this world in the very many ways that we enter it you should not be discriminated against or born with any stigma. Why did many parents years ago not tell their children about their adoption? Because of the social stigma often attached to it. How happy am I that my daughter can go to school and live her life free of any stigma because of her adoption and that she is accepted in society today much more willingly than she was many years ago. That is a society I want to be part of. That is a society that my conscience tells me is the right society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038278"></A>
There is a saying that says you cannot pick your family but you can pick your friends. We all know that we want to be proud of our families. Families come in all sorts, shapes and sizes and no-one can choose their family. It is impossible to determine who will or will not be a good parent. Parenting is as individual as we all are, and we should not be stereotyping any children coming from the many forms of families. Of course ideally we would love to have a situation where there is a mother and a father and a loving and caring relationship. But we all know that the reality is that that is not the case in every single circumstance. Let us not bury our heads in the sand in regard to this issue. There are widows and widowers, single parents, divorced parents, step-parents and many parents who I know today in the LGBT community. Good parenting, we all know, is much more than just having kids. Just ask the department of child safety about the many thousands of children in this state who find themselves in difficult and horrible situations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038280"></A>
I also question the questioning, the questionable and often, I found, insulting research which does nothing more than stereotype innocent children who can do little to change their circumstances. Attitudes must change in my view just like attitudes have changed towards single mums, adoptions and, yes, even same-sex couples. No child should be made to feel ashamed or embarrassed or be teased because of the composition of their family. What is important is that they are in a loving and caring environment, nurtured to grow into well-balanced adults and a welcome and happy member of our society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038281"></A>
We talk about equal rights and equality before the law. These are principles that I value and respect very much. Article 1 of the UN declaration of human rights says that all humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights. I respect that article and I also respect the fact that all are equal before the law and are entitled, without any discrimination, to equal protection under the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038282"></A>
I do not believe that the state should be in the business of telling people who should or should not have a child but it should be in the business of regulating to ensure the protection of children. Leaving this area unregulated without safeguards is something that this bill aims to address. These members of society are not criminals and they should not be subject to penalties. I believe that this legislation is in the best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038283"></A>
When assisted reproduction technology is currently available to all but we want to deny some members of society, many of whom are already outstanding parents, this form of assisted reproduction technology, I do not understand the argument. I do not believe that this is a threat to the family values of love, commitment and caring--values able to exercised by all members of our community including single people and members of the LGBT community. I do not believe that it is appropriate for government to impose restrictions based on marital status, gender, sexual orientation or methods of conception and to class certain members of our community as unfit to become parents when I know many who are already wonderful, loving parents and more than able to successfully raise a family. For those who make moral judgements about what is largely people’s own business--harming no-one and who love and feel just like everyone else--they should open their eyes and not let their narrow-minded view of what is ideal cloud reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038285"></A>
There is a big difference between the state placing a child for adoption and adults consenting to altruistic surrogacy. The state has a much more hands-on role in the adoption process to consenting adults agreeing on their situation. I believe that the issue of co-parenting rights goes hand in hand with this issue, and I welcome the Labor bill that provides a legal mechanism for the parentage of a child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement to be transferred from the birth mother to the intended parents. Once again, this is the right role for government and it is encapsulated in regulating how this occurs, requiring the court to issue an order following a number of steps which must be undertaken by the intending parents. However, this merely confirms what children already know regardless of how they were born into this world: they know who their parents are and they know who loves them. But this gives parents legal peace of mind. This is an issue very important to the LGBT community. I know couples in this situation who are eager to be recognised in law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038286"></A>
This was an issue that was raised at the community engagement function hosted by me for the LGBT community in October last year to which all members of parliament were invited. I want to correct the member for Gympie, who said that there were more members of the LNP there than the ALP. That is simply not true. Unlike him, I kept a list and that is simply not the case. May I also add that I probably would not have been able to hold such a function 20 years ago, because 20 years ago homosexuality was illegal. It was a Labor government that legalised that practice and it is a Labor government that has a proud history in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038288"></A>
Present at that function were couples with children. There was a little child running around, and I knew--you felt it--they were being raised in a loving environment. Here we have members on the other side of the House attending that function and they were as transparent as plastic. Yesterday the member for Southern Downs in the debate at 5.30 pm used words against the Premier such as ‘deceit’, ‘betrayal’ and ‘mistrust’. I throw those words back at the member for Southern Downs. While LNP members were all there, rubbing shoulders with that community, desperately trying to win their vote, pretending to be on their side, they were concocting a plan against them while trying to embrace them as if they were a part of that community. They will see through them, they will not be fooled and they will not accept the position that those on the other side are taking today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038289"></A>
I have listened intently to the debate in this House. Basically there is a constant theme. It is based on two main issues: a right for a child to a mum and dad and that babies are not commodities. There have been words used like ‘trophies’, ‘pets’, ‘convenience’, a ‘quick fix’ to gain a family. To suggest that some upstanding members of our community, because of their lifestyle decisions, would be referred to in this manner--to believe that somehow the desire to have a child makes those children a trophy, or a pet, or a commodity--disgusts and appals me. I believe the LGBT community should use those words against the LNP, and whoever used those words, time and time again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038320"></A>
I remember during the last election the member for Southern Downs rewrote history in the gay magazines about what the National Party had done for the gay community.

I remember the words of the member for Cleveland, who said that if the LNP wins the next election it will reverse this.

Let us see the LNP do that at the next election. </Hansard-Body>

There was the member for Southern Downs rewriting history, rubbing shoulders, desperate for votes. Those opposite were doing whatever they could to win the election, yet at the same time they were becoming deceitful and mistrusting. Let me tell those members opposite: members of the gay community will recognise your disingenuousness and insincere attitude towards them and they will punish you at the next election. I will continue to do that as long as I have breath in my body as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I believe I am a fair-minded and practical person and am supportive of all members of our society. I have fought for most of my life against discrimination and prejudice. I have fought for equality and an equal opportunity for all, and I do not intend to stop now. I will exercise my true conscience vote with great care and conviction. I believe that people who want to have a family using assisted reproductive technology are not criminals. I do not believe it is the role of governments to judge who should or should not be a parent. I believe children should be allowed to live free of discrimination and prejudice and be proud, regardless of the structure of their family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038326"></A>
This is a serious issue and, as I said, it is long overdue to be addressed. I personally paid the price for the illegality that exists today. I am very proud to be part of correcting that injustice. I congratulate the select committee for doing a great job. I congratulate the Attorney-General and his staff and I am proud to be part of a Labor government that has finally legalised altruistic surrogacy for this state for all who wish to have a family. I support the Labor bill, I reject the opposition bill and I commend our bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (4.12 pm), in reply: Rhetorically, members opposite ask us: what right does the state have to intrude in the decisions that people make in their daily personal lives? Such an assertion manifestly fails to understand the role that we have as people elected to reflect the views and the desires of the community. It also degrades the diversity of views--personal views indeed--of members of this place which have been shaped, guided and cemented by their individual experiences, learnings and innate personal values. The member for Gladstone said it succinctly when she pointed out that you can love and respect someone without agreeing with them or supporting what they do or what they seek to achieve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038329"></A>
Every single day that this parliament sits, it makes laws that intrude into every facet of a person’s life. It places obligations and burdens on individuals to comply with a direction, report matters and not do certain things. Similarly, it does this for groups, businesses or even its own agencies. Our decisions have never been limited to a clinical separation of what is personal and therefore totally unregulated and that which is extraneous and materially detached and therefore free to be highly regulated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038330"></A>
It is also true that there is questionable consistency in the arguments and approaches that political parties advocate and indeed its members vote on from time to time. The member for Gympie pointed out the differences in the age of consent, which is claimed to discriminate against homosexuals. What about gay marriage or civil union, which even Labor’s own Kevin Rudd opposes? If Labor stood on a true antidiscrimination platform, it would move to change these things which are obviously discriminating, using its express criteria. </Hansard-Body>

Last night, the Deputy Premier made an intelligent and indeed erudite contribution outlining his motivations in supporting the government’s bill, including same-sex and single surrogacy arrangements and indeed his opposition to the LNP’s alternative. Few people who listened to that contribution could argue against the Deputy Premier’s heartfelt and passionate approach and personal logic, even though we might, as I do, disagree with his stand. To paraphrase him, he told us that the things we believe are earth-shattering and spectacular one day raise little more than patronising disbelief further down the track. Even in this case, his moral and ethical compass has not always pointed in the same direction, and I realise that people can make the same charge against me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038332"></A>
I remember that a little over two years ago the Deputy Premier and I sat on the same side of the House opposing a bill to allow for the creation of embryos for scientific experimentation. I have little doubt that our genuine and our heartfelt reasons for opposing that bill--even though for somewhat different reasons--will be looked on with quaint derision by our successors and historians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038333"></A>
There are many things that have stood the test of time and deeply reflect the social conscience of society. Most important amongst them is the notion of family. For me, that constitutes a family where we start life as a result of a relationship between a man and a woman and mostly being born into the environment consisting of those two people which were and are unique to us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038334"></A>
Individual members will approach this debate from different angles. Some will be faith based, some will be social reformers, some will come from the angle of nature’s way, and indeed others will come from the basis of their own personal views and values. I have approached this from the last two categories--personal values and nature’s way. If indeed it can be argued that same-sex attraction is in most part a natural thing--and I believe that there is significant evidence across the human and animal world to attest to that fact--then you must also logically conclude that children or offspring are not a natural consequence of a same-sex relationship, or even of an individual in isolation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038335"></A>
I make no apology for holding those deep personal views as they are mine, but they are not mine alone. Indeed, they are shared by many people across the political and social spectrum. Children arise from a relationship between a man and a woman. That is how nature intended it, by accident or design or some other way. For me, that absolutely underpins the importance of a child starting life with a mum and a dad. Few people can be directly responsible for what might happen after that. I can report to the House that 86 per cent of Australians asked in November last year said that they ideally believed that children should start life with a mum and a dad. To me, that says a lot. Despite that, those opposite advocate for same-sex or single parenting, but the majority of Australians still believe that children deserve a mum and a dad. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038336"></A>
At no stage, publicly or privately, have I ever said that singles or same-sex people do not love those in their care. I have always maintained that, notwithstanding that fact, there is a preferable world for a child to be brought up in--that is, with a mum and a dad. Many sociologists and experts agree, and those studies have been quoted ad nauseam in this debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038337"></A>
The Minister for Child Safety absolutely agrees. Last year, in debate on amendments to the Adoption Act he said that it is not in the best interests of a child to be brought up in a same-sex family. Indeed, on that basis, he and the parliament disqualified same-sex couples and singles from adopting children and even suspended the Anti-Discrimination Act to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038366"></A>
The LNP is being absolutely consistent in its approach by imposing the same ban in our Family (Surrogacy) Bill. We are still waiting for the minister to explain why it is not in the best interests of the child to be raised in a same-sex or single-parent adoptive family. The most disappointing thing about the minister’s inconsistency is that yesterday he tried to blame it on the requirements of overseas countries which supply children for adoption when that was never the original reason for the Labor Party’s objection in the original ban, which was, and should always be, about the best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038369"></A>
The member for Whitsunday told the parliament that she opposed the LNP’s bill because it did not pass the anti-discrimination test. She did not tell us why she supported the government’s adoption bill, which similarly did not pass the anti-discrimination test, when it moved to actively discriminate against same-sex couples and singles in the best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038372"></A>
The LNP’s bill proposes that non-commercial surrogacy be available for heterosexual, married and de facto couples and excludes singles and same-sex couples. The government’s bill opens it up to virtually any person over the age of 25. Because same-sex males and singles are unable to naturally conceive and there is no medical reason for disqualification, they virtually automatically qualify for a surrogacy arrangement on social grounds alone. An eligible woman, however, must withstand a far more intrusive legislative test and demonstrate in the most comprehensive way why she should be considered on medical grounds, notwithstanding the fact that for many of these women there has been extreme pain and tragedy as they have previously tried to have a family. This, to me, is the crux of the failing of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038373"></A>
When non-commercial surrogacy was proposed, it was to be on the basis of last resort and medical need. There was no mention of social need. Now it is legislated that, arguably, medical need is subordinate to social need and it is no longer a last resort. Prior to the establishment of the committee, the need to relax the laws on non-commercial surrogacy was always framed around the compassionate requirements of couples and their agony in not being able to conceive or have a child. Whilst I do not comment on all, or even most, of the contributions in the debate, there are observations that I will make in response to some of the speeches. I do, however, thank members for their comments on the Family (Surrogacy) Bill, even though they may not have been supportive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038374"></A>
To members who support the bill, I say thank you. To members who do not, I acknowledge their reason for doing so. Many members opposite have asserted that children do not choose the circumstances of their birth. This is true, but it is also true that this government plans to not only actively construct the circumstances of the birth of many children but also how they live their lives. From a social engineering context, this bill not only takes many Queenslanders beyond their discomfort zone on surrogacy but also takes them to the much more personally uncomfortable zone of same-sex and single-parent surrogacy. Fundamentally, government members have been completely unable to grasp that reality. That is why many, if not most, Queenslanders oppose the government’s plan. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Archbishop’s views are certainly not in the minority amongst faith communities or, indeed, Queenslanders. Arguably, I believe they are amongst the current majority. Yesterday in this place the member for Currumbin and the member for Burdekin, in particular, completely tore apart the fabrication of those opposite that there was complete bipartisan support for a move towards the decriminalisation of not only surrogacy in Queensland but also a recommendation for same-sex and single-parent surrogacy to be a part of non-commercial surrogacy arrangements. That is not the case and has never been the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038391"></A>
People may wish to have their own personal views on this. That is a matter for them. I do not support the government’s bill. I confess today that I personally have an element of difficulty with non-commercial surrogacy in general, even when it comes to opposite sex de factos and married couples, because I think that there are difficulties. When you have to remove a child from their birth mother, there are complications that go with regard to that surrogacy arrangement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038392"></A>
I listened to the member for Hervey Bay earlier today when he said that we really do not know the consequences of, or the fallout from, this further down the track. However, as I understand it, those people who provided evidence to the committee who were a consequence of a surrogacy arrangement seem to be well balanced and attuned. I am not sure how many there were, but certainly that was the indication I received. However, having said that, my understanding is that those people were generally the result of a relationship where there was a direct genetic connection. It was also clearly a situation where that child grew up with a mother and a father. We are going to watch this and monitor this over the next few years, as we should, to see where this legislation’s consequence ultimately takes us.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038394"></A>
Yesterday I sat in this place and I listened to the extraordinary contribution from the member for Chatsworth, who talked about a particular function that was held here last year of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer community. He basically indicated that there was some sort of duplicity on the part of LNP members by our attendance. The LNP did not go along to provide anyone with false hope. The LNP never gave people an indication that we would be doing anything other than what we are doing today. Our stance on this issue was already a matter for the public record. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038395"></A>
Indeed, during the barbecue I had more than one discussion with people who talked about this issue. It might surprise members opposite to hear that not every member of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer community supports the proposal that this government is making here today. I think it is absolutely patronising and it takes a quantum leap of faith for the government to say that this is a mainstream issue for that particular community that I have explained today. It is also absolutely offensive that those people opposite should attest that they have the support and the best interests in mind of that particular community and that only they have friends on that side.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041603"></A>
I must admit that I am always very reticent to come into this place and talk about who my friends are because it can sound cliché and trite, but anyone who knows me knows that my closest friends are from that community. I can tell those opposite that they do not support this legislation either. </Hansard-Body>

 Extract from the Queensland Gay and Lesbian News, titled ‘Your Leaders’ Views on GLBTIQ Issues’ [<HypertextLink>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041608"></A>
There it is. We outlined our position on the issues we were asked about. The member for Brisbane Central was the only Labor member who actually responded. As this publication says, notwithstanding the best efforts of their editorial team and their journalists who tried to call in absolutely every favour and every connection they had, they were unable to get the Premier to respond to their demands for answers on particular issues. That is the commitment of the Labor Party to gay, lesbian, transgender, intersex, bisexual and queer issues. It uses them as an object of convenience with absolute inconsistency. In this article I honestly answered every question that was put forward to me. Guess what? The issue of gay surrogacy was not raised as one of their issues of concern. This is a publication that speaks for and asks questions on behalf of that community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041609"></A>
I am not saying that there are not sections of that community that have a view and want this particular legislation. Let no-one come in here and say that that is the view of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and other sections of that community. It is not their mainstream demand. I will point out their mainstream demand. I was able to satisfy them in terms of some of their demands and disappointed them in terms of their other demands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041610"></A>
I will deal with the questions that they specifically asked. They covered adoption. Has the government let them down on adoption? Of course the government has let them down on adoption. We said we did not support adoption for this community, nor indeed for singles. In terms of age of consent, we said that we had no plans to change it. We addressed pink tourism and suicide prevention in respect of children and adults. They also asked for an increase in HIV funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041611"></A>
We heard those members opposite say that we do not have a positive record of initiatives with this particular community. Indeed it was Russell Cooper and the coalition government of 1996 to 1998 that brought in the gay and lesbian liaison officers within the Police Service in Queensland to ensure we could work with that community and crack down on the appalling violence that was being perpetrated against that community. It was not the members of the Labor Party who did that. Who funded the AIDS Council in Queensland? It was a National Party government. Who defunded the AIDS Council in Queensland? It was a Labor government. Let us not forget that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041613"></A>
The Labor government speaks with forked tongue when it comes to those issues which are of mainstream concern to that particular community. When it comes to the issue of pink tourism, we understand that this is a significant area of tourism. This group would have benefited overall from the announced increase in tourism and suicide prevention funding which we put forward at the last election. Suicide prevention is a very important issue for gay and lesbian people, particularly young gay and lesbian people, as it is amongst the broader community of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041615"></A>
Whilst that community might not necessarily support our stand, at least we were upfront about where we stand. We do not go around giving false hope to this community--patronising paternalism on the one hand and then turning around and saying, ‘We cannot get the Premier to get back to you.’ The influence of the member for Brisbane Central was that she could not even get the Premier to respond to their mainstream gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
and queer news. She was not able to get the Premier, her own leader, to do that. That speaks volumes for what the Labor Party thinks about mainstream gay issues in Queensland. Let no-one forget that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041617"></A>
I will always be upfront. My values are known. I have always said that. I am not going to beat around the bush and pretend I am something when I am actually something else as we have seen members of the Labor Party do here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041618"></A>
We have had disgraceful slurs on members of the gay community and comments about how those people who actually work for us who may be from the gay community could support our position. I can tell honourable members: do not assume that the majority of gay people out there actually support this as their main issue of concern. Honourable members opposite know that for a fact. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041619"></A>
I want to comment on a couple of other issues that were raised here. We heard the Treasurer come in here earlier today and assert a whole range of things about members opposite. He talked about corrupted morality. All we had was a great big slagathon. All we had was a great big slurathon from this Treasurer who is incapable of comprehensively putting forward an argument based on his own morals and why he may or may not support legislation before this parliament. I am saying why I support it. He did not say anything. All he did was come in here and lay the slipper into other people. Those opposite dare to stand up and talk about a level of intolerance and assert a level of intolerance on this side of the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041620"></A>
Imagine what would have happened both in here and also in the media if a member on this side stood up and tried to suggest that those opposite used some sort of Nazi approach or some sort of extreme Fascist approach. That is what the member did when he tried to bring in the Nazi equivalent. I thought that was quite appalling. Imagine how that would have been perceived if we had sought to do that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041621"></A>
The bills before the parliament are basically the same with a couple of exceptions--that is, the government’s bill seeks to legalise altruistic surrogacy in Queensland and it also seeks to extend it to same-sex and single-sex couples. The LNP’s proposal is that we would also legalise non-commercial surrogacy but it would be restricted to heterosexual couples. That is on the record. That is where the conscience of this parliament will lie. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041622"></A>
I will be seeking to move amendments later on. I will speak about those when I move them. By and large, our bill is much the same as the government’s other than those significant ideological and philosophical divergences. We would have no problem in supporting aspects of the government’s bill if it had not been contaminated by mixing in these particular issues. We would have had no problem whatsoever with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041624"></A>
I suppose, until the complication yesterday, it was probably envisaged that there would have been separate votes--maybe there still could have been--on these bills. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well, it was his advice. We have respect for the advice of the Speaker. We have the chance in the consideration in detail stage to move an amendment which addresses our fundamental issues.

We have debated that here. </Hansard-Body>

Obviously, I encourage all members to support the proposition that I will put forward. I know that this is a very difficult social issue for parliamentarians and therefore it needs to be considered as such. It is wrong to say that those on the other side speak specifically for that section of the community. I do not believe that they do. I do not believe the facts attest to that either.

 Even the member for Rockhampton in the sunset of his career--and that is becoming more obvious by his rantings at question time each day--can easily understand where people actually stand with regard to these particular views. It was the government that came in here, that sought to actually debate this bill in a cognate debate. Indeed, it was the government that actually brought its bill in after the opposition introduced its bill. The individual views of members of this parliament are well known. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If he wants to talk about honesty, that is honesty. We told that particular gay and lesbian community where we stood. We told them where we stood all the way through. Where is the Premier? A big fat cross--no-one could find the Premier despite the best efforts of all the contacts and the incumbent Labor member for Brisbane Central, where I am sure that many of these people actually reside. I think that says a whole lot about honesty, about paternalism and about what they say, what they mean and actually sticking to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044656"></A>
As I indicated, I am going to table that article. Certainly we will be watching this bill with a great degree of interest. We will see where this act ultimately concludes and the consequences, both positive and negative, further down the track. I think this parliament needs to monitor that because we have a social obligation to do so. That is what we will be doing. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (4.41 pm), in reply: At the outset I would like to thank all honourable members for their contributions to this cognate debate on the Surrogacy Bill and the Family (Surrogacy) Bill 2009. I acknowledge that there are different views on the issues raised in the bill. I want to thank almost all honourable members for giving the bill the serious consideration it deserves. I particularly want to acknowledge the contributions made by the members for Albert and Capalaba. These are members who spoke from their conscience. They spoke with courage and conviction. Nothing could be more exemplary of the role of parliamentarians, particularly in a conscience vote in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection. It is disappointing that no-one on the opposition benches could find it in their hearts to look through the discrimination that Queensland children face and support the government’s position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044662"></A>
I also want to acknowledge the comments made by the member for Toowoomba North in relation to counselling for children who may be born through surrogacy arrangements. That is a matter I will place under consideration, and, for various reasons that I will expand on later, it is not a matter that I do not necessarily think we need to proceed with at this time. As I say, it will be a matter that I will give consideration to. </Hansard-Body>

This bill has taken many members on a journey, and I have gone on my own personal journey in relation to this bill coming before the parliament. I am someone who could not have asked for more love and support from their parents, but I do recognise there are other forms of families in society. I have a mother and father who love me dearly and I love them in return, but I do not believe that Queensland children should be treated differentially because of the circumstances of their birth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044664"></A>
I do want to thank Archbishop John Bathersby as well, who convened a meeting of the heads of churches, a meeting that I attended last week. At that meeting were heads of all the major denominations in Queensland. It was a very cordial, open, honest and friendly discussion. I want to put on record my thanks to him, my thanks to Archbishop Phillip Aspinall, the Anglican Archbishop of Australia, the Primate of Australia, and all other heads of churches who attended that open and frank discussion.</Hansard-Body>

At the outset it is important to outline the comprehensive consultation process that has culminated in this debate today. It has been extraordinary in the debate for individuals to claim, as the opposition has, that somehow this bill has been sneaked into the parliament or rushed through. No piece of legislation could have been subject to greater public examination than the government’s Surrogacy Bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044668"></A>
On 8 October 2008, the Queensland parliamentary Investigation into Altruistic Surrogacy Committee, otherwise known as the ‘parliamentary committee’, tabled a report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Investigation into the decriminalisation and regulation of altruistic surrogacy in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. This parliamentary all-party committee with members of the government and the opposition and Independents took evidence from the public. A public inquiry was conducted into this matter and a report tabled in the parliament. On 23 April 2009, the tabled government response to the report committed the government to releasing a legislative model for the decriminalisation of altruistic surrogacy and the transfer of parentage of the child. On 18 August 2009, the Premier and I released for comment the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland government model for the decriminalisation of altruistic surrogacy and the transfer of legal parentage</Hansard-Italic>
, otherwise known as the ‘Queensland model’. On the same day the Premier and I also released for comment a review on the legal status of children being cared for by same-sex parents. On 28 October 2009, the government tabled an exposure draft of the Surrogacy Bill 2009 for public consultation. On 26 November 2009 the government bill was introduced and has lain on the table of the House until yesterday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044671"></A>
At every step of the consultation process there has been strong public support for the government’s approach. There is no more a government can do than put the government’s position to the community and ask for a response. There is no more the government can do than that and solicit the views of the Queensland community. Consistently, there has been strong public support for the government’s approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044672"></A>
It is important that we go back to the basic recommendations in the parliamentary committee’s report. These recommendations included, primarily, that altruistic surrogacy is to be decriminalised with an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework. The parliamentary committee’s report does not place any limits or restrictions on whom the decriminalisation should apply to. There is no recommendation from the committee that places fetters on it. It had the opportunity to so resolve; it did not do so. The government’s bill, similarly, does not place any limits on decriminalisation. To do otherwise is discriminatory not only against the adults who may be excluded from the decriminalisation regime but, more significantly and importantly, against their children, who will not receive any of the legal benefits of the regulatory framework. It is for these reasons that the government’s bill does not contain any discriminatory exclusions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044673"></A>
It is not enough to just decriminalise altruistic surrogacy. As the parliamentary committee reported, there needs to be a regulatory framework complementing the decriminalisation. This regulatory framework as contained in the government bill allows an application to be made to a Children’s Court judge for an order for transfer of parentage. The order for transfer of parentage can only be made upon the satisfaction of strict requirements including counselling, independent legal advice, age requirements, consent, an independent report to the court and, ultimately, that the order is for the child’s wellbeing and is in the best interests of the child. The order for transfer of parentage procedure means that the legal status of the child reflects the social reality of the surrogacy, namely, that the intended parents under the arrangement are the child’s parents. This also means that these children’s legal status in all matters ranging from the day-to-day giving of consent for school excursions to the intricacies of inheritance law entitlements are the same as they are for all other Queensland children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044674"></A>
I also want to refer briefly to the amendments to the parentage presumptions under the Status of Children Act arising from the use of the fertilisation procedures with the consent of the birth mother’s female partner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044676"></A>
The government believes it is time to act to ensure that children born in these relationships are no longer disadvantaged in relation to support in the event of separation or in relation to inheritance, superannuation or compensation in the event of injury or death of the non-birth parent. Simply changing the laws relating to these specific areas, for example succession law, would be unsatisfactory and in the end insufficient. It results in a group of children who are treated differently from other children who have lost a parent, where this group of children are forced to prove the circumstances of their birth, possibly many years after the event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048429"></A>
I turn now to the progress of the debate upon these bills and to address the issues raised by members. We have gathered in this House this week to debate an issue of real and substantial importance, a matter that deserves careful and considered discourse. We carry with us the innate trust of the people of our state that in debating these matters we will rise above base political instincts and take in a view that not only travels from one geographic end of the state to the other, but also adopts a view across history, both that which has been made, and forward, to understand that what we do is history in itself. The daily test of entry to this chamber is that we must apply ourselves to problems great and small, fearlessly and honestly with all the intellectual rigour we can muster.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048436"></A>
I remind members of this, because there have been comments and arguments raised in the debate, particularly by those members opposite, that seek to distort and misrepresent the very purpose behind the government’s bill. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether to decriminalise arrangements that individuals agree between themselves to start a family where no other option is available to them. The government has sought to remove itself from the space of regulating how children are brought into the world and focus instead upon ensuring that those children are protected as they grow up, without passing judgements on what families should or should not look like to an outsider and without condemning those children to possess a lesser class of rights than other Queensland children. However, many in the opposition remain straitjacketed by their desire to control the family unit, to attempt to deter would-be families from forming through the threat of criminal sanction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044722"></A>
As the member for Southern Downs noted in his opening comments, the opposition’s bill is ‘almost identical’ to the bill proposed by the government. That is true. The area of argument is very limited indeed. The opposition supports altruistic surrogacy. It has no issue with a surrogate mother giving up her child to another person. The bill it supports provides for surrogate arrangements to be legal and that the conditions of such arrangements would be identical to what the government introduced. But why then has the opposition claimed continuously and at great length that it is the guardian of the interests of the child? Given the many similarities, where do the interests of the child lie in this debate? Let me set out the two cases placed before this House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044723"></A>
The opposition claims that the child’s best interest is met by criminalising surrogate arrangements that it does not approve of. It claims that that will prevent children having parents who are single or who are of the same sex, or who have been in a de facto relationship for less than two years. The opposition claims that if a child did have parents who were single, or who were of the same sex, or who were in a de facto relationship so described, then the child would be disadvantaged and thus the opposition threatens these parents whom they regard as unworthy with prison. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044724"></A>
Where does the government say the child’s interest lies? In being treated the same in law as all other Queensland children. In having the same status at law as all other Queensland children. In not criminalising parents who want to love children and in not threatening consenting adult Queenslanders with imprisonment for entering into altruistic surrogacy arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044725"></A>
The Liberal National Party, from the leader to the far reaches of its discontented backbenchers, contends that criminal sanction is the best and most appropriate remedy to prevent single people, or same-sex or de facto couples, from having children through altruistic surrogacy arrangements. This is an inappropriate use of the criminal law in our state. What the LNP does not like, it marginalises, excludes and criminalises. That is the only inescapable conclusion of the opposition’s bill before the parliament: one rule for some, jail for the rest. This is a return to the dark days of the stigma of illegitimacy, of branding a child with the invisible mark of Cain that singles them out as ‘other’. The core of this debate does indeed rest upon what is in the best interests of children of loving parents. Should they be treated equally or should some children be branded as something less than usual or normal, their rights diminished and inferior to others? The opposition proposes a bill that expressly and inexorably marginalises not only classes of parents that it does not like but, importantly and more significantly in this debate, it will marginalise the children of these families. It deliberately seeks to place the rights of those children a distant second to the rights of other Queensland children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044726"></A>
We must set aside whatever views the LNP harbours towards families that do not fit its formula, whether by accident or by choice, and consider the impact of the opposition’s bill upon the children of these families. These children do not disappear if this bill passes. They will not cease to be brought into being, as they have for many years pursuant to surrogacy arrangements. Their parents will not love them less, but they will be labelled as something less than other children--their rights inferior to the rights of other Queensland children. The law, where it grants freedoms, should not grant these freedoms to one class of persons and deny them to others. If altruistic surrogacy is decriminalised, it should be decriminalised for all citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044727"></A>
The member for Southern Downs and others who spoke in this debate have fundamentally misunderstood, and I believe in many respects misrepresented, what lies at the heart of the government’s Surrogacy Bill. The government’s bill is about ensuring that all Queensland children are treated equally. It is not a bill that denies children their rights. It is not a bill that constructs families. It is not a bill that forces surrogacy upon society. This is a bill that removes an outdated and ineffective criminal sanction and does so to ensure that the legal rights and status of Queensland children born through altruistic surrogacy are the same as those of all other Queensland children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044728"></A>
The member for Southern Downs and many on that side of the House who have followed him in this debate have claimed that ‘kids do better with a mum and dad’, but more than that, they have then gone on to claim that anything other than that situation is somehow inadequate. These members have claimed that children of such other families should be disadvantaged simply by virtue of who their parents are. The member for Southern Downs and others on that side of the House have come to this place to say that families who do not fit their mould are not caring families, that the children will be somehow let down, that the children will be denied their rights. They seek to form families in their own collective image and to punish by criminal sanction those who do not fit that image. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044729"></A>
Governments and parliaments should not involve themselves in the picking and choosing of who can have children and who cannot. History shows that political leaders are ill suited to such tasks, as the tragic history of the 20th century well demonstrates. It is not for us, as members of parliament, to arbitrarily draw lines according to our own personal opinions or views to divide the worthy from the unworthy. What role should parliaments have in these matters? What right do parliamentarians have to direct and control the private arrangements of adults and, in doing so, whether honourable members like it or not, marginalise children born from such arrangements? I conclude that they have no such role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044730"></A>
To the contrary, the government believes that children should be raised by parents--any parents--who can best love them and best provide for them and best give to them all the opportunities that life may present. The quality and capacity of a parent should be judged by their actions, not by their name, their gender, their race, their marital status, nor their sexual orientation. The bipartisan committee specifically addressed this issue, noting at page 78--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044732"></A>
... the committee believes concerns for the outcomes for children of same-sex parents are not supported by the available research. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044733"></A>
The report of the all-party parliamentary committee states further at page 39--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044735"></A>
A review of research outcomes for children born of same-sex couples also indicated children were not disadvantaged by their family type. Outcomes were dependent on the quality of family relationships and the quality of nurturing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044736"></A>
But for the LNP, that is no longer good enough. And why? What evidence has the LNP presented? What clear, rational rebuttal to the committee’s findings has it formulated? Because single or same-sex parents, according to the member for Condamine, get confused about public toilets. The member for Condamine’s contribution--a man who purports to be an alternative minister of the state--speaks for itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044737"></A>
In his contribution to the debate the member for Southern Downs said that the government’s bill is--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044739"></A>
... contaminated with elements that are philosophically against what we on this side support. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044740"></A>
I thought long and hard. I listened to every speech. It is my great privilege to sit in this House during debates on these great matters of state and listen to every word that is said by every politician in this House--and, Mr Speaker, a privilege that you also have. I thought, ‘What is the philosophical foundation for what the members opposite are doing?’ In thinking about this, I had cause to remember a speech that was given by Senator George Brandis, a Liberal senator for Queensland--or is it LNP senator for Queensland; I am not sure--late last year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044743"></A>
On 22 October 2009, Senator Brandis gave the 2009 Alfred Deakin Lecture at the University of Melbourne. In that speech Senator Brandis, in a very, very clear and detailed way, set out a very clear and detailed exposition of the history of liberalism broadly and also liberalism in Australia. I am not often wont to quote from Senator Brandis, but it is worth reflecting on what he said about liberalism in his thoughtful and measured speech. This is what Senator Brandis said about Alfred Deakin, the father of Australian liberalism and a former Australian Prime Minister and a former Australian Attorney-General--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044745"></A>
... Deakin had no difficulty with the notion that the business of the Liberal Party is the advancement of liberalism, and that the central task of liberalism, from which all else follows and upon which all else depends, is to maximize the freedom of the individual. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044746"></A>
The senator went on to state--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044748"></A>
I am at pains to make this point--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044749"></A>
about why the Liberal Party adopted the name ‘Liberal’ and why traditional liberal values were so important--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044751"></A>
because, over the past twenty years or so, there has been an attempt to dilute the Liberal Party’s commitment to liberalism. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044752"></A>
We know all about that in Queensland. The senator went on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044754"></A>
And so we come back to the essential flaw of conservatism--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044755"></A>
the duality between liberalism and conservatism, and this is what he said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044757"></A>
... its ethical relativism. A conservative, no less than a liberal, is horrified by the thought that human beings might be crushed in the name of an abstraction, yet we often find him indifferent, or even an apologist, when human beings are actually being crushed by an existing political system--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044758"></A>
or in this case--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044760"></A>
a social order. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044796"></A>
The senator goes on to talk about the achievements of liberals: the extension of the suffrage in the great Reform Act in 1832, liberals who championed the emancipation of Roman Catholics in 1834, liberals under the banner of Wilberforce who abolished the slave trade. The senator says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044801"></A>
In every case, they did so in the face of conservative opposition.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044802"></A>
He goes on to talk about how liberals in America passed the Civil Rights Act and challenged the apartheid regime in South Africa. In almost all of those challenges the party that I represent, organised Labor, stood for those reforms. The senator goes on--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044804"></A>
It was liberals who advanced the rights of women, while conservatives resisted; liberals ... who championed--and who continue to champion--the interests of ethnic minorities, while conservatives resisted; liberals who argued for an end to discrimination against people because of their sexuality, while conservatives resisted. Every one of those reforms extended the bounds of human freedom, gave individual men and women greater autonomy, wider choice, more respect for their dignity. Every one of them was a liberal victory which conservatives opposed at the time, but--at least in most cases--today defend. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044805"></A>
The senator went on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044807"></A>
It is for liberals to provide that ‘strong barrier of moral conviction’; to stand between the individual and society and to assert the rights of the individual whenever the pressures, demands or prejudices of the social mainstream would diminish them. That is liberalism’s historic role, and it is that conviction which has animated every liberal reform which has extended the boundaries of human freedom. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044808"></A>
In conclusion, Senator Brandis quoted from Sir Robert Menzies. Many opposite hold up Sir Robert Menzies as their idol. The young fogies, as I call them, the new young members of parliament such as the member for Kawana, idolise Sir Robert Menzies. At the end of his speech Senator Brandis said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044810"></A>
Menzies said it best in five simple words: ‘We have stood for freedom.’ That is our legacy. That is our purpose as a political movement. That, as Malcolm Turnbull put it, is the golden thread of our history. And that is the path to our future. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044811"></A>
What we have seen in this debate is the termination of that path in Queensland. We have seen the death of liberalism in our state when the dead hand of conservatism, the dead hand of the Country Party, has put to rest any sense of traditional liberalism that former members of the Liberal Party once had. It is a sham. It is a false pretence for the opposition to call themselves the Liberal National Party. Do members remember the catchcry at the last election about progressive conservatism? We have seen the death of any progressive approach from the members opposite. Where were the Liberals and the former leaders of the Liberals in this debate? Where was the member for Moggill? Where was the member for Indooroopilly? Where were all of those members who once stood up for liberal values? Cowed and quiet. They do not have the courage of liberal convictions and they have left the running of this debate to the old, dead, withered hand of the Country Party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044812"></A>
As Manning Clark said, there are two groups in Australian society: the straighteners, those who seek to straighten people to put them into a particular class, and the enlargers, those who seek to enlarge and grow the Australian society. I know where the Australian Labor Party stands. As Lawson said, ‘the old dead stick and the young tree green’. I know who the old dead stick is in this chamber and I know who stands for liberal values. If those opposite are willing to abandon them, we are willing to stand up for individual liberty, freedom and choice. That should be what those opposite stand for. How is that demonstrated? Through a conscience vote that the Australian Labor Party took seriously and one that we took to heart. It was not a collective conscience such as from the members opposite. How is that demonstrated? The perfect example of that was the email circulated by the member for Cleveland on 9 February and put to this House by the member for Keppel. Did the member for Cleveland deny it? No, he did not. In his email he shows no respect for authority, no respect for the position of Premier and no respect for the political leader of our state. In his grubby email he states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044813"></A>
Bligh will force her bill through today/tomorrow without offering a conscience vote. It is incredible that this is not a conscience vote. Bligh obviously does not trust her own MPs to support her social experiment so will force it upon us today. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044814"></A>
In this House on 18 August the Premier said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044815"></A>
This issue in the Labor Party will be the subject of a conscience vote. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044816"></A>
Honourable members opposite lecture us about moral standards and how we and others should behave in society. They rely on biblical sayings and terms. I refer the member for Cleveland to Exodus 20:16--thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044817"></A>
There was much in this debate about one survey, propagated by the opposition, that 86 per cent of Queenslanders believe that children should be raised by their biological parents. I am yet to see the amendment come in to this House that says children born of in-vitro fertilisation or alternative reproductive therapy should be brought up by their biological parents. We wait for that amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044818"></A>
What are some of the other statistics the members opposite do not quote? The Galaxy Research Poll of December 2008 said that there is strong support amongst Queenslanders that children in same-sex families should have both parents recognised by Queensland law, with two in three, 67 per cent, agreeing that both parents should be recognised by law. Conversely, 26 per cent disagree. I know where I stand: with the two-thirds of Queenslanders who support this legislative reform. Furthermore, the Galaxy Research Poll of June 2009 reported that a strong majority, 85 per cent, of Australians support federal laws protecting Australians from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. In comparison, just 10 per cent oppose such laws. The members opposite want to stand with the 26 per cent who oppose recognising same-sex couples and want to stand with the 10 per cent who want to have a discriminatory law in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044819"></A>
This has been an enlightening debate in many respects. It has been a debate that, as I said earlier, has taken me on my own personal journey. In conclusion, we need to ensure that the children of surrogacy arrangements, those that have occurred and will continue to occur whether we change the law or not, are protected in Queensland society. We need to ensure that children are treated the same regardless of their birth parents. That is important for this parliament. That is something that this parliament must do. We must not support the discriminatory approach proposed by those opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044820"></A>
The bottom line in the cognate debate is that the government’s bill raises three fundamental points: firstly, that altruistic surrogacy should be decriminalised; secondly, that children born as a result of an altruistic surrogacy arrangement deserve to be treated at law the same as all other Queensland children and should not be disadvantaged because of who their parents are; and, thirdly, that surrogacy arrangements are matters for adult Queenslanders to determine themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044821"></A>
The member for Southern Downs on behalf of the opposition disagrees and argues: firstly, that altruistic surrogacy should remain a crime for some groups in the community; secondly, that the state should determine who can have children through surrogacy arrangements and who cannot and jail people they do not approve of; and, thirdly, that children born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement that the members opposite do not like should be second-class citizens and their parents labelled second-class carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044822"></A>
The choice in this debate could not be more stark. I said at the outset that there are different views on the issues raised in this bill. At the end of the day, however, this bill is not about those views. This bill is about ensuring the best interests of all Queensland children and enshrining that in law. It is about ensuring that the legal status of all children is the same no matter what the circumstances of their birth or parentage. I commend the government’s bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Honourable members, the question before the House is that the Family (Surrogacy) Bill be now read a second time. But I draw members’ attention to my statement circulated on 10 February 2010 regarding the application of the same question rule contained in standing order 87. Standing order 87 provides that ‘a question or amendment shall not be proposed which is the same as any question which, during the same session, has been resolved in the affirmative or negative’. The Family (Surrogacy) Bill seeks to achieve substantially the same objective as that contained in the Surrogacy Bill, which the House has just resolved to read a second time. Therefore, under standing order 87, the Family (Surrogacy) Bill cannot proceed and is therefore discharged from the <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1044871"></A>
This amendment seeks to rename the act the ‘Family (Surrogacy) Act’. I will be moving amendments during consideration in detail, most of them en bloc, which basically reflect the aspirations that I outlined during my contribution yesterday and also my summary today. While the government’s bill and the opposition’s bill were very similar in many ways, they divert in one significant way--and that is that we believe that, while non-commercial surrogacy should be available in Queensland, it should be restricted to heterosexual de facto and married couples. Therefore, if we are successful with these particular amendments, it stands to reason that the act should be renamed the ‘Family (Surrogacy) Act’. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The amendment is really narrow in compass. The government opposes it. The government prefers the title ‘Surrogacy Act’. When the public are looking for the legislation, the first thing they will look for is ‘surrogacy’. They are more likely to look for that than ‘family surrogacy’. Accordingly, the government opposes the amendment. </Hansard-Body>

This amendment relates to the time at which this particular act would come into being. The reason we have selected 1 April this year is that it actually dovetails in and comes into being after the start of the Adoption Act in Queensland. We did that because there are some complementary and crossover provisions with regard to the Surrogacy Act that we would propose and that do exist. Therefore, we think it is far more important that we have the start time as 1 April to complement the Adoption Act.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.30 pm): I listened intently to the Attorney-General’s speech. While he spoke about Henry Lawson, George Brandis and Alfred Deakin during his summation, he failed to mention the people I was most concerned about--that is, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, especially the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children whom I spoke about in my speech. I ask the Attorney to answer this question: does the legislation have any guiding principles that will protect the cultural identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048872"></A>
As the Attorney-General might remember, I talked about the example of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander birth mother who had her baby taken away from her. What rights does a baby like that have to know about its Aboriginality or its Torres Strait Islander culture if it is given across to the intended parents? Can the Attorney-General also tell me whether this legislation has any guiding principles for the best interests of the child which require health and criminal history checks of the intended parents or parent? For example, if a parent or parents had a reportable or communicable disease such as HIV, would that disqualify that person or persons from being an intended parent? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048894"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In respect of the first part of the question, surrogacy arrangements will, at their heart, be a consensual relationship entered into by all parties--a surrogate mother and the intending parents. All parents will go in with their eyes open. That has occurred anyway in Queensland, regardless of what the current legislation states, and it will occur in the future. If parents wish to get a parentage order, they will then make an application to the court. The court will determine whether a whole range of things have been satisfied--the safeguards set out in the bill--and also whether ultimately the parentage order is for the wellbeing and in the best interests of the child. Of course, the birth mother is not required to relinquish the child. There is no forced relinquishment. I do not think, as some honourable members do, or might, that Indigenous Queenslanders are any less capable of entering into a consensual relationship with other Queenslanders if they wish to be part of a surrogacy arrangement. As the Deputy Premier said in his speech, these sorts of arrangements have been common, particularly in Torres Strait Islander communities and, from my own experience, Pacific island communities for many centuries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048896"></A>
I do want to put one thing on the record and it concerns the frequency of these relationships. Surrogacy arrangements will be ones that people will have to think about very carefully indeed. Can I explain to the House and put on the record what has been the experience in other jurisdictions where surrogacy has been regulated? In Western Australia, the surrogacy legislation has been in operation for almost one year. To date its independent panel to approve surrogacy arrangements, the Western Australian Reproductive Technology Council, has not received any applications for the approval of a surrogacy arrangement. Victoria’s surrogacy legislation commenced on 1 December 2009, and to date there have not been any applications made for the approval of a surrogacy arrangement to the Victorian independent panel, the Patient Review Panel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048899"></A>
In the Australian Capital Territory, there have been approximately five applications made to the Supreme Court for a parentage order since the surrogacy reforms were made in 2004--less than one a year. The amendments to the law in Queensland will not result in a fundamental tearing of the fabric of society in Queensland. The social sky will not fall in on Queenslanders. This is an arrangement that people will have to think about very carefully. From the demonstrated history of other jurisdictions where this has occurred, no floodgates have opened. People are not rushing to do this, because it is a very serious matter indeed. We say that Queenslanders are best positioned to make those decisions and ultimately apply to a court if they want a parenting or parentage order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048901"></A>
In respect of mandatory criminal history screening for a prospective birth mother or intending parents, as the honourable member will no doubt understand from his detailed reading of the report, the parliamentary committee concluded that the potential risk to children should remain as an issue to be addressed in counselling. The government bill requires intending parents, the birth mother and the birth mother’s spouse to have undergone counselling before entering into a surrogacy arrangement. The government bill also requires all the parties to be assessed by an independent and appropriately qualified counsellor before the court makes a parentage order, at which time the counsellor is required to prepare and provide to the court a surrogacy guidance report. In the surrogacy guidance report, the counsellor is required to give an opinion about whether the making of the parentage order will be in the best interests of the child. Will those issues be mandatory? No. Would they be taken into account? I would be very surprised if they would not be. Those are the things that parents themselves will think about very carefully before entering into a surrogacy arrangement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048902"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Attorney-General, but his answer does not give me any confidence. From his answer I am taking it that, if intended parents failed a criminal history check or had some sort of criminal history that was inappropriate, if they were to take possession or custodianship of the child, or if the intended parent or parents had a communicable disease, they would still have a right to participate in surrogacy under Queensland law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048903"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The only other thing I would add is that these arrangements are exactly the same as the arrangements set out in the bill moved in the parliament by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and supported, as I understand, on a binding basis by their party room. There was no conscience involved in their vote on their bill or on ours. The question, of course, could properly be put by the member for Burnett. No doubt it was considered by their party room before the bill was introduced to the parliament and the question could also be answered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048905"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I refer the Attorney to clause 6(2)(c), which reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1048907"></A>
... the long-term health and wellbeing of parties to a surrogacy arrangement and their families should be promoted ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048909"></A>
I refer to that subclause in the light of my comments during my speech when I expressed my concerns at the lack of any provision, it would appear, for counselling for the children the subject of these surrogacy arrangements and, indeed, for other children in the family situation--siblings--who might require, and in my view probably would require, counselling in their youth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048910"></A>
As I understand it, there are similar provisions provided for free counselling for children the subject of adoption arrangements, and I would submit that it is perfectly reasonable for this type of counselling to be made available to children who are the results of surrogacy arrangements. I would ask the Attorney whether he would undertake to investigate the applicability of the provision of a counselling service similar to that which I believe operates in the adoption area to this area as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052398"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Toowoomba North for his question. It is an important matter. We want to ensure children are well protected by this process. I said to the member for Toowoomba North in my speech in reply after the second reading debate that it is something I am happy to consider. My view at this time is that the number of people, as demonstrated by other jurisdictions--and as I just put on the parliamentary record--where surrogacy has been regulated, is relatively small. There will be a small number of people. I know how concerned the member for Toowoomba North is for young people in Queensland society. He is a very compassionate man. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052400"></A>
I am happy to consider it and consider what arrangements, if any, should be put in place. This was the subject of very considerable cabinet consideration on many occasions where a whole range of issues, such as counselling, were considered. I am not at liberty to discuss cabinet deliberations. But I can assure him that within government there has been very broad consideration of a whole range of issues. I am happy to consider it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052401"></A>
I do think we probably need to see how the process goes, how many people engage and how many people seek parentage orders. Children will be protected in the sense that there will be no obscuring of their identity. They are entitled to obtain details of their birth parent once they turn 18 or prior to the age of 18 with the consent of all parties who enter into the surrogacy arrangement. I think that is a very important thing so people have a sense of their identity. I am happy to consider it and discuss that with the member subsequent to the passage of the bill hopefully through the House and its proclamation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052402"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would ask the minister to do so in the light of what he has revealed has been the lack, if you like, of utilisation of surrogacy orders in other states. It obviously would not be an expensive endeavour to provide that counselling based on what has been the record in other states. Therefore, in my submission, it would be affordable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052403"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am happy to do that. I would also encourage the member for Toowoomba North to engage in rigorous discussions with the honourable Treasurer and Premier as well in relation to appropriate funding allocations for this matter. It would perhaps not be the Department of Justice and Attorney-General that would carry out the counselling or direct people in that way; it might be another agency of government or another department. The member’s point is well made and it will be taken into account as the government considers that proposal. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052408"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.43 pm): Clause 11 relates to the meaning of a birth mother’s surrogacy costs. Could the Attorney-General inform the House who enforces or will check to make sure that the surrogacy costs are in keeping with the spirit, if not the letter, of this clause? Is there a figure that would trigger an investigation? Could the minister provide the House with an estimate? Has his department done any research on an estimated cost that would cause alarm for the government? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052409"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Clause 11 is in exactly the same terms as the bill moved through the parliament and proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the honourable member for Burnett’s political party in this place except of course where ‘surrogacy arrangement’ is referred to in the government’s bill it is referred to as an ‘eligible surrogacy arrangement’ in the opposition’s bill. No doubt this was a matter of rigorous discussion in the opposition’s party room before the bill was introduced. That question can be properly answered, if it has not been already, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052410"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am quite disappointed that the Attorney-General has adopted that churlish and arrogant tone during a very important debate in Queensland’s history. I have asked a very simple question that many of my constituents would like answered. What does the minister expect a reasonable figure will be for a birth mother’s surrogacy costs? This is an area where, if it is rorted, can be used to enter into some sort of de facto non-altruistic surrogacy agreement. I would appreciate it if the minister would provide this place with an answer. He may think that he is offending me personally but he is offending the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052411"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I reject utterly that I am being churlish and arrogant in response to the honourable member. I find it extraordinary that I am being asked questions about a clause in a bill that his political party has introduced into the parliament. It is exactly the same as the government’s bill. It is surprising that the member for Burnett would speak at length about legislation in this House, so confident was he in his position about the merits of the relevant legislation, and then come in here now and start asking questions about the same legislation that he presumably was in a position to support or question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052412"></A>
Reasonable costs are of course reasonable. It is an extraordinary suggestion that there will be a whole range of surrogate mothers lining up to rort the expenses, which is what he is suggesting. He says that this is a way for women to go through the whole process of having a baby through a surrogate arrangement and get a bit of cash on the side. What an extraordinary suggestion. As I have said, these are arrangements that people will think extraordinarily carefully about--that is, to go through the process of having a surrogate child’s name transferred to them through a parentage order. It is not something that can be done in an afternoon. People will apply themselves very seriously and diligently to this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1192460"></A>
It would appear on the available evidence not insignificant or enormous numbers and for reasonable costs to be recovered. Reasonable costs will depend on the nature of the case and the nature of the birth mother’s status. One would hope that consenting adults reaching this arrangement would be able to discuss those matters and discuss them fully and openly as they move through the process. I do not think surrogate mothers will be lining up to do this unless they have a very close and personal relationship with the intending parents. The nature of those expenses will depend on the individual case but of course they must be reasonable and accord with the other matters set out in the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1192461"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I acknowledge upfront that I have opposed these bills. That avoids a lot of invective. I think the question is reasonable so I will put it in a different context. Whilst most of the arrangements for surrogacy will be, as the Attorney-General has outlined, between caring people and, one would hope, with a surrogate that they know, if we look at overseas where altruistic as well as commercial surrogacy is in existence there have been instances where the surrogate has sadly seen it as a commercial arrangement only and there have been significant costs. We only usually see this in the media when the whole process goes sour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055913"></A>
Again, I acknowledge that I will be opposing these bills. My question is: will there be any audit type process to ensure that the introduction of this legislation in this state does not unintentionally drift down towards a pseudo commercial process? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055916"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The point made by the member for Gladstone is well made. I think in the second reading speech I did make it clear--and the point is well made--that all of us in this parliament stand very firmly against commercial surrogacy. That is why the government’s bill makes it an extraterritorial offence for a Queenslander to enter into a commercial surrogacy arrangement. Any commercial surrogacy arrangement entered into by a Queensland resident anywhere will be a criminal offence. The point that the honourable member makes is a very important one: children should not be borne from commercial arrangements. The government stands very firmly against that. </Hansard-Body>

All I can say is that there will not be an audit process that goes through. Ultimately, the parties could dispute the reasonable expenses and that could be a matter that, ultimately, would be determined by a court with appropriate jurisdiction. The bill sets out what type of expenses may be reimbursed--and we articulate that clearly in the bill--that are considered reasonable surrogacy costs. When the birth mother, her spouse, if any, and the intended parents are considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement, they must obtain independent legal advice also. As part of this advice the parties will be informed of the right of the birth mother to be reimbursed her reasonable surrogacy costs. Reasonable surrogacy costs that may be paid to the birth mother will be those that are set out in the surrogacy arrangement and only those that are permitted under the government bill. If there are any disputes about the payment of these costs, as I have indicated, the legislation allows the birth mother to seek enforcement of these expenses provided she has relinquished the child and consented to the making of the parentage order. </Hansard-Body>

The other issue is that there is a non-relinquishment aspect to the government bill. Women will not be required to relinquish the child. Surrogate mothers will not be required to relinquish the surrogate child. We think that is an important principle, too. Even if the arrangement is entered into and everyone checks all the boxes effectively but at the end of the day the surrogate mother gives birth to the child and does not wish to relinquish the child, she cannot be forced to do so. At the same time she will not be entitled to recover any costs of the pregnancy. We think that is a fair arrangement between the parties. We will not be conducting a formal audit of that. As I said earlier, I think adults, hopefully, who enter into this will have done so very thoughtfully, very carefully and will reach an agreement between themselves as to reasonable costs. Hopefully, we will not see anyone disputing them. </Hansard-Body>

There has indeed been much discussion over the past 24 hours or so in this place about the differences between the government’s bill and the LNP’s bill. Fundamentally, whilst there is much to say with regard to seeking to decriminalise non-commercial surrogacy, certainly it is a bone of contention if it extends to single and same-sex couples. This particular amendment seeks to refine and define who is eligible for a surrogacy arrangement. That would actually apply only to couples who are heterosexual, either married or de facto. There is a number of amendments here. They are all consequential on that, including an amendment that needs to suspend the section of the Anti-Discrimination Act. That provision is extremely similar to what was put through this parliament last year when the new Adoption Act was passed to ensure that same-sex couples and singles were not able to adopt in the best interests of the child. This is a virtually identical clause, a virtually identical setting aside of the Anti-Discrimination Act in this case. That refinement of who is eligible and the processes that lead up to it are consequential amendments in the other clauses and relate to actually restricting to whom non-commercial surrogacy is available and that is to opposite-sex couples only. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for seeking the leave of the parliament to move these amendments en bloc. I appreciate that that has contributed significantly to the reduction in the time for this debate. The matters are important and I will address him on those various clauses that he is seeking to amend, as I will all members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055928"></A>
The government is of the view that there should not be any restrictions on who can enter into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement and that only commercial surrogacy should be prohibited. The opposition’s amendments do not align with the government’s position that there should not be any restrictions on who can enter into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement. Opposition amendment Nos 7, 8, 9 and 10 have the effect of limiting who may be eligible to enter into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement to married couples and heterosexual de facto couples who have lived together in a de facto relationship for two years. Anyone else who enters into an altruistic surrogacy arrangement will be committing a criminal offence under the opposition’s amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055929"></A>
The government does not support those amendments. It is unfair and discriminatory to a class of Queenslanders and, in my view, is not in accordance with the parliamentary committee’s recommendations. It is not in the best interests of children born from these other altruistic surrogacy arrangements. I articulated that at length in my speech in reply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055930"></A>
I also note that proposed amendment No. 6 allows a person to make a decision or do an act that is necessary to comply with this act despite the operation of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991. For example, under the bill an independent and appropriately qualified counsellor is required to prepare a surrogacy guidance report to the court. The opposition amendment No. 6 would allow the report writer in arriving at recommendations to base his or her recommendations on what might be otherwise considered discriminatory grounds. So, for example, in the situation where one of the parents has a physical disability and is still able to appropriately care for the child but the report writer is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child to live with someone with a physical disability, the opposition amendment would allow such a discriminatory report to be prepared. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not wish to labour the point because it has been very much debated--the individual ideology and philosophy over the last day or so. This is not just a view that is held by members on this side; it is actually held by members across the political spectrum. We have also heard from members on the other side of the House during the course of their contribution about what they believe the notion should be with regard to who is eligible to have access to a non-commercial surrogacy arrangement. That is where we come from with regard to this and it ensures consistency in our particular approach.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059535"></A>
As I indicated yesterday in my speech, I believe that this matter should be dealt with by the Supreme Court of Queensland. It is the jurisdiction that I believe is the most relevant when it comes to dealing with the status of children. I understand that there was some original recommendation made that the Supreme Court should be the jurisdiction that decides the status of children in Queensland. The reason for that, in my view, is that, until more recent times, with the transfer of certain residual family law matters to the Commonwealth jurisdiction, the Supreme Court in Queensland dealt with matters relating to children of a non-married or de facto relationship in the state of Queensland. So there is some degree of expertise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059536"></A>
 I understand the government’s logic that has been put forward, and that is that the matters should be dealt with in the District Court because they have the Children’s Court jurisdiction. I do not necessarily subscribe to that view, because a lot of that expertise relates to the District Court dealing with children who are before that court charged with a criminal matter. My view is that if you are going to be deciding the status of children then it is important to have that status decided in the highest court in the state of Queensland, and that is the Supreme Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059537"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government does not accept the amendment, which has the effect of providing that applications for transfer of parentage should be dealt with by the Supreme Court rather than the Children’s Court, constituted by a District Court judge. There is a very good reason for that. The government consulted with the judiciary on the parliamentary committee’s recommendation that the Supreme Court deal with these applications. The advice from the heads of jurisdiction was that the Children’s Court, constituted by a District Court judge, is the most appropriate court to deal with these applications, given that court’s expertise in dealing with issues around what is in the best interests of a child under a range of state legislation.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.08 pm): In this clause the government defines who the intended parents are--a man and an eligible woman, or two men, or two eligible women. If it could be proved that there were two men and a woman living in a committed relationship, would the surrogacy arrangements be illegal under this legislation? Similarly, if it could be proved that there were two women and a man living in a committed relationship, would the surrogacy arrangement be illegal? Why has the Attorney-General stopped defining intended parents at two men and two women? There are other sorts of social arrangements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059542"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In the end they are the most common forms of relationships in society. I understand that the member for Burnett is talking about other relationships--two men and a woman or two women and a man. Perhaps there are other relationships like that in society, but I would suggest that they are very much the exception. In my experience, anyway--I have not experienced any of them personally or by knowledge--they are so unusual as to, I suppose, fall outside what would be contemplated by this legislation. The government has formed a policy decision on the broad nature of individuals who would be willing to have families in Queensland and that is why we have defined them as such. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063448"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am surprised that the Attorney-General finds it so surprising that there would be relationships like one man and two women living together in a committed relationship. This is a multicultural society. There are, in fact, large communities--the Islamic community, for example--that have one man and two women as the cultural norm. I think that the question has relevance. The point that I am making is that this government is making out that we are the ones who discriminate in our social and legislative choices when, in fact, it is the government that is discriminating in this case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063450"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am not saying that the question is irrelevant. The honourable member is very much entitled to ask any questions he wishes of me in these sorts of debates. I would say that it would not be illegal for those people to enter into such an arrangement, even to have a child, but they would not be able to get a parenting order transferring parentage of the child outside of the proposed eligibility arrangements. That is restricted to a couple defined as being a person and their spouse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063451"></A>
While I acknowledge that there are many permutations and combinations of how people live together, we believe that very broadly we have covered the field. As the honourable member suggests, there may be a man and two women. A person can only be married to one person in Australia. That is what is defined under the Marriage Act. It is a crime to enter into more than one marriage being defined as a relationship between a man and a woman. Even then, if there were more than one wife but not a formal marriage, there would still be a principal partnership which might mean people are eligible to enter into a surrogacy arrangement. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
This is one of the clauses that poses the most challenge to people not only in this chamber but also in the community and the notion of surrogacy in the general sense. I have the greatest sympathy for a woman who cannot conceive. I cannot imagine the tragedy that a couple would feel if they were told that any children that they were able to conceive would be genetically challenged, would have a physical, psychological or mental impairment. To live with that sort of knowledge would be incredibly difficult. I also acknowledge that practically surrogacy is an answer. However, for reasons that I placed on the record in my contribution at the second reading stage, I cannot support it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063453"></A>
Much of the objection in the community is contained in clause 14(1)(b) and that is the types of family arrangements that will be eligible to access these surrogacy arrangements and the concern in the community from caring men and women who acknowledge that there are family arrangements that differ but still hold an objection to the extent of the surrogacy arrangement eligibility. I will oppose this clause. It is one of the main clauses in the bill that has caused anxiety and concern in the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063454"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for her comments. The only thing I would say in response is that while some people in the community would not necessarily support the proposal the government has put forward, it would appear on the available research that the government is aware of--certainly the Galaxy poll--that two-thirds of Queenslanders believe same-sex couples should be recognised at law as being the parents of children. That seems to be a solid survey and Galaxy has been quoted by both sides in the House today. In a sense there is a significant number of Queenslanders who believe that those sorts of relationships should be recognised. I do acknowledge the points made by the member for Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063455"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 A moment ago I moved some amendments that were to set up and facilitate further amendments that I would be moving after clause 112 that go right back to the clause which deals with the definition of who is an eligible person for a surrogacy arrangement. That amendment will be that a heterosexual couple are eligible for it, whether they be married or in a de facto relationship. Those other amendments that did not get through before were crucial to the whole process of ensuring that there was consistency within the act. It is true that this particular definition is one of the things that people labour on. It contains many of the reasons for objection and concern in this parliament, notwithstanding what the member for Gladstone said in this place yesterday. She said that it is certainly possible for someone to love and respect somebody and to work with somebody without necessarily accepting their viewpoint or necessarily accepting what they advocate or seek to achieve. That is paraphrasing the member for Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059557"></A>
That is true. I do not think anyone should be put in a box. They should not be labelled a homophobe if they do not agree to that clause and a sycophant if they do. I stood in this place yesterday and indicated that I would support a bill where we did give statutory recognition to children of same-sex couples who exist in our community, and they are principally same-sex females who have gone through their own fertilisation arrangements to achieve their aim of having a child. Those children are out there. They are in limbo land. I would support that without any hesitation. There is a big difference between supporting that and having something where the state is proactively facilitating, through its legislative ability, something that changes the notion of family. That is the concern that I have. I do not think that we should be mixing up those two issues.</Hansard-Body>

These amendments principally relate to amendments which I sought to get through earlier. They are consequential to the position which I have outlined--that is, the issue of same-sex and single parenting--and which is the fundamental concern and difference between the LNP’s bill before the parliament and the government’s bill. People may actually ask why there are so many consequential amendments. The simple reality is that, notwithstanding that the two bills--the government bill and the opposition bill--are basically similar, if you change one section of a bill for a small principle issue then a range of consequential amendments need to be made along the way. This actually relates to the particular issue of same-sex and single surrogacy which has been the concern that I and other members have outlined in the parliament during the last day or so.</Hansard-Body>

 And these amendments seek to amend significantly from that clause to clause 112. I might leave it for now, until other people deal with this and I will come back to that point. Basically, this relates to the facilitation of the amendment that I sought to move before dinner which relates to the issue of prescribing that surrogacy should only be available to heterosexual couples whether they be in a de facto or a married relationship. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for moving these 111 amendments en bloc. The amendments are not supported by the government. As previously stated, the government does not support altruistic surrogacy being limited to a married couple or a heterosexual de facto couple who have had a relationship of at least two years in duration. </Hansard-Body>

(i) 	was at least 25 years when the surrogacy arrangement was made ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072656"></A>
I choose to speak about this, because the government once again has tried to take the high moral ground in suggesting that it is the party which does not discriminate and that we are the party on this side which discriminates. In fact, male same-sex couples and single people who are under 25 are discriminated against. Everyone under 25 is discriminated against by this clause. Perhaps the Attorney-General would like to clarify why they have decided on the age of 25. Why that point of difference? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072657"></A>
There seems to be a dangerous inconsistency in applying the 25-year age limit. I can give an example. If a 27-year-old male was married to a 23-year-old female or they were in a de facto relationship and both of them applied to be the intended parents under this surrogacy legislation, they as a couple would not be eligible under this legislation. As it quite clearly states under (g), the applicant or each of the joint applicants must be at least 25 years old. In that case, the joint applicants would not qualify under this clause. However, if the 27-year-old applied singularly to qualify as an intended surrogate, that person would be eligible under this legislation. I would like the Attorney-General to clarify that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not want to delay debate, but there are some matters I need to put on the record. They will perhaps clarify issues for the honourable member. In relation to the age of relevant parties entering into a surrogacy agreement, that involves complex emotional issues as well as complicated legal implications, particularly where one of the parties decides not to follow through with the arrangement. If parties are aged at least 25 years when they enter into a surrogacy arrangement, they are more likely to understand and manage the social, emotional and legal implications that flow from entering into a surrogacy arrangement and are better able to make informed choices about whether or not to enter into such an arrangement. Requiring a birth mother to be at least 25 years prior to entering into a surrogacy arrangement will ensure that the birth mother has had sufficient life experiences, is emotionally and socially mature, and is able to consider her legal and social positions before freely consenting to enter into a surrogacy arrangement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072659"></A>
Intended parents who are at least 25 years old before entering into a surrogacy arrangement will be emotionally and socially mature to understand the implications of entering into a surrogacy arrangement and will be in a more settled stage of their lives and prepared to raise a family. The imposition of an age requirement will ensure that surrogacy arrangements are not entered into lightly and that the best interests of a child who is born following a surrogacy arrangement are preserved. I note that both Victoria and Western Australia require the birth mother to be at least 25 years old before entering into a surrogacy arrangement. It is important from the government’s perspective that no vulnerable person falls into a surrogacy agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072660"></A>
In relation to the various matters put forward by the honourable member concerning the people of differential age, it would seem unusual that a 27-year-old and a 23-year-old would seek to circumvent the arrangements when by the mere passage of two years they could both satisfy the requirements of the law. I do not think we will be looking at a large number of people who will be seeking to circumvent these requirements. People will either want to properly enter into a surrogacy arrangement and go through all of those requirements or not. I do not think we are setting up a regime where people will do their best to get around it. If they do not want to have a transfer of parentage order, they do not have to. What we are saying is that it will not be a crime for them to be a surrogate parent, but they will not be able to transfer the child’s name into their own. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072661"></A>
It would seem to me that, in the case put forward by the honourable member, if a 27-year-old person in a committed relationship purported to be single, they are the sorts of things that an independent counsellor would ask. Presumably an independent counsellor would ask a single person if they were purporting to enter into a surrogacy arrangement whether they were single, for how long they had been single, whether they had been in a relationship, and if so for how long and with whom--those sorts of things. If people want to circumvent the law and mislead the court, they would have to swear to the court their marital status, their relationship status or otherwise. They would presumably have to swear false evidence to a court if they were 27 and in a relationship but wanted to put forward the fact that they were single. You cannot stop people doing deliberate acts contrary to the law, but I do not think the circumstances posed by the honourable member are likely to occur in many circumstances, if at all. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Attorney-General for his reply. All I would say is that in the phrasing of this clause there is an inherent bias in this particular case for people to approach singularly. There is no recognition of that committed relationship between a person who is older than 25 and someone who may be under 25.</Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.49 pm): This clause relates to the additional requirement for multiple births. I am having difficulty understanding this clause and I would like clarification of it from the Attorney-General. Is this clause actually saying that a surrogate birth mother who gives birth to multiple babies has the ability to offer as a surrogate child just one of those babies? What are the rights and implications for the siblings of that surrogate child? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078506"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Clause 24 explains what orders a court may make where there are multiple births from a pregnancy that is the result of a surrogacy arrangement. Where the child has a living birth sibling the court can only make a parentage order about the child if it also makes a parentage order about each other living birth sibling in the applicant’s or joint applicants’ favour. ‘Birth sibling’ is defined to mean a brother or sister of the child who was born as a result of the same pregnancy as the child. Therefore, if twins are born as a result of the pregnancy that occurred as a result of the surrogacy arrangement the parentage order must be made in relation to both children and to the same intended parents. That provision is identical to the clause put forward in the bill moved through the parliament by the member for Southern Downs. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.51 pm): This clause relates to commercial surrogacy arrangements that are prohibited. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078512"></A>
A person must not enter into or offer to enter into a commercial surrogacy arrangement. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078513"></A>
It notes there that the maximum penalty is only 100 penalty units or three years imprisonment. If this legislation that will pass through this place was ever used to help commercial surrogacy then I am sure that both sides of this House would agree that it would be a very bad outcome for Queensland society. Commercial surrogacy obviously has greater inherent dangers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078514"></A>
What I would simply note and ask the Attorney-General and those opposite to think about is that perhaps 100 penalty units is not a big enough fine. That works out to about $10,000. In light of the fact that this government has 1,000 penalty units as a maximum fine for someone who is, for example, convicted of harassing a flying fox out of its roost then that would seem to be the standard that this government should live by. The Attorney-General should think about increasing the penalty units in this particular clause.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078515"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I note the honourable member’s comments. I would indicate that it is for the court to determine the appropriate sentence for any contravention of this particular section of the act once the bill is passed. I note his comments on penalty units but, of course, someone can be imprisoned for up to three years. That is a significant period of time for someone who seeks to enter into a commercial surrogacy arrangement. A court should have a broad discretion depending on all the facts and circumstances of the case. But up to three years imprisonment is quite significant and something the court would consider. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.54 pm): I want to make a comment about clause 100. It relates to a number of other clauses that address this issue of the status of children who are born into relationships, generally with same-sex mothers. There is this limbo land of identity for these people. There is some concern about what might happen to those children in the event that something happens to the mother of the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078520"></A>
As I indicated throughout my speech in the second reading debate and again today, this is something which I did not necessarily want tied up in the one bill. I thought this was an important enough issue to stand alone. It should not have been contaminated with the other issues surrounding same-sex or single-parent surrogacy. I think it is important that we actually recognise the situation that these people find themselves in. It is extremely important to ensure that they have certainty and comfort in the event that one of the parents actually meets with an untimely end or something unfortunate happens. We need to provide certainty in that situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078521"></A>
Regardless of what people might think about the family environment we are talking about, these families do exist in the community and they want certainty. There is a strong argument, given the fact that these children are out there and they have carers looking after them, that one person has recognition as a parent. We do not object to this legislative provision. We do believe, however, that if it was to be introduced it should have been introduced in another bill which was not necessarily contaminated with the issues that we have seen so passionately debated here in the last few days. </Hansard-Body>

The South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009-2031 speaks volumes about the Queensland we all want to see over the next two decades. The plan is about securing green space for communities and improving our lifestyle by reducing travel time between home, work and play. It forecasts the work that needs to be done to keep the region evolving and adapting to the different challenges that it will face as it continues to grow.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084634"></A>
There has been much debate about the growth of Queensland and, in particular, the South-East Queensland region. There are some who say that population estimates are untenable while others say that there is more than enough room to accommodate them if we do it right. Doing it right is what the Queensland government wants to do. Our challenge is getting Queensland ready to support the expected increase in population to ensure that our quality of life is not compromised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084636"></A>
There is much speculation about what we can do about growth and how we deal with the pressures and the opportunities that this growth brings. In a wider context, South-East Queensland is projected to have an estimated resident population of 4.4 million, accounting for around one-fifth of Australia’s population. These are not targets to be achieved; these are estimates that we need to prepare for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084639"></A>
Population growth in South-East Queensland is driven by a number of national trends including the steady and increasing overseas migration intake, which is the largest factor, a movement of population from interstate, the move to coastal living based on climate and lifestyle values, the increased reliance on knowledge based tourism, manufacturing and service sector employment located in large urban centres, and an increase in the natural birth rate--something we have been discussing so far this evening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084640"></A>
Statutory plans provide a strategic direction for getting the growth into the right areas. The South East Queensland Regional Plan includes land covered by 11 local governments. Its regional landscape is a rich mix of bushland, beaches, ranges and paddocks, rivers and lakes. The South-East Queensland region covers 22,890 square kilometres, stretching 240 kilometres from Noosa in the north to the Queensland-New South Wales border in the south and 160 kilometres west to Toowoomba. The plan identifies growth areas, principal activity centres, and employment and industry centres for state agencies. It also highlights future education, recreation and health precincts across the region. It provides the direction to local councils needed to manage their area in the context of the wider region. Growth generates demand for new jobs, new housing and the provision of a wide range of supporting infrastructure and services from arterial roads and public transport to local parks, shops and community facilities. The growth also creates economic and social opportunities for the residents of the region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084642"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan is the Queensland government’s long-term plan to guide appropriate growth, change and development in the region. Since it was first introduced in 2005, the South East Queensland Regional Plan has been very successful in protecting more than 85 per cent of the region from further urban development and improving housing densities and integrated residential, employment and infrastructure planning. The plan received a National Award of Excellence from the Planning Institute of Australia. The South East Queensland Regional Plan sits within the Queensland land use planning system and reflects and informs state planning policy and priorities as well as local government plans and policies. It is both a statutory and a strategic plan with a planning and implementation time frame over 20 years with a provision to be reviewed every five years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084644"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan was prepared through consultation and cooperation between state, local government and the wider community to address the region’s values, challenges and opportunities. The South East Queensland Regional Plan establishes a framework to manage projected growth, not just accommodate it. It utilises the following key tools to manage growth: establishing an urban footprint as a means to control unplanned urban expansion; promoting a compact urban form by setting dwelling targets within existing urban areas for each local government area; supporting growth in the western corridor; allocating land to accommodate future urban growth supported by a range of delivery processes; defining principles and policies to guide growth, change and development; linking the plan with state infrastructure and service delivery; and informing local government infrastructure programs and budgets, and providing certainty to the private sector. The plan strikes a balance between population growth and the need to protect the lifestyle that residents of the south-east value and enjoy by guiding development patterns in the region over the next two decades. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090773"></A>
From 2006 to 2031, an additional 754,000 dwellings will be required to cater for the expected population growth in South-East Queensland and provide housing choices for a more diverse population. Again, this is not a target that the government has set for itself; it is an estimated projection which we need to prepare for. The SEQ Regional Plan seeks to proactively manage this dwelling demand by identifying a preferred settlement pattern. The plan redistributes the projected dwelling demand throughout South-East Queensland based on a preferred settlement pattern of relieving pressures on the coast, redistributing growth to the western corridor around Ipswich, promoting renewal and transit oriented development in existing centres, redeveloping infrastructure rich areas and maximising residential yield in major new residential communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090774"></A>
As I said, the settlement pattern protects 85 per cent of the region by restricting large scale and inappropriate urban development outside the urban footprint. This ensures that development occurs within the urban footprint in locations that provide ready access to infrastructure and services, especially those that help to reduce car dependency. A strong focus of the settlement pattern is looking at redirecting growth to existing urban areas while maintaining a supply of broad-hectare land for the development of new communities. Notably, the SEQ Regional Plan sets an infill target for the additional dwellings that will be required in SEQ by 2031. Nearly half are to be built in established urban areas through infill and redevelopment--the renewal communities that our cities need.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Clearly, not all future dwelling demand will be met in this manner. Development of master planned communities on broad-hectare land will also accommodate a significant share of dwelling activity in addition to dwelling construction on existing vacant residential lots. Broad-hectare opportunities are distributed throughout the region. However, the SEQ Regional Plan aims to ensure that an increased proportion of the region’s population and employment growth is accommodated in the new communities of the western corridor, thus reducing growth pressures on the coast. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1090776"></A>
Let me make it clear: the plan is not about wall-to-wall skyscrapers across the region, as we might hear from some quarters; it is about giving people a choice. There will always be room for a home on a good sized block with a traditional backyard, just as other people will opt for the convenience of living in higher density areas around activity centres or along our public transport corridors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090777"></A>
The SEQ Regional Plan’s balanced approach to settlement and compact urban development contains growth pressures that preserve the region’s landscape, natural areas, open space and prime agricultural land. It is also cheaper and more efficient, as existing infrastructure is used before new houses need to be built further out. Placing urban uses in close proximity in and around centres makes healthy alternatives to driving, such as walking or cycling, more viable. Less fuel is used for regular travel and fewer greenhouse gases are emitted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090778"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, the SEQ Regional Plan is both a strategic and a statutory planning instrument. The South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009-2031 state planning regulatory provisions were established to support the regional plan. The regulatory provisions apply to the SEQ region and assist in advancing key elements of the SEQ Regional Plan. The regulatory provisions have effect under the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 and are used in conjunction with the other relevant state and local planning requirements including, very importantly, local government planning schemes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090781"></A>
Broadly, the regulatory provisions apply to particular development applications in South-East Queensland. Key elements of the regulatory provisions are: a regional land use map that indicates which areas will be protected as regional landscape and rural production areas or rural living areas and which are designated as the urban footprint; restrictions on urban development outside the urban footprint; prohibiting inappropriate subdivision of land outside the urban footprint; and protecting areas identified to accommodate future urban growth from inappropriate development until suitable planning has been undertaken.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090782"></A>
Whilst there are some development restrictions in place, it is important to note that the regulatory provisions maintain existing use rights for land outside the urban footprint. This ensures that significant activities, such as agricultural production, access to natural resources, water storage, tourism, outdoor recreation and nature conservation, will continue. Further, the regulatory provisions facilitate a diverse rural economy by supporting small and medium scale tourist, sport and recreation and rural industries in that regional landscape and rural production area and rural living area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090783"></A>
Developing the regional plan is not the end of the process. It needs to be implemented. Implementing the plan involves both state and local governments together with the support of the community, industry and regional stakeholders. Councils play a vital role as the planning authority to shape their region to best service their communities within the overarching guide of this regional plan. The SEQ Regional Plan will also be regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that it continues to provide the most appropriate framework for managing growth and change in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090784"></A>
The state government recognises apprehension about growth in the community. We understand that further action is required to address emerging challenges within the community, such as housing affordability, traffic congestion, climate change and employment generation. The Queensland government has implemented several actions to meet these challenges. We have, however, also gone a step further. Last last year, the Premier announced that the Queensland government will hold a growth summit in late March 2010. The growth summit is a great opportunity to bring together people from across South-East Queensland--and indeed across the whole state of Queensland--to help us lead the nation into the next period of prosperity. It will also help us continue to enjoy the best lifestyle in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090785"></A>
A high-level advisory team has been appointed to play an important role in the summit. This team of experts has a wealth of knowledge in areas such as population trends, climate change, architecture, planning and industry more generally. So strong representation at the summit is anticipated from people in South-East Queensland and other regions, including mayors and other community leaders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090786"></A>
Regional planning plays a key role in helping Queensland meet the challenges associated with managing rapid growth, population change, economic development and the increasing demand for infrastructure across multiple local government areas. On that note, I commend the motion to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (8.17 pm): I rise to second the motion moved by the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning to ratify the South East Queensland Regional Plan. In 2010 growth is a reality for Queensland, just as it was in the previous 150 years of this parliament’s history. Growth for us is a given. It is not our responsibility to choose it but to manage it. As legislators, we face a fundamental choice in the south-east between choosing to renew existing communities and have a higher level of density within those existing communities and choosing to have unchecked urban sprawl. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090789"></A>
As the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning has outlined, this government chooses good, high-quality growth with renewed inner city communities, we choose to have a regional plan that protects green space and protects our heritage areas, we choose to have a regional plan that ensures community input into decision making about the future of local communities and we choose to have a regional plan that, along with supporting the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program, provides infrastructure to ensure that our wonderful quality of life is preserved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096981"></A>
It would be easier for all of us to imagine that we could simply say, ‘Not in my backyard’, and to imagine that we could simply choose not to have growth happen anywhere around us. But we must understand the consequence of that choice. If we say there will be no growth near us, we need to understand that the costs to all of us of providing infrastructure to unchecked urban sprawl are enormous. A study last year released by Parsons Brinckerhoff and Curtin University reveals it costs on average $309 million to provide infrastructure for every thousand dwellings in inner urban areas compared to $653 million to provide new infrastructure to growing outer communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096985"></A>
In addition to that economic cost that communities bear, we need to understand that there is also a significant social cost of unchecked urban sprawl. A significant body of social evidence, most notably that of Robert Putnam, has shown very clearly that in communities where people on average commute by more than an hour, individuals face a lower individual quality of life but also the quality of community interaction is severely diminished because people simply do not spend time in the communities where they live. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096987"></A>
It is necessary also to understand, and I add this as the Minister for Transport, that it is generally understood that public transport is only viable at an average urban density of 15 dwellings per hectare. If you have a lower density than that, public transport becomes essentially unaffordable to provide. Members have to understand that in the south-east we already provide a subsidy of $3 in taxpayer subsidy for every dollar that a public transport commuter pays in fare. If we start providing public transport to areas of very low population density then that taxpayer contribution naturally becomes much greater again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096988"></A>
To give members an example of that, in Brisbane there are very few public transport services which go close to breaking even. By far the best of them financially, and this will not be surprising, is the 199 bus service that runs from West End through the city and on to New Farm. Of course that is going to be the case in the inner city and we cannot expect to replicate that kind of model everywhere, but it is worth noting that we can provide economically a much more efficient and more regular bus service in an area of high population density which, of course, is also close to the places where people go for work and recreation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096989"></A>
This government, in partnership with the regional plan, has a well developed program of providing public transport infrastructure. Recently, for instance, the $324 million Robina to Varsity Lakes rail extension was opened. Last year we opened the next stage of the Northern Busway through to the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096990"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Go the busway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096991"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And the next stage of the Eastern Busway from the Eleanor Schonell Bridge to the South East Busway at Buranda. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096992"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Hear, hear! Go the busways.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096993"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It needs to be understood that those two projects, of which the member for Mansfield is such an avid fan, were extremely expensive. The Northern Busway cost $198 million to build and the Eastern Busway in the section that I just mentioned came at a cost of $366 million. We now have under construction the next stage of the Northern Busway from Windsor on to Kedron at a projected cost of $777 million. There is a range of projects underway but to give members another example, the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project building light rail on the coast will come at a cost of $949 million. Those very substantial infrastructure costs, as well as the running costs of public transport that I spoke about, are ultimately borne by our community. That kind of infrastructure and running cost can, of course, only be supported if there is a degree of population density to support it. We simply cannot choose to have both unchecked urban sprawl and a sustainable community with a high level of public transport provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096994"></A>
As a whole range of research has shown, but most notably that from Jago Dodson and Neil Sipe at Griffith University, it is extremely difficult and expensive to provide genuine transport choices to people who live in outer metropolitan areas. So it is important that there be a combination of detailed regional planning--that is essentially the work that the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning is doing--along with a detailed infrastructure plan that provides things like busways in the inner city and rail extensions to the outer suburbs so as to provide transport choices to people in outer metropolitan areas. But those things must be done together because if they are not it is quite simply not possible--not just for government, but for our community--to afford transport choices for everybody. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096995"></A>
The government will soon release the Integrated Regional Transport Plan, which will be a partner document to the regional plan and which accepts the regional plan’s planning principles and provides more detail about the next generation of transport planning going forward. As we face the challenge of growth, a challenge that is not made by the government but which must be met by the government, we cannot pretend that there is no choice to be made. We cannot pretend that we can simply have it all and that change will not come to our community. We cannot put our heads in the sand. In my view, this regional plan is a sensible document that provides for community input; it protects the green space, the heritage and the quality of life that we all enjoy and gives us a blueprint to go sustainably into a better future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr GIBSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gympie--LNP) (8.27 pm): I rise to support the motion put forward by the minister with regard to the South East Queensland Regional Plan and ratifying the provisions of the plan under section 63C of the Sustainable Planning Act. The planning process for South-East Queensland continues to have bipartisan support from the LNP. It is essential that there is bipartisan support for regional plans because those decisions that are made by industry, local government and ordinary householders need to be made with the confidence that there is support from both sides of this chamber and that regardless of which party holds government these procedures and processes will continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096998"></A>
However, the LNP and I will be expressing strong reservations about elements of the South East Queensland Regional Plan. It is not that the plan is a failure, but simply that it can be improved. There are areas that we believe can be refined and improved upon. The plan should be able to deliver on all of its requirements. The plan being put forward should be able to be achievable by all. It should not be an aspirational document. It should not be something that has the risk of falling into the realms of fantasy because it has not been properly thought through.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103190"></A>
We can see the pressure and the requirement for proper planning to take place and for the assumptions that underpin that planning to be correct. If we get it right at the beginning, we have confidence in the life of the plan. Nothing shows this better than the 2006 South East Queensland Regional Plan, which had a life of five years but was required to be reviewed within three. That occurred because the assumptions that underpinned the 2006 South East Queensland Regional Plan were found to be faulty and there was a requirement to revisit the plan and attend to those areas. It is essential that we have the confidence in those assumptions. It is essential that industry has the confidence in the ability of those elements of the plan to be delivered and that local government can move forward. It is unfortunate that the South East Queensland Regional Plan floundered at the first hurdle. This version of the South East Queensland Regional Plan is one that must last the five years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103197"></A>
Councils are not the only stakeholder but they are one of the major stakeholders in this process. They are the entities that are responsible for the implementation of the plan. I listened to the minister’s contribution and how he talked about the wide consultation. I can only note that, in a climate in which we have a war on terror and a war on climate, in South-East Queensland we now have a war on the state government, as council after council are taking the state government to task because it has not fully consulted with them as key stakeholders. We have seen a great example of that just this week with the Brisbane City Council. It is interesting because often we hear how united the Labor Party is--how Labor Party policy is accepted by all. Yet, when we look at this part of Labor Party policy, what do we find from Labor members of the Brisbane City Council? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103202"></A>
The planning committee of the Brisbane City Council has as some of its members the former chair of the planning committee, Councillor David Hinchliffe, and the current Labor spokesman for planning issues, Councillor Milton Dick--both relatives of members opposite.</Hansard-Body>

 I cannot speak for the ability of that councillor, but I note the motion that they supported this week. Let us look at the wording. The motion stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1103206"></A>
This committee: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Body-Continued>

<A ID="pgfId-1103210"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1103211"></A>
this is from Labor councillors; the policy of the Queensland Labor Party is being split from within--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1103212"></A>
would result in significant loss of character, greenspace and out-of-control development through Brisbane suburbs; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1103213"></A>
(c) 	expresses concern that the State Government thinks the views of local residents are not important--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1103214"></A>
Labor councillors on the Brisbane City Council are exposing for all that this state government does not think the views of local residents are important--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1103215"></A>
and is proposing to take more planning control from Councils, in favour of undemocratic and unrepresentative plans; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1103216"></A>
(d) 	condemns the State Government for putting the views of planners and academics ahead of Brisbane residents. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103218"></A>
There we see what Labor councillors think of the South East Queensland Regional Plan--a policy of the Labor Party on which even within its own ranks there is division. What about some of the Labor councillors themselves? Councillor Helen Abrahams has been very vocal about some elements of the plan. In a media report, she says, ‘The community cannot have any faith in this planning process.’ Yet we find that Councillor Abrahams actually voted for high-rise high density in West End. When we look at the voting record, she voted for it but now she is against it. This is what we see with Labor members. They are all over the place when it comes to the South East Queensland Regional Plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103221"></A>
The consultation with councils has been lacking, with the Moreton Bay council speaking out and the Sunshine Coast council speaking out. As I said, the latest war that we have is a war against the state government, not because the South East Queensland Regional Plan is not something that is worthy but because this state government did not listen to stakeholders in its compilation of the plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103226"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan predicts that the population of South-East Queensland will grow from 2.8 million to 4.4 million, requiring an additional 754,000 new dwellings between 2006 and 2031. The increase in dwellings varies from a 226 per cent increase in Ipswich to 100 per cent for western councils, 78 per cent for Logan, 75 per cent for Sunshine Coast, 71 per cent for the Gold Coast, 68 per cent for Toowoomba, 68 per cent for Moreton Bay, 42 per cent for Redland and 39 per cent for Brisbane. This is to be achieved by looking at infill targets and greenfield development areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103230"></A>
The challenge that we have with the South East Queensland Regional Plan with regard to infill targets is not that there is a problem with infill, nor with high density. As the minister quite rightly pointed out, there is a place for that option and it is an option that should be available for people to choose. But what we need to ensure is that it is an option that people want to choose and that it is an option that can be delivered upon by the industry. What we are hearing time and time again is that these infill targets are (1) not what the public are desiring and (2) not what industry can deliver upon within the time frame set down. So immediately we find a flaw within the plan. Immediately we find that this plan moves from being a document that we should have confidence in relying upon to a document that has been referred to me as ‘aspirational’. Aspirational is not good enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103232"></A>
I note that the minister has been quite vocal in recent days with regard to his view that duplexes should be made available and scattered across the area. I also note that he said in his speech that there will still be room for a duplex to have a backyard. As an individual who grew up with duplexes, I can tell the minister that the backyards are not very big--you cannot kick a football in them, you cannot play any footy in them, you are lucky if you can get the handball out and play up against a wall. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection because I am happy to enlighten those members and use the remaining 10 minutes I have available to me. This document was intended to provide certainty and we are finding that it does not. From the South East Queensland Regional Plan of course we have the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program--a document that hangs off the regional plan and was intended to provide certainty to the construction industry about future infrastructure plans of the Queensland government. Unfortunately, when we look at this plan, as we do with many things that Labor touches, we find that the projects are blowing out. We find that both in time and in cost the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program is no longer being considered something that is serious--again, another document that is losing credibility within the industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109642"></A>
One of the things we saw when the South East Queensland Regional Plan was released was that almost immediately there were accusations about favouring Labor mates. It is not something that should be taken lightly. Every time a plan is released, every time lines are drawn on a map, there are of course winners and losers. With any plan, there needs to be confidence that those decisions were made not as a favour to some mate and not because some developer contributed to the party’s funds; there needs to be a clear and transparent process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109646"></A>
There has been speculation that decisions about locating future growth in the urban footprint have been made because of the influence of Labor mates and lobbyists with close ties. This is from a government that time and time again says, ‘Look at us. We are above reproach--oops, except for that little incident. Please don’t look over there. We’ll try again and we’ll improve the next time.’ </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr GIBSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am absolutely happy to do that. Let us look at some of the other elements of the South East Queensland Regional Plan because we must have confidence in the assumptions that underpin this plan. I look to the ‘Natural hazards and climate change adaptation’ section in the plan. This is a plan that industry must look towards. What we find here relates to the assumptions that have underpinned this plan. When it comes to the issue of state coastal management, the plan is working towards a sea level rise of 0.8 metres by 2100. What is the basis for this decision? It is important that we have confidence in this. The plan makes it very clear. It says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1109658"></A>
... the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) projects a sea level rise range of 0.18 to 0.79 metres by 2100. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109659"></A>
So here we have the state government taking a more cautious view than the IPCC and moving it to 0.8. But what do we know about the IPCC? In the last few weeks, we know that its reports have not been peer reviewed. We have seen it with the glacial melting fiasco. We have seen it with its reports in South America. The IPCC is not a scientific advisory body. It is a body that is driven by political agenda. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109660"></A>
Indeed, I note that the most respected journal <Hansard-Italic>
Nature</Hansard-Italic>
 has indicated that leading scientists are now stepping up calls for a major overhaul of the IPCC following a string of criticisms of its reports. It has said that calls are being made for the IPCC to draw on established peer review literature. Yet we find this government relying upon documents that now are of concern.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109661"></A>
There are other elements within this report that are also of concern. What is one of the great traits of Labor governments that we know of? We only have to look to our federal Labor government to see how this trait is almost embedded in its DNA. Labor governments are all about talk but not about action. I heard it best this morning in question time when we were challenging the government on the issue of homes, and it was all talk, no houses. </Hansard-Body>

What have we found from this Labor government in the South East Queensland Regional Plan when it comes to the Rural Futures Strategy? Section 5.1 of the plan indicates that the government will be establishing a structure to inform the implementation of the South East Queensland Regional Plan, which includes a small high-level implementation committee for the Rural Futures Strategy formed from stakeholders representative of the region’s industry sectors and communities. It sounds like a great idea. It was spoken about, yet has this committee been formed? The answer, I am advised, is no. I am advised that the Rural Futures Strategy committee has not been formed. I am told that they have not met. I am advised by those in the industry--</Hansard-Body>

 I have no reason to doubt. I take the interjection from the member for Everton. What we find from Labor members is that they want to play games. They do not want to talk about a committee not being formed, despite one being pulled together. So I would pose these questions to the minister and I seek his clarification in his summing-up. If the committee has been formed, who are the committee members, when did they last meet and what objectives have they agreed to discuss? We are hearing over and over again from those in the industry that the government has failed to properly consult and properly deal with the stakeholders.</Hansard-Body>

There are many other elements of the South East Queensland Regional Plan that deserve consideration and time. One such area involves the importance of green space, and the issue of infill makes that so much more important. Of course there is the issue of koalas, where we see the sustainability minister almost actively working against the South East Queensland Regional Plan, and that is of concern. There are issues with regard to regional landscape areas and management, natural resource management, social planning and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who are rightfully recognised within the plan. There are also other elements to do with water management, transport, urban character and design, and others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109672"></A>
In the remaining time that I have I wish again to reiterate that we must have confidence in a planning document. We find that this South East Queensland Regional Plan is the Peter Pan plan to growth. It is the Peter Pan plan to growth, because if you stop and think happy thoughts perhaps it will happen. So we have the minister here, like Peter Pan, thinking happy thoughts. If he can find that one happy thought, he will be able to fly and the plan will be delivered. Well, unfortunately, or fortunately, this is not a fairytale. This is not some children’s story. This is a document upon which Queenslanders, and in particular South-East Queenslanders, must have confidence. We must know that in moving forward the assumptions that underpin this document are those that will ensure security, certainty and flexibility for residents of South-East Queensland into the future. That being said, whilst we have severe reservations about elements of the plan, overall it is a good plan. It is one that we can support in principle and we will be doing so. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (8.47 pm): The LNP supports the South East Queensland Regional Plan concept, as it is necessary to have a good planning process in South-East Queensland, which is experiencing continued growth, as it has for the last 30 years. Growth is not new, it is ongoing but it has to be managed in the right way. We do, however, have reservations about the way this government is handling growth. Gordon Gekko famously claimed that greed was good in <Hansard-Italic>
Wall Street, </Hansard-Italic>
while in George Street the Bligh Labor government claims that density is good. Both of these extreme values are abhorrent to most Queenslanders, who do not want greedy, inept governments with visions of sardine cities. They want growth to be balanced with cost-effective and timely infrastructure and they want choices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109680"></A>
The answer to future growth is not just about high-rise and higher density, as the government would have us believe. There has to be a balance which gives people choices which the infill and density targets of this government fail to achieve. Where high-rise and higher density are justified in a number of urban centres, this has to be accompanied by a plan for infrastructure that underpins that and makes it sustainable. That is also true in other communities with reasonably lower density targets--suburbs, cities, regional communities. But there is no connection between the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program and the growth targets with the South East Queensland Regional Plan. There is no connection between SEQIPP, the infrastructure plan, and the South East Queensland Regional Plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116130"></A>
When projects are resequenced under SEQIPP, there are no announcements, no consultation and no consideration about what this means for the communities which are expected to expand without infrastructure such as hospitals, roads and public transport and other services. The only thing visionary about the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program is the fact that it is out there in the ether. It has no foundation, and it is nothing more than air and spin when you consider the huge gap between the infrastructure that is required and the growth targets of this government. It is a whim, it is a whiff, it is a nice idea. Like the South East Queensland Regional Plan, this infrastructure document is aspirational. It has lost connection to the growth targets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116135"></A>
In recent years we have seen an escalating estimated cost of what SEQIPP should be but no plan to deliver those projects in a timely way. SEQIPP has blown out in cost by 280 per cent since it was launched in 2005, from $32 billion to $124 billion, and the time lines are floating away onto the never-never. As I have said, there has been resequencing of SEQIPP, but there has been no explanation publicly about the resequencing and we have had to trawl through the documents. I will table one document that provides an analysis of the blow-outs, in cost and in time, of a number of these projects, but there is no connection with the resequencing and the growth targets of this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116138"></A>
A significant proportion of the projects which have been rolled back and which have blown out in price are in the Transport and Main Roads portfolios. These projects have grown from $25 billion to $95 billion on paper, and delivery times have been pushed further and further out. As my colleague the member for Gympie has outlined, the South East Queensland Regional Plan is predicated on the population growing from 2.8 million to 4.4 million people in this region, requiring an additional 754,000 new dwellings between 2006 and 2031. The increase in dwellings varies. In Ipswich it is 226 per cent; in the western councils it is 100 per cent; in Logan it is 78 per cent; on the Sunshine Coast it is 75 per cent; on the Gold Coast it is 71 per cent; in Toowoomba it is 68 per cent; in Moreton Bay it is 68 per cent; in Redland it is 42 per cent; and in Brisbane it is 39 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116140"></A>
Then there are the infill targets--targets which a lot of local governments have had foisted upon them and are having to cop the flak for. On the Sunshine Coast the redevelopment and infill targets are for 37,000 dwellings, or 38 per cent growth. With broadacre the targets are 61,000 dwellings, or 62 per cent growth. All together this is 98,000 additional dwellings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116142"></A>
What about the infrastructure required to meet this extraordinary amount of growth? What infrastructure? The Sunshine Coast regional hospital has been delayed yet again--delayed in a region of 300,000 people currently and a population that is due to explode. In fact, the government has rolled back the necessary infrastructure in a region where it is encouraging a fast-tracking of that explosion. The same is true with the CAMCOS corridor, which is fundamental to the future of the public transport needs of the Sunshine Coast. This, too, has been rolled back. This, too, has been pushed further and further into the future while growth along that corridor is being fast-tracked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116145"></A>
Premier Anna Bligh announced that residential development at Maroochydore, Meridan Plains, Palmview and Caloundra South would be fast-tracked in what she described as a bid to tackle spiralling housing affordability in South-East Queensland, but it is a case of a lot of talk and not a lot of action from the Premier in ensuring that growth is sustainable when it comes to infrastructure delivery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116148"></A>
What about the economic plan? This is fascinating. There is no economic plan that sits alongside and underpins the South East Queensland Regional Plan. </Hansard-Body>

Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hear the minister laugh. Well, table it. There is no economic plan that sits alongside and underpins the South East Queensland Regional Plan. The principal activity sectors in the SEQ Regional Plan are like dots on a map with no economic plans or alignment to infrastructure and services. They are principally pimples on a map rather than principal activity centres with meaning, because there is no focus of coordinated government activity. It is a bit like a scratchie: it promises a lot but does not deliver much once you get below the surface. Unfortunately, that is so true in regard to the fundamentals required to have a regional infrastructure plan that understands the economic fundamentals, because there is no plan to drive jobs growth sustainably in this region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116153"></A>
SEQIPP has become an aspirational rather than an operational document. I will table this because planning without infrastructure delivery is like steering a boat without a rudder. You will have a lovely journey drifting along, but the destination will not be the one that you intended. I believe and the LNP believes that South-East Queensland, where this growth is occurring, deserves better. It deserves more than just talk from this government. It deserves timely and cost-effective infrastructure delivery which meets the realistic needs of this area. I table this document.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (8.55 pm): The South East Queensland Regional Plan is full of promise about how the government is going to deliver its vision for Queensland’s future. It claims that its regional plan vision for South-East Queensland is for a future that is sustainable, affordable, prosperous, livable and resilient to climate change. Those are lovely motherhood words. Unfortunately, what the government promises is a glossy document full of spin. It is a long way from what is to be delivered for the people of South-East Queensland. Here is a government that has these wonderful visions for the future of South-East Queensland, but when it forces the development on South-East Queensland it will never meet those visions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116163"></A>
I will focus my comments tonight on how this plan is doomed to failure on the Sunshine Coast alone. I know that others will have plenty to say about other parts of South-East Queensland. When it comes to managing growth and development, infrastructure is the biggest challenge. This regional plan talks about giving priority to its development in infrastructure rich areas. The plan states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1116165"></A>
Development proposed without existing or planned infrastructure will have to demonstrate how infrastructure can be provided and funded prior to the development being approved.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116166"></A>
How does the government justify its obsession with fast-tracking development, particularly greenfield developments like those proposed for the Sunshine Coast, if it is genuinely committed to those infrastructure goals? Greenfield developments are not infrastructure rich. They do not have any infrastructure. In some instances they are proposed areas that were not even inside the urban footprint a few years ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116168"></A>
The South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program is supposed to set the priorities that will deliver the infrastructure needed for the regional plan. At a glance, the infrastructure program shows just how unrealistic those priorities are. Take CAMCOS, for example. CAMCOS is supposed to bring rail to the Sunshine Coast. According to the 2005 infrastructure plan, it should have commenced construction by now and at a total cost of $1 billion. The 2009 infrastructure plan does not show construction starting before 2014, with completion pushed out at least to 2026 and at a cost of well over $3 billion. Who knows how much further it will blow out in terms of timing and cost before it is finally delivered? Whatever your views on the need for heavy rail on the Sunshine Coast, the fact remains that the government has not even been able to start this major infrastructure project, yet it is consistently referred to as being critical to the transport strategies of the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116172"></A>
Alongside CAMCOS is the multimodal transport corridor, which will provide much needed upgrades to the existing road network. If we are talking about infrastructure that will cater for growth, the multimodal transport corridor is an essential component. Now these two projects have been combined with CoastConnect, which will provide for more effective public transport movement on the coastal strip. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122657"></A>
If the government is trying to deliver a good regional plan, it has to deliver the key infrastructure in a timely manner. This government is forcing development at all costs but is failing on infrastructure. The roads and transport projects I have just referred to are essential to another infrastructure project promised by this government--that is, the new public hospital in Kawana. This is to be the region’s major hospital, including the key emergency centre for the region, and it will rely on CAMCOS and the multimodal transport corridor to get people there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122661"></A>
The hospital is another example of this government’s failure to deliver. This public hospital was due to be completed in 2014. Now the government says it will be completed in 2016. Too bad that the road network and CAMCOS are not likely to be available then. But we have no guarantee about the public hospital being delivered either. This is not good enough, especially when the government is promoting growth at all costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122662"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan also makes claim to strong healthy communities that have access to a full range of services and facilities. A healthy community needs access to hospital beds. Hundreds of Sunshine Coast people are forced to travel to Brisbane because there are not enough hospital beds in our own community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122664"></A>
The Bruce Highway is a critical part of the infrastructure picture. The Caloundra to Sippy Downs section including the interchange must be upgraded to meet the growth envisaged in the regional plan. But that is not even on the radar for this government. It is not in the current five-year plan and critical funding has not been sought from the federal government. If the Sunshine Coast does not have the infrastructure to meet the current needs, how will it cope with the 80,000 or more new residents the government wants to force on the proposed greenfield developments alone? On the one hand the government presents us with a regional plan that bears no relationship to reality. On the other hand it is demanding fast-tracked developments. How is this consistent with its supposed vision? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122666"></A>
The Premier is planning a population summit to help her work out how to manage population growth. What a shame she did not do the groundwork before we committed to this fast-tracked development. Instead of using the regional plan as its blueprint, this government continues to make ad hoc planning decisions that will have a huge impact on future generations. Fast-tracking greenfield development sites on the Sunshine Coast in the name of creating supposedly affordable housing has implications for the whole region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122669"></A>
It has cost the Sunshine Coast Regional Council three-quarters of a million dollars to pay for the additional planning work required to meet the state government’s deadline. Who will pay those costs? Not the state government, not the developer but all the ratepayers of the Sunshine Coast. Claiming that these greenfield development sites will create affordable housing is simply not true. Someone will have to pay for that infrastructure--not just those big ticket items I have mentioned but all the local roads, footpaths, the water and sewerage facilities, the community facilities and the list goes on. The costs to developers are passed straight on to the homebuyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122671"></A>
Then there is the impact on the existing communities. The South East Queensland Regional Plan places great stress on our quality of life. Lifestyle is certainly what brings people to the Sunshine Coast. Rushing new developments will not achieve that. What it will do is increase traffic congestion on existing road networks and overload local services and that will affect the whole community, not just the areas where the development is taking place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122674"></A>
If the government is serious about this regional plan, it will stop fast-tracking development and start delivering on the south-east’s infrastructure needs. To put it in simple terms that those in the government can understand, you are putting the cart before the horse. You really do not know how to drive the cart. It is about time you learnt about financial management and planning. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.03 pm): I am pleased to be able to speak in support of this motion that has been moved today that deals with a very major issue for South-East Queensland and the people of South-East Queensland. It is an issue that I and those on this side of the House have supported since its inception. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122679"></A>
The concept of a plan for South-East Queensland is an important one. It is important for a range of reasons. It will prevent uncontrolled urban sprawl which we were in pretty serious danger of having. There are cities of the world that manage much larger populations than Brisbane, for example, within much smaller areas. They do so often without huge numbers of high-rises and while maintaining a reasonable quality in their cities. Maintaining sprawl is an important objective and one that is supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122681"></A>
It put an end to speculative development applications in South-East Queensland--that is, somebody buying a big tract of land cheaply and doing whatever it took to get that rezoned to make a windfall profit and simply on-sell it. That was a widespread practice. Stopping that is a valuable contribution to the plan. It has provided certainty. Even though some developers may find it uncomfortable, they know exactly what they can and cannot put a development application in for. That is far better than the system we had before of grabbing tracts of land and hoping that they would win the jackpot. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122682"></A>
It gives certainty to residents that if they buy in regional landscape areas at least for the foreseeable future it will be preserved with that character and they will not get a subdivision application next door. Similarly, if they are in an area that is marked for high density they may not like it but they know that and they have some certainty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122683"></A>
As a concept, I am very supportive of it, as those on this side of the House have been. That is not to say that there are not issues that I would like to speak about. I think there are some areas where the government has failed and where it needs to do much better. There are some areas that are not necessarily failures of the government but are challenges for the government to cope with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122684"></A>
I will say a few words in relation to the western suburbs of Brisbane. My electorate comprises a fairly sizeable proportion of acreage area of the city of Brisbane. I have strongly and consistently advocated over the years that the urban footprint should not be developed in the outlying suburbs of Brisbane. The government seems to have accepted that argument. It has been extended. That certainly has the support of the residents in my electorate and certainly has my support. These are the outlying suburbs of Brisbane. They are very poorly serviced with infrastructure. Further urban footprint extension into the area is absolutely unsuitable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122686"></A>
The area of Moggill also highlights the two issues that people who live in South-East Queensland could be confronted with. Some people in my electorate--and most of them have acreages--are not allowed to subdivide anything at all. That is certainly the way most residents want it. It does impact on individuals. I have many older people in my electorate on two, five or 10 acres who want to cut off their home and stay in their home but sell off the remainder of the land as a single block. Of course these people are unable to do this under the plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122687"></A>
Those residents in the other part of my electorate which is in the urban footprint--notably Mount Crosby, Bellbowrie, Chapel Hill and Kenmore--have to grapple, as do many other residents, with increasing density, with infill development, smaller lots and the like. Overwhelmingly in the local area the issue is that of a lack of infrastructure. It comprises a significant proportion of what I have said in this House since I have been here and I am sure it will comprise a significant proportion of what I will say in this House subsequently. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122688"></A>
We completely lack any reasonable road infrastructure by anybody’s measure. Moggill Road would be an unacceptable road anywhere in Australia. It needs to be fixed. I speak on that subject regularly as I intend to continue. The Western Freeway is ultimately unacceptable state controlled road. We see in the urban plan that the growth corridor is in the west. It is connected to Brisbane by the Western Freeway, an already hopelessly inadequate road. It cannot remain that way. If it does, this plan is doomed to failure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122689"></A>
The Brisbane City Council is attempting to do something about the most horrendous bottleneck I have ever seen, the Toowong roundabout, by putting in a tunnel. If that is done in the absence of a major improvement to the Western Freeway, the bottleneck will move from the Toowong roundabout to the Western Freeway, which is an inadequate road. It was in trouble again this week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129111"></A>
The western corridor needs particular attention because of the amount of growth that is being packed into it. To a significant extent--and it is not necessarily the fault of the government altogether but nevertheless it is a challenge for the government--the regional plan is about finding places in which to pack people, if I can put it in those terms. I see the government is not particularly helped by some of its own. Listening to ABC radio during the week, I heard the queen of the NIMBYs, Councillor Helen Abrahams from the Brisbane City Council, the lady who wants to take West End back to the 1950s. Her solution, appealing to the local NIMBYs in her area, is to send them all to Indooroopilly. That is what she said. She wants to pack them up from West End where a new bridge is being built, where people can walk or cycle to the city, where there are two pedestrian bridges on which we have spent tens of millions of dollars. She wants to pack up all of that and not develop West End but put it all out at Indooroopilly where there is a train that is already overcrowded and cannot take any more passengers and where there are utterly unworkable roads and where the Western Freeway is located, which does not work for anyone. If that is the way members of the Labor Party think, we are in a lot of trouble. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 She might be; I take that interjection. Interestingly for the council, while I have stood up in this place for the last six years fighting to try to get any sort of decent infrastructure for the western suburbs of Brisbane, I did not see Councillor Abrahams trying to get the Go Between Bridge to service her residents. Rather, she stood there and opposed it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129120"></A>
TODS--transport orientated developments--has become a catchcry in planning and I think that is a reasonable principle to have in the plan. However, the government cannot just assume that because a place has a railway station it is suddenly suitable for a lot of high-density and high-rise development. There needs to be better infrastructure than that. I speak particularly of Indooroopilly because it services the residents of my area. Before putting large quantities of population in transport orientated developments in Indooroopilly, which I have no doubt will occur, that area needs substantial upgrading to its very ordinary public transport services and its completely unacceptable road surfaces not to mention the social infrastructure such as schools, green space, parks and the like. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129122"></A>
The need for infrastructure to support this development does go beyond state government infrastructure alone--and it is good to see the minister over there listening. A lot of the infrastructure that will have to support this population is social infrastructure. Much of it is council infrastructure such as parks and libraries that will need to support it. Many of the council roads will need upgrading. In the area of education, for which I am pleased to have shadow ministerial responsibility, I encourage the minister to have a look at the South East Queensland Regional Plan. There is no plan for education in it. Where is the large array of new schools and educational institutions that this plan requires? The minister is looking through the book and I am very pleased to see it. There is nothing in there that is going to provide schools for over a million extra people. The minister can keep looking; this is a major failing. There is a number of places I am aware of that desperately need new schools even as we speak, let alone with that sort of population growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129124"></A>
Another area of challenge for the government is that of housing affordability. Circumstances as they are, we see that a huge premium is paid for property that is close to the city, and this will worsen. The end result is that people will live where they can afford to live. This is not new, but it is a challenge for the planning--and I am not necessarily blaming the government entirely for this. People will move to places such as the western corridor, Caboolture, Logan or some of the other areas where housing is a bit cheaper because that is where they can afford to live. However, they will still go to work where they can find a job and, by and large, that will not be local. The latest creation of jobs in South-East Queensland is, in fact, the TradeCoast, which will bring many of these new residents in the outer areas into Brisbane. There is a need for drastically improved links to these areas. I am not saying it to be clever; it is an observation that is very important. I support the plan and I am quite happy to be very strongly on the record, but it is an observation that is very important to get right if we are not to see a whole raft of other social problems forming. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129127"></A>
When we are looking at packing in a lot of people, the other area where the government is perhaps not as strong as it should be and I think needs to be looked at very closely is some sort of regional decentralisation policy, in particular, ensuring that some of these regional areas have as many employment prospects as is possible. Presently, the mechanism for providing this additional housing--the hundreds of thousands of additional houses that are required under the plan--whether the government likes it or not is market forces. The price of property needs to be sufficiently high to attract private developers--because the vast bulk of this property is going to be built by private developers--to develop property in the numbers that are required. If we look at building approvals at the moment, I suggest that we are probably falling short of the housing starts that we need to provide adequate housing. When the underlying supply of new housing approvals falls significantly--and I see the minister shaking his head; I urge him to look at the housing approval data--short of the number of new residents who are coming in and the underlying demand for houses, the prices rise. Basic economics tell us that the prices will rise until it creates significantly more development. </Hansard-Body>

What we do not want to see is too many people getting hurt in the process, particularly first home buyers and lower income earners. That could also include people who fall on hard times because of, for example, divorce or other circumstances who may lose a home and find it very difficult to get back into the housing market. These are the forces that we are relying on. They are being significantly exacerbated in this state because of what I spoke about earlier, which is the need to have infrastructure, both transport and social infrastructure. I speak particularly of some of the types of infrastructure provided by council such as roads, drainage, parks, libraries and even parking in some cases. The cost of much of that infrastructure, which in the past was borne by the general community to a more significant extent than it is now, is now being charged as fees to developers and that, therefore, flows directly on to the price of new properties. It is a significant contributing factor to the higher housing costs that are required before developers start to bring more product on stream. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135694"></A>
This is something that we have not addressed well and infrastructure charges--not just in the city of Brisbane but throughout all the local government areas, because a big burden has been imposed on local government because of the plan--have skyrocketed astronomically. Having recently been away and had a look at property in some other areas, I can say that Brisbane--and I have no doubt other places will head the same way--is becoming one of the very expensive places in the world in which to get into a home. </Hansard-Body>

 Australia in general, because of issues relating to housing affordability. A lot of us find it a little bit hard to understand why you can buy a property even in a place such as London at prices similar to what you can buy a property in Brisbane. As I have said before, I do not necessarily blame the government, but the government needs to be cognisant of this issue. A plan that restricts development--and rightly restricts development--will, however, inevitably lead to higher housing prices and we need to be prepared with a response, as far as is possible, to that issue. </Hansard-Body>

 West is absolutely right. I take that interjection from the member for Lockyer. Brisbane is expected to accommodate an additional 279,000 people. Ipswich is expected to accommodate an additional 292,000 people--more people than are expected to be accommodated in Brisbane. The Gold Coast is expected to accommodate an additional 82,000 people--again more people than are expected to be accommodated in Brisbane. Moreton Bay--that is the Caboolture-Redcliffe-Pine Rivers area--is expected to accommodate an additional 180,000 people. The Sunshine Coast is expected to accommodate an additional 202,000 people. The western councils around the area represented by the member for Lockyer are expected to accommodate an additional 80,000 people. The Logan area is expected to accommodate an additional 174,000 people. </Hansard-Body>

As a final comment, I am glad that we have moved from the days of speculative development applications, where people simply sat on a tract of land and hoped to win the jackpot by getting the local council, by hook or by crook, to rezone it. But instead of speculative development, we are in the area of big boy development. We have seen lobbyists such as Terry Mackenroth representing the Farm Fantastic property at Elimbah, because the only way these places can be included in any plan is by amendments going through parliament. So let us have an end to the influence of lobbyists in these matters. <Hansard-Speech-End>

One thing that I would like to mention to the minister--and I am sure that great planner, Mr Rowland, sitting in the corner there might be able to advise the minister--is the escarpment to the Toowoomba range. It runs around to Cunningham’s Gap. That area is not regarded in a different way in the regional plan. I think there is probably some room for better management of that area in conjunction with the local councils there. I am talking about that really steep section of land in terms of what we can do to reduce fire hazards. I am sure the members for Toowoomba North and Toowoomba South will agree with me that some management plans probably need to be put in place there. I will bring those matters to the attention of the minister as well at some stage. </Hansard-Body>

One thing that I think we must do in relation to these rural plans is to try to put more jobs in these outer areas. That seems to be the secret to stopping a lot of the problems. The villages used to be nearly self-sufficient prior to the advent of the motor vehicle. They had their own little industries. I know I am harking back through history, but these villages used to have clothing factories and all of that sort of thing that generated a lot of employment. I think that we have to start--</Hansard-Body>

 Yes, that is true.

As has been mentioned by previous speakers, I think infill is definitely a good idea. However, there has to be room made for common-sense ministerial management of this plan on an ongoing basis. I look forward to writing to the minister about some of the issues that I have raised. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Redcliffe--ALP) (9.27 pm): I rise to speak in support of the motion. The South East Queensland Regional Plan protects over 85 per cent of the region from urban development. The plan reflects the fact that a significant expansion of the urban footprint designation was not required to accommodate projected population growth in South-East Queensland. In a planning sense, the environment will be protected through three key policies, which are the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the preparation of the South East Queensland Climate Change Management Plan, the setting of regional targets for the required regional outcomes of the South East Queensland Regional Plan for environmental protection and planning schemes to reflect the framework for ecologically sustainable decision making.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms van LITSENBURG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In parallel with this, the South East Queensland Climate Change Management Plan is currently being developed and is expected to be released in mid-2010. The South East Queensland Regional Plan includes the introduction of provisions and targets to effectively provide for urban green space. This recognises the need to provide high-quality linked urban green space in new and infill urban areas, such as Redcliffe which is a large infill area, and in particular in regional activity centres and areas of higher density development. State agencies are working effectively together with local governments to integrate an agreed biodiversity mapping approach for the region, including methods to map and represent biodiversity networks for use in state, regional and local planning and management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144698"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan is closely linked to and supports the South East Queensland Natural Resource Management Plan, which includes targets to maintain or increase the area and extent of regional vegetation cover, habitat for priority species and wetlands; ensure no net fragmentation of large tracts of vegetation over 5,000 hectares; protect vulnerable ecosystems; and ensure no decline in the conservation status of native species. In addition to these measures, local government planning schemes will need to show how they reflect sustainability principles and how they will contribute to development that includes reduced energy use, well-situated open space and a well-protected system of wildlife habitats. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144699"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan specifically recognised that the decline of the region’s koala populations is of great concern. The solution to this problem lies in a strong, whole-of-government response, effective industry and community partnerships and, most importantly, long-term commitment. The Bligh government has committed to a koala response strategy to protect the South-East Queensland koala population, including a suite of planning and other implementation tools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144700"></A>
In the South East Queensland Regional Plan, proposed new koala habitat offset provisions are referred to. These will allow contributions from developers to be used to fund the acquisition of koala bushland and the rehabilitation of potential koala bushland habitat areas. The offset provisions will be established through a new state planning policy to be released in mid-2010. The regulatory maps within the South East Queensland Regional Plan regulatory provisions have been reviewed, taking into consideration the latest information on koala habitat and submissions relating to koala protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144701"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan has strengthened the requirement to protect and enhance koala habitat and offset development impacts, committing to the achievement of a net gain in koala habitat in 2010. An example of this is reducing the urban footprint boundary in Redland City, boosting the land available for koala habitat and rehabilitation. An area of 4,584 hectares at Thornlands has been removed from the urban footprint in the South East Queensland Regional Plan. The previously identified Southern Redland Bay Investigation Area has also been deleted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144702"></A>
In my own electorate of Redcliffe, I have been working with a committee of environmentalists and conservationists from across the Moreton Bay region and with a cross-departmental reference group to develop a 10-year plan for the management of Hays Inlet, Saltwater Creek and the development of a wildlife corridor up the Pine River to Kurwongbah. This is to ensure that the development taking place in these regions supports the continuation of pristine waterways flowing into Moreton Bay and that the wetlands surrounding these waterways are kept pristine and enable wildlife to thrive there. It is vital for the long-term sustainability of our native wildlife, such as a family group of koalas, that in times of drought or disaster they can move along the corridor to safer areas that have food reserves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144703"></A>
Redcliffe has huge natural environments and we are looking to become a tourist destination. It is vital that we maintain our iconic wildlife, natural environments and pristine bay if we are to use our natural environments for tourism, because these are what people want to experience. These are our heritage as Queenslanders and as Australians. As the multilevel apartment replaces the three-bedroom house on the quarter-acre block, it will become more vital that Queenslanders have access to public natural environments and wildlife close enough to their dwellings for them to visit and enjoy on a regular basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144704"></A>
Since the release of the South East Queensland Regional Plan, draft planning instruments have been prepared and are currently on public notification until the end of February 2010. These instruments will seek to manage the effects of development within existing and potential koala habitat areas. Additional actions being undertaken by the government to protect the koala population in the region include an acquisition and rehabilitation strategy, koala crossings for main roads and model dog-control laws. The new koala planning instruments implement the policies contained in the South East Queensland Regional Plan. The koala conservation policies were developed in consultation with the Department of Environment and Resource Management and in response to the Premier’s koala task force recommendations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144705"></A>
I am confident that we are on track to deliver a more comprehensive strategy for koala conservation that will achieve good outcomes for South-East Queensland koala populations and serve the needs of the South-East Queensland region. I thank the minister for his vision in implementing this plan and supporting provisions. I commend the South East Queensland Regional Plan and supporting state planning regulatory provisions to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
The greatest challenge facing Brisbane in the decades ahead is preserving the livability of our city in the face of growth. That people continue to want to flock to Brisbane is testament to its attractiveness as a place to live, to raise families, to make a home and work. But we risk being loved to death. Those elements that attract people, including our clean, green environment with open space and character housing, are being placed at risk. My community in the Indooroopilly electorate expects good planning that allows appropriate development in consultation with locals. However, the state government appears intent on only one thing: squeezing more and more people into Brisbane.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144739"></A>
The number of additional people the state government wants in Brisbane is staggering. The state government is demanding that there be an extra 156,000 dwellings in Brisbane by 2031. That is an increase of almost 40 per cent on what we have now. And it has ordered the Brisbane City Council to find spaces for this 40 per cent increase. It did not give the council any choice. The state government was not satisfied with a 20 per cent increase. It was not satisfied with a 30 per cent increase. It ordered the council, it demanded the council, it mandated the council, to find a 40 per cent increase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144743"></A>
I believe this 40 per cent increase is unrealistic. I believe it is too high. I believe it places at risk Brisbane’s livability. But the state government continues to demand this 40 per cent increase and impose this increase on the local council. Now the state government wants to go even further. The state government wants to allow a free-for-all on duplex developments where two houses are built on the same block. It wants to do away with the normal building development applications for such developments. The duplexes would not have to pass the normal town planning processes and would be self-assessable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144746"></A>
The minister says he wants to ‘fast-track’ these developments. He wants to make it ‘easier’ to see duplex developments spread across Brisbane’s suburbs. What the minister really wants to do is fast-track the loss of character housing in our suburbs and make it easier to use up valuable and irreplaceable green space. We have already seen this state government repeatedly ignore and dismiss concerns about the impact of its plans on my Indooroopilly electorate. Let me give three examples. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144747"></A>
Despite demanding higher density developments, the state government has refused to guarantee that valuable green space that it already owns in the Indooroopilly electorate is preserved to offset that higher density. The DPI facilities at Meiers Road at Long Pocket and the Alan Fletcher Research Station at Magazine Street, Sherwood, are both earmarked to move to the new bioscience precinct at Dutton Park next year. This provides a tremendous opportunity to preserve this 11-hectare site at Long Pocket and this six-hectare site at Sherwood as green space. However, the state government has refused to rule out allowing this land to be converted to higher density development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144753"></A>
Let me give another example from my electorate. More people also means more pressure on infrastructure, including our schools. We should ensure that local children can go to their local schools. Over the past year I have spoken to many parents and staff from state schools in my electorate. They have repeatedly told me of concerns about pressure on existing class sizes as more people move into the area, especially with increased housing developments, more town houses and split blocks. The minister’s latest plans regarding duplex developments will only add to their concerns, because these parents and staff have already been shocked to hear the Bligh government’s view on demand for school places in the area. When I questioned the education minister about ensuring that local kids can go to their local school, he claimed that student numbers in the Indooroopilly electorate have not increased. The minister claimed that, while there had been a significant rise in the number of homes, those moving into the area had not been families with young children. Well, that was news to those many new families who have moved into my electorate. That was news to the school principals, battling to ensure that there are sufficient places to meet demand for those young children from those families. That was news to teachers watching class sizes rise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144755"></A>
The state government is clearly ignoring the reality of schools in the Indooroopilly electorate today. If it cannot deal with the issues of today, how will it cope with the growth challenges of the future? Yet it is demanding a 40 per cent increase in the number of homes. More people and higher density does not just put pressure on our local schools. It also puts more pressure on our public transport and roads. But this government has banned any additional park-and-ride spaces at the five train stations in my electorate. Encouraging people to use public transport helps ease the increased traffic congestion that inevitably comes from higher density. But this government, which wants a 40 per cent increase in density, also wants to restrict the use of park-and-ride spaces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144757"></A>
As for one of the most notorious traffic bottlenecks in my electorate--the Walter Taylor Bridge, which is a regular nightmare for residents of Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood, Corinda and Tennyson--what will the state government do about the added pressure on the bridge created by its demands for a 40 per cent increase in density? When I asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning what plans he had to deal with this issue, his only response was to say, ‘Well that’s a problem for the Brisbane City Council.’ So, while the Bligh government wants to squeeze more people into Brisbane and pack more people into my electorate, it does not feel any responsibility for the consequences on traffic congestion from those additional residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144763"></A>
As I said, the Indooroopilly electorate community expects good planning that allows appropriate development in consultation with locals. However, the state government appears intent on only one thing--squeezing more and more people into Brisbane. I support a regional plan, but I have serious reservations about this plan and the state government’s demands for a 40 per cent increase. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144770"></A>
I am privileged to rise to speak again on behalf of my electorate of Noosa in this critical debate about our future. My community always worries when Labor starts to plan on our behalf. The forced council amalgamation process of 2006 and 2007 was hallmarked by stripping Noosa and the Queensland constituency of the right to a binding vote on council amalgamations as enshrined in state law. Do you know why, Mr Deputy Speaker? It was because the Labor government knew that a vote would be defeated not by a small margin but overwhelmingly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144772"></A>
We on this side of the House support the planning processes which would, in normal circumstances, lead to the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009-2031, but these are not normal circumstances. We know that all of the submissions in the world make no difference to this Labor government’s approach to consultation. We know that all the wisdom subscribed by the Sunshine Coast Regional Council; the highly respected Sunshine Coast Environment Council; the influential OSCAR, which stands for Organisation Sunshine Coast Associations of Residents; the forensic Development Watch; the EDV Residents Group; as well as the wise council from the Noosa Parks Association, the Noosa Residents and Ratepayers Association and of course the Friends of Noosa, to mention but a few, simply fail to be taken into account by this minister and this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144783"></A>
How could we expect anything to be different? With a Labor government now more dependent for its political survival on donations from the property development industry than from its traditional labour trade union base and with a minister captive to that same industry for whom he was a consultant and advocate before coming into this place, how could we expect other than what we have got? But the minister monsters any notion of impartiality through the concept of investigation areas and sleight of hand expansions of the urban footprint to appease his constituent urban development lobby. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1144786"></A>
The Sunshine Coast Regional Council opposed the 1,408-hectare Caloundra South extension investigation area on the basis of the loss of the interurban break and the nutrient and recreational use impacts on the Pumicestone Passage. Others opposed other inclusions into the urban footprint as well, but still on he ploughs. But everyone was unanimous in their chorus for the permanent protection of the interurban break between the Moreton Bay area and the Sunshine Coast, for it to be set in concrete, to become an article of faith. This interurban break is prone to flooding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144790"></A>
There simply must be a ban on the continued development of flood prone or flood plain land. The current practice of raising the level of flood plain land above the flood level for development purposes simply makes flooding elsewhere more likely and more severe. It is a ‘beggar my neighbour’ policy. On the Sunshine Coast we do not want to see the incremental stripping away of the interurban breaks, as has occurred between Brisbane and the Gold Coast which is an interurban break in name only. I strongly oppose this minister having the power to gazette new growth areas without public consultation and the process for declarations to occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158262"></A>
These regulations will permit a wide range of urban style tourist, recreation, sporting, hospitality and commercial developments to occur outside the urban footprint with limited code and impact assessment requirements and little guidance for local government. Further, I am also totally opposed to the proposed discretion for the minister to declare urban and future growth areas as a master plan area. Given the current minister’s strong links to the property development industry, I am greatly alarmed by this proposed power, unfettered by any guidelines or ability to be challenged. This has been fostered by changing the definitions in the dictionary. Long-held definitions have turned turtle. What was forbidden is now at the bidding of the minister. Everyone has to go back to school and learn a new language. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1158265"></A>
My constituency and their advocacy groups requested the state support regional and local planning based on sustainable carrying capacity which also considers and accepts character and amenity. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council has a powerful electoral mandate for such planning and should be permitted to fulfil that mandate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158268"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan proposes 156,000 extra dwellings by 2031, a 39 per cent increase over the 397,000 of 2006. The plan envisages 497,000 people crammed into a sardine city by 2031, 68 per cent more than the 295,000 of 2006. The place we call home and love so much will be loved to death by such an onslaught. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council sought assurance that dwelling allocations be qualified by assessment of development planning constraints--constraints extended by the Sunshine Coast Environment Council and others, all to no avail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158270"></A>
The growth is uneven. Although the South-East Queensland population growth is 1.57 million, Brisbane will grow by some 39 per cent, the Gold Coast will grow by 68 per cent and the heaviest impact will be borne by the Sunshine Coast, with a 76 per cent growth in population. Analysis of state and regional population progressions to 2031 and 2050 clearly shows that these are not sustainable in ecological, economic, financial or social terms. With the population doubling every 25 years and with two-thirds of the population in South-East Queensland, one-third in regional coastal areas and only one per cent west of the ranges, South-East Queensland will have a population equal to the present total state population by 2031 and 20 per cent of that population will be over the age of 65. The state already spends twice as much per capita on infrastructure as the other states and is facing mounting budget deficits and a state debt with a lowered credit rating. It just does not add up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158272"></A>
Here is a case for a state and regional population and settlement policy and strategy. Analysis of the drivers of population growth, which is natural increase, net interstate migration and net international migration, shows that the state has a number of policy instruments at its disposal to deliver a population and growth rate which is determined to be sustainable for the region and for the state overall. Managing international migration to Queensland is obvious, given this has been double the rate of interstate migration in the most recent decade.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158274"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan simply accepts population growth as a fact to be accommodated rather than managed. Strategies and then policies need to be developed and implemented by which growth is limited to no more than the sustainable carrying capacity of the Sunshine Coast. A key factor of sustainability in my view is provision of acceptable infrastructure proceeding or in conjunction with appropriate development. I believe that the current government policy encourages this excessive population growth, and therefore policy change can reduce it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158275"></A>
For example, concessional stamp duty for first home buyers in Queensland is a significant incentive for Victorian and New South Wales property owners to relocate to Queensland, particularly in retirement, rather than to relocate within their own state. Limiting the concession to first home buyers generally rather than first home buyers in Queensland, as now, would be a good first step in limiting growth and would send a clear message of intent that population growth for Queensland is not limitless. It should be noted here that the Sunshine Coast Regional Council was elected almost two years ago with an overwhelming mandate from electors to preserve their quality of life, to nurture the area’s unique communities, to manage population growth and development and to make the region the most sustainable in Australia. The electors who live on the Sunshine Coast have sent this very clear message which should be informing planning and planning instruments such as the South East Queensland Regional Plan that replicating the Gold Coast on the Sunshine Coast is not acceptable to us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158277"></A>
There is here potential for a clear identification of community areas in which modelling of desirable future living could be trialled. I envisage the greater Noosa area as one which could be home to communities capable of ready adaption to important change. Booking the ClimateSmart Home Service--which is a state government initiative and which I wholly approve of--managing our carbon footprint, insulating our homes, installing hot-water systems and solar power generation, composting and recycling more of our waste, installing greywater systems and harvesting rainwater et cetera are a few examples of some of the myriad ways in which a small engaged community might model solutions to climate change and sustainability. These solutions might then be rolled out across the state when it is clear which approaches work best and how they might be implemented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158278"></A>
We residents of the Sunshine Coast advocate a much less intensive residential development for our area than the currently accepted urban norm of large estate development which requires water and energy to be captured or generated remotely and delivered to these developments and from which waste water and waste is transported to a remote site for treatment or disposal. The current urban model is ultimately unsustainable and undesirable. Greater Noosa, with recognition from UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Program, is, I submit, ideally and best placed to model a sustainable future. </Hansard-Body>

The truly monstrous failure of the Labor government has been in the provision of infrastructure. With our bankcard maxed out, the capacity for future generations to work through the economic catastrophe facing the state--home-grown by sheer economic incompetence--is hamstrung. Both the plan and the South-East Queensland infrastructure program fail to commit to the provision of the necessary infrastructure to support proposed increases in dwellings and sustainable development. The teaching hospital for the University of the Sunshine Coast--a truly fantastic win-win concept for health services in my region, for infrastructure provision and for education as a hub for economic development--has been put off and put back until it is almost out of sight and out of mind. Why? Because the Labor government has given up even the faintest hope of ever winning a seat on the Sunshine Coast so those electors do not matter anymore to Labor. The Queenslanders in this region of the south-east know who they cannot count on. Redress the wrong, address increases in public and active transport spending, and bring forward as a matter of urgency the coast section of CAMCOS and CoastConnect. </Hansard-Body>

Many rural communities are home to those engaged in lower paid employment who are compelled to travel to work, often shiftwork, by private car. Alternative transport modes must be made available for these workers. It is not acceptable that bulk public transport solutions be provided only in the most heavily populated areas which are already advantaged by a wider range of services under competitive provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158284"></A>
There are other infrastructure failures which I will only touch on. Education has failed. Schools are being built under a public-private partnership in my region. I am attending the opening of Peregian Springs tomorrow morning at 9.30, which in time will really max out the already maxed out bankcard. Health services fail every day. This is not the fault of the health professionals who struggle to meet the needs of those for whom they care; there are just too many of them to care for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158285"></A>
Then there is water. What do Sunshine Coast residents see? They see paddock after paddock of enormous black pipes just waiting to be laid to suck the lifeblood from the region. Water will leave from where it was harvested via one-way pumps through the infamous water grid, off to Brisbane never to be seen again and for which the reward of recompense has been harvested by this broke Labor government also. </Hansard-Body>

To most constituents, ‘infill development’ are dirty words but not everyone agrees. Displaying great courage and foresight, the Sunshine Coast Environment Council, for example, has proposed to focus on infill development to take advantage of existing infrastructure and services and the achievement of a more compact urban form incorporating sustainability principles. But this demands that location, scale and design must be sympathetic to the surrounding area and to community aspirations. In short, the local community needs to be engaged in the local solution. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1158322"></A>
The Labor government’s approach to planning did not even start from an informed position. There was no review of the performance of the previous plan despite the fact that the 2008 <Hansard-Italic>
State of the region</Hansard-Italic>
 report showed declining trends in almost all sustainability indicators, most noticeably biodiversity and livability indicators, and many of the plans and strategies that the plan requires for implementation are still incomplete and not integrated. While growth, transport and climate change are acknowledged, no robust solutions are offered. It is almost as if they have conceded that they will not be around long enough to address these problems of their own making, but they do not effectively address or provide solutions to these issues. Finalisation of this plan should await a fundamental review of the carrying capacity of the region. The dreadful lag in infrastructure and services has caught up with even the existing population, and effective performance monitoring, review, resourcing and accountability structures are incorporated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158326"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan will be informed by, and is subservient to, the Integrated Planning Act 1997 and the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Accordingly, it is of particular concern that the act does not include a prohibition on development applications which conflict with local planning schemes. This deficiency requires any local council to assess an application despite the conflict. Consideration of such applications makes it very clear to the local community that their faith in the local planning scheme, developed following prolonged community consultation, is misplaced. It also highlights for them the significant waste of local rate revenues applied by council to the assessment process and the dilemma which councils face in defending their decision in the Planning and Environment Court should a developer appeal against a refusal. It is essential that this wasteful, resource intensive and unnecessary activity is made redundant by appropriate amendment to the act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158329"></A>
While we humans can speak for ourselves, it is also incumbent to protect those who cannot defend themselves, and I speak particularly of the koala--our native icon--threatened with extinction by development, by this Labor government and by this plan in particular. The koala is a key indicator for biodiversity. They will be a lost indicator at the present rate as community groups struggle to offset the failures of this Labor government. The mapping program is inadequate, incomplete and slow, while another aspect of growth is seen with this minister--that is, the growth in loopholes to aid and abet the developer constituency to find legal ways to destroy koala habitat with impunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158331"></A>
Another aspect that has been largely overlooked is the impact on food production from development. Productive land agricultural pursuits, particularly those close to major urban centres, need to be preserved. This is another failure of the Traveston Crossing Dam--that less than optimum water storage location which sought to flood farm land and deprive Brisbane of a source of food. Let us hope that the remedial work to repair the damage done to the Mary Valley, primarily by the Premier in this case, will focus on developing this food bowl and repairing the other major consequence, which is social dislocation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158333"></A>
There is strong objection to the amendment proposed to the regional landscape and rural production areas, which has the effect of expanding the urban footprint and redefining activities which were previously urban. These areas should be afforded the highest level of protection possible so that food production for South-East Queensland’s increasing population can be secured and, simultaneously, natural conservation areas protected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

For the Sunshine Coast, we all hope for the sustenance of it being a community of communities. We do not want a sardine city. We want the places in which we live, work, play and grow our families to retain their uniqueness and their individuality. We want them to be the places in communities which attracted us to them in the first place. We do not want to morph into obscurity. We do not want to be harmonised. We want progress without oblivion. </Hansard-Body>

The vision for the future of South-East Queensland and the principles that underpin the plan are generally consistent with those supported and endorsed by Sunshine Coast constituents. However, one notes with concern that the plan and its regulated regulatory provisions have significant flaws which remain to be addressed. The major concerns remain the weak basis in the plan for determining how growth can be managed and the potential inconsistencies that arise between desired outcomes, the lack of infrastructure planning to underpin development and the powers to the minister, who always seems ready to do a stirling job on behalf of his developer mates. It does not bode well for a sustainable future for the Sunshine Coast or anywhere in South-East Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (10.05 pm): I rise to make a short contribution by commencing with my introduction and then proceeding for the balance of the time to discuss the regional plan. The plan is a document that impacts on the Sunshine Coast and, in large measure, on the seat of Caloundra, where large population areas of Beerwah, Caloundra South and parts of Palmwoods fall into the growth corridor. The government has continued to trumpet the population increase as being the basis for many of their initiatives and plans, but this government has often used population growth to explain away its mistakes, particularly in the Health portfolio where it claimed that the hospital building program and the EDs could not keep pace with population increases. It just astounds me that it is now claiming it can use the population for a plan, whereas in the past the population has defeated all their plans.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158342"></A>
I want to quickly talk about three issues. Firstly, I want to discuss what consultation was undertaken with the local community in relation to the South East Queensland Regional Plan. Secondly, I want to talk about the need for infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast. Thirdly, I will talk about the attitude of the local population to what is going to occur on the Sunshine Coast as they feel it is being destroyed as a tourism destination. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158344"></A>
Deeply concerning to the people of the Sunshine Coast is the lack of consultation in regard to the impact of the plan upon themselves. I can recall in this House that, in an early position the Premier held, she identified four areas of growth across the coast. For Caloundra South alone, its population in the commercial precinct is expected to be 50,000-plus in the next 20 to 40 years. What the government did not do was approach the residents of the Sunshine Coast and Caloundra and find out exactly what they wanted to happen on the Sunshine Coast in regard to their own community and their own environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158345"></A>
The lack of consultation is the clear hallmark of this government’s attitude as we have seen across a range of positions. It is the lack of consultation, that in-built arrogance that stems from a government that has been in place for too long, that has raised the concern and anger of residents. Secondly, in regard to infrastructure this government can certainly not claim any status of heroship on the Sunshine Coast. The CAMCOS rail corridor has been touched upon briefly tonight, but 2026 is a long time to wait given that the plan is 2031 for a rapid public transit system from Caloundra to Maroochydore. One can only imagine the government placing more and more buses on the road, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions across the Sunshine Coast between now and 2026. It is widely held that CAMCOS will be a line on the map before it will be a reality on the road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158347"></A>
I think the most intriguing point about the infrastructure is the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. It is a topic that I really love getting stuck into in the House, particularly when we understand that on 16 May 2005 the then Premier and health minister announced Sippy Downs as the site of a 450-bed hospital. At the time there was some doubt about whether that was 450 or 600, but we will leave the debate at 450. What astounded me was that in April 2009 the Queensland Health department produced a document titled <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast University Hospital Health Service Plan Summary Document, April 2009</Hansard-Italic>
. That document followed a second document, but the important point is that Queensland Health’s own document states at page 14--and the minister will be keen on this, because I know he is very keen on figures--that the total in-patient medical and surgical beds required by 2016-17 is not 450; it is 768. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165275"></A>
That is the figure from the government’s own document. This is the level of planning we have four years after it announced 450 beds for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. It had to go back and recalculate its own figures. Its own figures refute the initial bed-capacity requirement for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. Of course the government will say that that plan has been overridden and pushed to the side and that it has done more detailed analysis and come up with a second initiative of 450 beds. This initiative is only four years after the event. It went back and did this again. The government expects us to sit back and accept the South East Queensland Regional Plan as though it is the magic solution for all concerns across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165281"></A>
The third point I will make relates to crushing people into the Sunshine Coast region, and Caloundra in particular. This is going to destroy the sense and feel of Caloundra. Everybody knows that Caloundra is seen as a small coastal town or seaside village. One minister I know comes to the coast on a regular basis because he enjoys Caloundra. It is the sense of not being engaged by the government that makes the residents of Caloundra feel that they are losing something good. They are losing their local identity. They are losing their local community. There is an arrogance with this government that has been in power for too long. It will not even bother to engage with them to obtain their consent and point of view.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (10.11 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the South East Queensland Regional Plan, which purports to put in place a plan to cope with development, population growth and infrastructure to cater for the expected 61 per cent increase in population on the Gold Coast up to 2031. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Underpinning the SEQ Regional Plan is the SEQ Infrastructure Plan and Program. This document was intended to provide certainty to the construction industry about the future infrastructure plans of the Queensland government. Unfortunately, the intention of the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program has been lost as projects have consistently blown out both in time and in cost. The M1 between Nerang and Tugun is a perfect example of this. The M1 runs the entire length of my electorate, from Carrara to Robina on the east and from Worongary to Reedy Creek on the west. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165285"></A>
The department of main roads tells me that I am the most prolific letter writer of any of the members of parliament on the Gold Coast. My response to them is that that is because it is my biggest problem. The original time frame to begin construction for the eight-laning of the M1 from Nerang to Tugun commenced in 2005. We are still waiting for construction to begin. The time frame has now blown out to 2015.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165286"></A>
Let us examine this time line, shall we? Over and over again this government has reannounced, rehashed, rebadged and ripped off Gold Coasters with its incessant announcements which have caused massive blowouts in construction costs, such as the $7 million blowout for the notorious Nerang South interchange. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165287"></A>
The story unfolds at the start of January 2004, when $1.8 million of funding was announced for the infamous Nielsens Road by the then minister for main roads. In November 2004 a further $300 million was announced by the next minister for main roads for work between Tugun and the Gateway, with works to include widening the motorway to six lanes between Nerang and the Stewart Road intersection. At the same time, the interchanges at Loganlea Road, Nielsens Road, Somerset Road, Reedy Creek Road and Mudgeeraba were also to be upgraded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165288"></A>
In March 2005 former Premier Peter Beattie announced $530 million to six-lane the M1 from Tugun to Nerang. This announcement involved construction of a new off-ramp at Nielsens Road, but only after there had been a fatality at this junction of the M1. In June 2005 the then minister for main roads, Paul Lucas, announced another $940,000 for noise barriers on this new off-ramp at Nerang South. This had been built 18 months earlier and it took them 18 months to build those sound barriers by which time the Gold Coast City Council had built and extended Hinkler Drive, so the sound barriers were actually on the wrong side of the road. On top of that, a further $2.1 million for Nielsens Road was announced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165289"></A>
In October 2005 I was preselected as the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Mudgeeraba and immediately focused my attention on the infamous Nielsens Road intersection. Local Carrara and Highland Park residents to this day know me as the ‘girl on the roundabout’ at Alexander Drive as I protested on this intersection for almost a year from my preselection to the 2006 election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165290"></A>
After much publicity and the routine knocking down of a few homes on the intersection, timed for an election, a further announcement was made by the then minister for main roads, Paul Lucas, of $2.5 million for planning of a six-lane upgrade from Nerang to Currumbin. Having been narrowly defeated in the 2006 election, I commenced the Mudgeeraba Action Group and continued to campaign on this very same issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165291"></A>
With a marginal Labor member whom residents did not believe was voicing their concerns here in Brisbane, lo and behold we had another funding announcement in December of $5.7 million for planning of a six-lane upgrade from Nerang to Currumbin. Again this announcement was made by Paul Lucas. Guess what? Another house was knocked down, on the corner of Alexander Drive and Hinkler Drive. Again, this was met with scepticism by the locals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165292"></A>
Continued pressure on the government in June of 2007 saw the minister reannounce the same commitment to upgrade the Gateway to Tugun, but this time for $427 million. The state government has always falsely maintained that it could not upgrade any of the interchanges, which were state controlled roads, until the Howard government matched its funding. This line did not fool the locals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165293"></A>
In August 2007 the Howard government announced federal funding of $455 million for the upgrade from Logan to Tugun. Some of us in the House tonight, including the member for Gaven, were actually standing on the roundabout at Gooding Drive that day with Mark Vaile for this announcement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165295"></A>
Labor spin doctors announced that this was finally the matching federal funding that they had been waiting for for years and that this was a pork-barrelling election commitment by the Howard government. Those opposite know full well that this funding was in the 2007 federal budget brought down in May and that it was part of the AusLink mark 2 funding, which was never matching federal and state funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165296"></A>
Sadly, the Howard government was defeated in the 2007 election, but this did not stop the federal minister for roads, Anthony Albanese, from quickly reannouncing the same funding as a supposed matching election commitment. There is nothing like a Labor government to reinvent history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165297"></A>
I do hope that members are following this story so far because--guess what?--continued pressure led to another announcement in January 2008 and, you guessed it, some $45 million was announced to finally construct the long-awaited Nielsens Road interchange. This time we had a new minister for main roads, Warren Pitt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165298"></A>
What do members think happened next? Another house got knocked down but the interchange was finally commenced and has since been completed. This was a victory for people power--the Mudgeeraba Action Group and the long-suffering residents such as Stewie Elliott and Nathan and Lisa Lowe. The real victims of the Nielsens Road debacle, which blew out by over $7 million, was the Capon family. Brendan and Amanda were forced to pack up their family and move elsewhere. Whilst they were more than happy to see the interchange finally commence, they were not happy when the government tried to resume their property at $100,000 less than current market value. Are you shocked? So was the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165300"></A>
This tricky government tried to get away with resuming only a few metres of their home at market value and then planned to have sound barriers three metres from their bedroom window. This forced the value of their property down. In fact, it was unsaleable. Because it was not resuming the whole property, the price offered did not have to be at market value. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165301"></A>
Many thanks to Steven Ciobo MP, the federal member for Moncrieff, who fought side by side with me on this issue, and the Capons, who were finally given a sum of money much closer to market value than was previously offered. The local media certainly got behind this family and I dubbed them ‘The Castle’ because their home was their castle. When Amanda informed me of what the government was doing, I guess this would be the part of the speech where you could say, ‘Tell ’em they’re dreaming.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165302"></A>
In the meantime, the member who had completely ignored the northern end of the electorate, in Highland Park, started a petition to the federal government to fast-track the M1. An application to the feds for further road funding in the Rudd government’s promising-everything-and-building-nothing program was also unsuccessful. For me--and I had been campaigning full-time on road issues in the electorate since 2006--this pathetic petition, which gleaned a mere 800-odd signatures, was treated with the contempt it deserved by the federal minister. Gee, who do we blame now for not building the M1, seeing that the Labor government did not have Howard to blame anymore?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165303"></A>
I watched this unfold in the media with amusement. How was it that only 800-odd Mudgeeraba residents signed a petition for the former Labor member when over 1,500 residents in Highland Park alone signed Steven Ciobo’s and my postcard petition? Residents were not fooled by this too-little-too-late approach but, yet again, the Labor member got a get-out-of-jail-free card in the form of a state redistribution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165304"></A>
Finally, the buck could be passed for the last time to the poor residents of Highland Park, with the entire area and the infamous Neilsens Road-Alexander Drive interchange now firmly in the electorate of Gaven. Every political commentator knew that the Bligh government would call an early election, and my confirmation came with--yes, wait for it--another funding announcement for the M1 upgrade in December 2008. This time $158 million of state and federal funding was announced to--you guessed it--fast-track the widening of the sections of the Pacific Motorway--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Needless to say, we are still waiting for our interchange. However, there is something wrong with these figures. I clearly recall $910 million being announced in 2007 to eight-lane the M1 from Nerang to Stewart Road in Tugun. Now we have a mere $158 million and not eight lanes but only six. Now we are only six-laning six kilometres of road, which is going to take two years to construct, with a speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172124"></A>
So this is the Labor government’s idea of fast-tracking. This project was first announced in 2005. Now we are only getting a quarter of the funding, a quarter of the distance of road constructed and two fewer lanes which will not be finished until 2012. At this rate, my colleague the member for Currumbin will be still waiting for her stretch in about 21 years time. To further add to the confusion, the latest update on the Main Roads website says that they are traffic-modelling this upgrade until 2026. I think they need to be looking at modelling under this government until 2033. Now it states--this is the get-out-of-jail-free card--that this will involve widening the motorway to six or eight lanes and upgrading interchanges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172126"></A>
It is interesting to see that this Labor government, which has spent the last five years ripping off the residents of the Gold Coast, which has left us stuck in traffic in the ‘Mudgeeraba car park’, which has blamed every government but itself for its failure to build and which is busy rewriting history, as members of the LNP watched the Deputy Premier and the federal minister for roads do when they retold the story of the Tugun bypass only a few weeks ago at the opening of the Gold Coast Airport, is still covering its bases so that it can rewrite the story all over again in the ensuing years. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (10.21 pm): I and the LNP support the concept and the intent of the South East Queensland Regional Plan and the broader planning framework. The framework it establishes and the goals it sets out to achieve are sensible and necessary. As I see it, the plan is about managing population growth, identifying and delivering infrastructure, supporting ongoing local food production, setting aside green space for recreational and environmental purposes and investing in industry and employment. In a fast-growing corridor such as South-East Queensland such goals are vital. They will enable us to protect the lifestyle we enjoy to enhance the livability of our cities and towns whilst not closing the door on natural population growth and domestic and international migration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172132"></A>
There are many positives about the overall planning framework, the principles and guidelines within the South East Queensland Regional Plan. However, there is one glaring negative: this government’s botched implementation of that framework, those principles and guidelines. I have on numerous occasions informed this House of the consequences of this abysmal implementation. I have listed example after example of Glass House constituents disastrously affected by what can only be described as these mind-boggling decisions. I have talked to the Webbs of Woombye whose property meets all the guidelines for addition but whose submission was rejected. I have spoken of how the one-size-fits-all approach has impacted on families such as the Anketells of Flaxton and the Martins of Beerwah. I have outlined the astonishing omission of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council supported submission including Stewart Skerman’s property at Beerwah. I have presented the unjustness of excluding a property surrounded by development and public transport infrastructure owned by the Horne family in the Glass House Mountains. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172140"></A>
I believe these examples compel the government to review how it makes its zoning decisions with regard to the regional plan. I believe the government must go further than just consultation; it must apply a level of scientific rigour to its assessments. After all, urban and regional planning is a science. At a minimum that scientific rigour must include ground truthing. I know that planners are taught these skills--at least they were 15 years ago. I know because I sat alongside planners as I undertook my studies in geomorphology, biogeography, GIS and remote sensing at the University of Queensland. The use of simple scientific processes will go a long way to not only get the decisions right but reassure the broader community of the objectivity of those decisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172142"></A>
The plan and its related documents fail South-East Queenslanders in other ways. I refer to page 12 of the plan and acknowledge also the links with the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program. Page 12 of the plan and SEQIPP in its entirety suggest that part of the framework is to ensure growth is complemented by infrastructure development. However, every Queenslander knows that this just has not happened. SEQIPP is failing. Project times and budgets are constantly delayed and project start dates are constantly shifted into the far distant future. Again, I have provided examples of this failure before, but let me mention just three again: the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, the D’Aguilar Highway and the north coast rail duplication. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172148"></A>
The consequences of such failures are plain to see. The construction industry is criticising the government because delays impact long-term corporate planning. The people of the north coast continue to rely on an overstretched health system, a health system that becomes more dangerous by the day. The people of the north coast continue to traverse overcrowded and unsafe roads. The people of the north coast continue to access inferior public transport options. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council goes toe to toe with the government over fast-tracking developments. Do you know what? I do not blame them. If this government wants the Sunshine Coast Regional Council to develop Caloundra South it must live up to the expectations it has set for itself in the South East Queensland Regional Plan and SEQIPP. If it cannot deliver what it has promised when it has promised at the cost it has promised, this government has no right to force a council to put its people at an unacceptable health risk and condemn them to gridlock on coast roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172153"></A>
The members opposite will use the excuse of population growth--excuses, excuses, excuses. I am sorry, but the people of Glass House are sick of hearing them, especially when they know they are just not true. The government had warning. I know it did. When I joined the Queensland Public Service back in 2000 it was not long before I personally received briefings from the Planning Information and Forecasting Unit and the Office of Economic and Statistical Research on anticipated population growth. What is more, the government was in a purple patch with regard to royalties and revenue. The government had the wherewithal to begin implementing its infrastructure plans but, no, instead it ignored the warnings from its own forecasting and statistical units, it frittered away the rivers of gold and it is still playing catch-up today. Stop the excuses and start delivering. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172156"></A>
As I conclude I again reiterate my support for the intent of the South East Queensland Regional Plan. However, I am disappointed that yet again this government demonstrates its ability to produce a glossy plan and, again, this government has failed Queenslanders through its inept implementation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (10.26 pm): The new long-term plan for South-East Queensland has recognised the important relationship between land use planning, job creation and meeting the growing needs of the community. The plan promotes balanced and diverse employment opportunities throughout the region by encouraging better strategic planning for the 11 local government areas. The plan clearly identifies where key employment and community based activities centres should occur across the region. The plan identifies new health, education and training areas such as the University of the Sunshine Coast, which will provide the focus for future business clusters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172159"></A>
Providing jobs close to people’s homes is an important principle included in the plan. Enterprise opportunity areas are also identified where business and industry will benefit from access to regional freight corridors in proximity to workers. The plan strategically directs growth to relieve some of the pressure of the coastal cities and to make the most of opportunities that exist along the western corridor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172160"></A>
But even then it is wrong to assume that this means the end of tin and timber houses along the western corridor. These types of residential properties are part of the character of the region and are integral in upholding the unique characteristics of the region. I find it incongruous that in recent media statements the Lord Mayor said, ‘I want to protect the tin and timber homes, the old Queenslanders, from the widespread construction and out-of-control development,’ when referring to duplexes. Why then does he not care about the tin and timber homes in the Corinda area that residents own in relation to the Brisbane City Council’s draft Sherwood/Graceville Neighbourhood Plan, which has been in the making since 2007? This plan seems to be emanating from the views of planners in council rather than the views of local residents in Corinda and Sherwood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172162"></A>
All of the meetings that I have attended with these residents have been overwhelming against the proposal for five-storey developments in those areas. To justify its perceived need for high-density multiple-storey development, Brisbane City Council says it is being forced to do this through the state government’s South-East Queensland plan. There is nothing in the South-East Queensland plan which specifies high-density five-storey buildings to be constructed in Corinda or Sherwood. In fact, the South-East Queensland plan policies recommend that high-density development occurs in areas that are along key corridors that are rich in social infrastructure and services for the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172199"></A>
Neither does the argument wash with the residents that the council is being compelled to plan for high-density development because of population growth and to meet SEQ plan targets. Under the SEQ plan, there are no specific population target requirements for the Sherwood-Graceville Neighbourhood Plan area. The council has chosen this area to make up its targets and for not putting population growth in other more appropriate, more politically sensitive areas. This claimed target has been a personal choice by the council to allocate population targets into this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172200"></A>
The council frequently encourages communities to have their say in shaping Brisbane, but the evidence suggests that the reality is that it simply ignores the views of the local community and what the community has to say about their neighbourhood. The residents are not opposed to growth--they want it to come--but they want it to be a reflection of the character of their neighbourhood. The council simply disregards the view that there is substantial opposition from the local community to five-storey developments but a general acceptance of the current three-storey dwellings which have only a minimal impact on the old-style tin and timber character of the area. The council disregards the fact that Corinda and Sherwood are not as rich in infrastructure or services as other inner-city suburbs such as Indooroopilly, Toowong and Milton.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172201"></A>
As the local member, I know that the capacity of the main thoroughfare, Oxley Road, is now at its limit and is subject to unsafe congestion at peak times and during school pick-up and drop-off times. I am sure the member for Indooroopilly would be well aware of how congested the road is, but still he opposes the proposed ambulance station in the Graceville-Chelmer area, which will also easily service my areas of Sherwood, Corinda and Oxley. Everyone knows that there is little ability to widen the road to allow additional access for fire, ambulance or Police Service vehicles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172202"></A>
Substantial population increases also requires the council to plan not just for housing but also for the social demands. I am not satisfied that the council has considered the capacity of the local schools in the area to accommodate more children, nor am I convinced that it has planned for more parks and recreational facilities to support the proposed growth of the area. Under the current conditions in these suburbs, any substantial population increase in this area resulting from such high-density development would not be sustained. Local schools are now at their peak and have no further capacity for pupil population growth in the area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172203"></A>
I think the day will come when these suburbs will have to face dramatic changes in density to support population growth in South-East Queensland. But this, I presume, would be preceded by years of careful planning of appropriate infrastructure and services and I am not convinced that that has happened. I have continually sought an answer from the council as to why it wishes to see higher density in Corinda and Sherwood, but I am yet to receive a response that adequately addresses that question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172205"></A>
The South East Queensland Regional Plan provides the tools for the council to promote our lifestyle and better residential choices as well as provide attractive working environments that appeal to new businesses. The plan is strategic in identifying precincts that will support tomorrow’s economic growth and can accommodate a range of industrial, commercial and retail ventures without encroaching on well-established residential precincts. As previously mentioned, the plan provides strategic planning direction for councils to plan for their communities in the future. This plan does not preclude community engagement. In fact, we encourage communities across South-East Queensland, such as Sherwood and Corinda, to have their say about the future of South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172206"></A>
 The plan identifies that the South-East Queensland region will become home to more than 4.4 million people. Make no mistake, that is a lot of people. The state government is making sure that we have prepared the region for this growth in such a way that the lifestyle choices that we enjoy continue to exist well into the future. The future of the South-East Queensland region will see much more renewal of existing communities and the emergence of new communities than we have seen in the past. Controlling where urban development can occur over the next 20 years across the region is a key success factor of the regional plan. The plan also recognises the need to provide infrastructure and services to support economic development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172207"></A>
Economic development opportunities throughout the region have been identified and mapped out. This plan is the blueprint for sustainable development and managing the expected growth in South-East Queensland for the next two decades. South-East Queenslanders have made it very clear that they want their open spaces protected, not plundered, which is why the plan will protect 85 per cent from urban development. At the end of the day, the SEQ Regional Plan will redirect growth to existing urban areas while maintaining a supply of broadacre land for development. I commend the plan to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (10.44 pm):  I rise tonight to talk about an area of my electorate that has long been neglected. Last Wednesday evening I hosted a community forum for the residents of Reedy Creek in response to glaring neglect from eight years of Labor incumbency. Issues tabled for discussion were policing, TransLink and bus timetables, the M1 and Exit 85 interchange upgrade and the upgrade of powerlines in Reedy Creek. This was the first community forum I had convened and hosted, and the number of people who attended exceeded my expectation. Over 220 residents were there to listen and to have their say.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172256"></A>
This is how we in the LNP undertake community consultation. Sending out a glossy brochure in the mail is not good enough. This was the first time residents were given the chance of asking questions directly and putting their views forward on the issues that are having an impact on their daily lives. I would like to thank the following representatives for their time in attending and speaking: Senior Sergeant Mark Anderson from the Mudgeeraba Police Station; Peter O’Loughlin from the TransLink Transit Authority; Dale Jepson and Rosemary McBain from the Department of Main Roads; and Gary Madigan and Kenny Mizzi from Energex.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172257"></A>
It was made very clear by the residents that planning for the Exit 85 interchange upgrade did not take into consideration the traffic flow on the western side of the highway. Main Roads claim that this upgrade has been future modelled and will accommodate future growth for the next 20 years. This upgrade is already struggling with the large volume of traffic on the western side, cannot accommodate the current local traffic and will not sustain future growth in the next five years let alone the next 20 years. There are more housing developments being built and approved on the western side of the M1 with little thought being given to how road infrastructure will cope with this extra demand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172258"></A>
This upgrade needs urgent attention and review. In fact, I and the residents of Reedy Creek would go so far as to say that the plans should be ditched and further consultation called for, this time with real community involvement such as was seen last week at my forum. It is not rocket science. I am in the process of putting in place an action plan on all of the relevant issues and will convene a working group of Main Roads, TransLink, Gold Coast City Council, Stockland and myself to work on these issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172259"></A>
There is a genuine interest in setting up a residents action group, which I wholeheartedly endorse, which will also take shape over the next few weeks. I encourage residents to actively take part and, unlike the former member, I welcome their input and support so that we can get the services in Reedy Creek that we deserve. As editor Shane Watson said in this week’s edition of the <Hansard-Italic>

 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (10.46 pm): It was my pleasure to attend a number of local Australia Day events on Tuesday, 26 January this year. To start off the day I attended the Corinda Neighbourhood Watch breakfast at Nosworthy Park, Corinda, where many local residents gathered to enjoy a great Aussie barbecue. I commend President Scott Millis for sweating over the sausages and his Neighbourhood Watch team for making the event a success.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Then it was on to the inaugural citizenship ceremony at the Rocks Riverside Park organised by our busy Jindalee Rotary Club. Bernie Ripoll MP, federal member for Oxley, represented Senator Chris Evans, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Dr Chris Ho, a local orthodontist and corporate sponsor for the event, spoke about his journey to become an Australian citizen and about raising his family in Australia. Keith Hamilton, a member of the Rotary Club of Jindalee and the local chamber of commerce, spoke on the importance of tolerance, cooperation and goodwill. President Stephen Lazarakis and his Jindalee Rotary Club hosted the ceremony and celebration, which involved guest speakers from the local community. The local Rotary club members were on hand to provide information to the public and provide a great Aussie breakfast for all of the new citizens, followed by a family fun day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172264"></A>
The new Australians from the Philippines, Taiwan, South Africa, England, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and China were so proud to be receiving their certificates. Australia is a nation of immigrants from over 200 different cultures and we have greatly benefited as a result of this, both socially and economically, through jobs, business and quality of life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172265"></A>
Following the ceremony at Rocks Riverside Park, I was invited to participate in the Lions Club of Kuraby’s Australia Day citizenship ceremony at Runcorn State High School. Present also was Graham Perrett, federal member for Moreton, who presided over the ceremony. At Runcorn there were 89 new Australian citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172266"></A>
Becoming an Australian citizen means different things to different people. For most people, citizenship represents new opportunities, strengthening and formalising the commitment they have already made to this nation by choosing Australia, indeed Queensland, as their home. They all have their own personal stories on how their families, both past and present, came to call Australia home, not forgetting the original inhabitants and their relationship to this great land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172267"></A>
Multiculturalism brings social and economic benefits to all Queenslanders. Migrant families typically have a strong desire to do well in their adopted country and tend to go on to assist in the economic, social and cultural development. This is very evident here in Queensland, with migrants from all over the world successfully integrating and helping shape our great state. I congratulate all of those people in the community, such as the Neighbourhood Watch groups and the Rotary and Lions clubs, who place so much importance on the celebration of Australia Day and their welcoming spirit and pride for all who make the commitment to become citizens and to call Australia their home. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (10.49 pm): I was honoured recently to attend my very first Australia Day citizenship ceremony held in the Coomera electorate and hosted by the Helensvale Lions Club on Australia Day. I was especially honoured to welcome those who were taking the step to become an Australian citizen and calling the Gold Coast home--most of whom, I am proud to say, reside in the Coomera electorate. Indeed, the feedback I got was that there were about 65 people at that particular citizenship ceremony, which rivalled the main citizenship ceremony held at the council chambers. There were around 70 at that ceremony. So the numbers were very close. Of those 65, I am told that 63 lived in the Coomera electorate. One can imagine the pride that I have in welcoming all of those people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172305"></A>
This brings me to one of the issues that we are struggling with in the Coomera electorate--and that is infrastructure. The Coomera Town Centre is well and truly advanced now, and we can expect to see construction in the next 18 months to two years. But this is where the problems start. As the Coomera Town Centre is being built, we will be looking down the throat of massive amounts of material being brought in by trucks and so forth. We already have a major problem at exit 54, which is the main exit for the Coomera Town Centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172309"></A>
The problem is that there is a mismatch between the existing capacity of the road system from exit 54 to the Coomera Town Centre and surrounding area and what is needed even at this early stage over the next 18 months to two years. As far as Main Roads is concerned, it is not looking at doing anything for probably the next three to five years. That is where the mismatch is. I call on the Minister for Main Roads to have a serious look at what we can do to bring things forward in relation to exit 54. We really need to do something most urgently in that regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172313"></A>
Also, because Coomera Railway Station is the fifth station along the line from the Gold Coast, by the time the trains get to Coomera they are already overcrowded. In fact, it is the most overcrowded train line on the whole network. I call on the Minister for Transport to also work with us on the Gold Coast to boost the number of trains on that line so that we can get back to some reasonable level and reduce the overcrowding. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (10.52 pm): The Rocklea State School in my local area is a great local school. Turning 125 years old this year, the school has provided local children with their earliest formal education for a long time. Today the school’s population is, with a few exceptions, drawn primarily from the houses in the local suburb of Rocklea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172321"></A>
Situated in an area surrounded by industrial zones and the busy Ipswich Road and Brisbane urban corridor, the suburb is dissected by Oxley Creek, and it is this watercourse that has provided residents of Rocklea with some of their toughest challenges. Some of the houses in Rocklea are built on land that is in the one-in-two flood zone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172323"></A>
The current challenge in Rocklea, however, is declining enrolments in the local state school. Until this year, the school has been staffed by three teachers. This week the allocation has been reduced to two. Enrolment at the school on the day 8 cut-off fell clearly short of the numbers required for a third teacher, with 47 students enrolled. Sadly, this has resulted in the relocation of local legendary teacher Mrs Mac. Glenda McNamara has been educating children at Rocklea State School for 29 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172325"></A>
One can imagine the reach of Mrs Mac’s influence as she has worked with children and their families through nearly three decades. I know that some families have taken their kids to Rocklea so that they can be taught by Mrs Mac, the same teacher who taught their own mum or dad. So it is no surprise that the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 has featured this story on page 3, that a Facebook page was started by former students and that several of these former students emailed me to express their concerns. Mrs Mac is widely loved and respected. Tonight I thank her on behalf of the people of Rocklea for her commitment to local children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172326"></A>
I have visited the school and spoken with the principal and Mrs Mac, along with other members of the school community. I have also advocated to the regional director and to the minister the need to adequately resource this school given the impacts of its enrolment numbers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172327"></A>
I support the day 8 process of determining resource allocations to schools including the allocation of teaching numbers. The state must have a formula for allocating the more than 37,000 full-time equivalent teachers across more than 1,200 state schools. Schools must know their teaching allocations early in the year in order to settle students into classes and begin the delivery of educational programs. Having said this, I believe that the allocation of resources to Rocklea State School needs close examination. Whilst there are benefits of small schools--and many parents deliberately choose smaller schools--there can also be limitations on school activities that come with having a small number of teachers in a school. It is essential that resource allocation to this school be re-examined to ensure the best educational outcomes and extracurricular opportunities for the children of Rocklea. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP) (10.55 pm): I would like to speak about a school in my electorate, the Emu Creek State School. I received a phone call through the week from Brian Boyce, who is a friend of mine. He contacted me about the problems facing this school with the possible loss of a teacher. When this happens it is very sad for the school. There are now fewer than 26 students--I think there are 25; the criteria is 26. The school has lost one student. This school is in a growth area. There is a lot happening in that area. There is a lot of development, and that area is no doubt going to go ahead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172335"></A>
They have a very active P&amp;C--a P&amp;C that they can be proud of. These people very much care for their school. If you lose a teacher in a small school, it is disastrous for the community. The school has had a lot of acting principals. Since 2001 there have been eight principals. All this community asked for was a deferral to give them a bit of time to try to get another family to move into the area with one more child. That is all they needed before they lost that extra teacher allocation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172337"></A>
The P&amp;C, with the money they had, considered renting a house and offering it free of rent for a family to come and live in it, but they could not attract a family. They were willing to pay the rent on a house to give a family a free house to live in just so that they could get another kid at that school. That is the immensity of this problem. If you take these teachers away, people lose faith in the school, and we all know the repercussions of that. This will have a massive impact. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172338"></A>
We now have a principal who has to teach from prep right through to year 7. My office has received correspondence from Mark Conway, Pat Lyons, Darren and Leanne Canning and Greg and Helaine Lokan. I have written to Education Queensland, with little result. I have written to Russell Simpson. I know Russell very, very well. Russell works very hard but he is under the authority of the minister. It is the minister that the buck has to stop with here. The letter that we got back states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1172348"></A>
... there are several other schools throughout the state in this situation so in the interests of fairness and equity we must ensure that all such schools are treated consistently. We recognise the complexities involved in teaching one class from Prep to Year 7 and are therefore working to provide extra resourcing to assist the teaching principals in this regard. Whilst this may not be a full-time teacher, we assure you that we will do our best to provide additional resourcing within the state-wide budget. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172349"></A>
That is simply unacceptable. If we lose a teacher from that school then the whole system breaks down and people start to pull away. We need to look after our schools and I call on the minister tonight to do that. </Hansard-Body>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (10.58 pm): Teneriffe residents are celebrating because on 29 January 2010 the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland Government Gazette</Hansard-Italic>
 announced that Teneriffe was no longer a locality within Newstead but now a suburb in its own right. Support for suburb status for Teneriffe has been strong amongst the local community, with residents of Teneriffe arguing strongly for the re-establishment of the suburb of Teneriffe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180010"></A>
In 2008, I helped to form a committee of local residents, business people and political representatives for the purpose of compiling an application to the Department of Natural Resources for suburb status to be once again returned to Teneriffe. The executive members of the committee were myself, Councillor David Hinchliffe and chair Vicki Bridgstock, my then parliamentary intern, investigating the restoration of suburb status to Teneriffe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180013"></A>
The Teneriffe Working Group held meetings from July through to October, discussing and organising the application process, boundary options for Teneriffe, mail-outs and public meetings to inform and consult residents on the process. Two public meetings were held on Wednesday, 5 November at Casa Italia Community Centre on the boundary of New Farm and Teneriffe. Maps containing three suggested boundary options were circulated at the meetings, and survey forms with the three options were distributed at the meetings for people to choose which option they thought would best represent Teneriffe. Option 1 was clearly the most popular of the three options. It also had the advantage of altering only the Newstead boundary and leaving Fortitude Valley and New Farm as is.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180015"></A>
The application was lodged with the department and it conducted its own public consultation to change the status of Teneriffe. DERM administers the Place Names Act 1994 that controls the naming of localities and suburbs in local government areas. Importantly, the change to suburb status allows Teneriffe to have clearly defined boundaries to ensure computer addressing systems have accurate information. This is essential particularly for Australia Post, the police and community safety in general. A correct address could save a life.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180016"></A>
Although the area has had a long, proud and unique history since the 1820s, the neighbourhood of Teneriffe was not defined by boundaries. This has often been the cause of confusion and problems. The name ‘Teneriffe’ has been in use since the mid 19th century. James Gibbon--a prominent property speculator and member of the Legislative Assembly--bought, would you believe, 48 hectares of land in 1854 between New Farm and Newstead and called it Teneriffe as it reminded him of Teneriffe Peak in the Canary Islands where he had spent some time. He built Teneriffe House on top of the hill, and it is still in use today. It is believed that Teneriffe lost its suburb status in August of 1975, when the boundaries of Brisbane suburbs were redefined. Today, Teneriffe is back on the map. Come on down, it is a fantastic suburb. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (11.02 pm): Traffic analysis and reporting summary vehicle counts from 2008 show that on the M1 between Nielsens Road and the Elysium Road exit on the Gold Coast--which is the notorious Nerang bottleneck--8,591 vehicles travel south between 3 pm and 5 pm on a week night. That is 8,591 vehicles negotiating the Nerang bottleneck merging into two lanes. That is over 4,000 vehicles per lane. Further, this stretch of the road was squeezing in 97,000 vehicles, and all of these figures are from most recent counts in 2008. Estimations must place this vehicle count now at well over 100,000 and exponentially rising. I have been informed through recent oral reports that the latest peak hour count is now at 200,000 cars per day in the four-lane section immediately preceding the three-lane section in the central Nerang section of the M1. Those who are travelling on this road will clearly see what is leading to this problem.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180020"></A>
 The volume of vehicles travelling along this stretch alone should send a strong message to the Labor government that drastic and urgent measures need to be put in place for roads and public transport particularly in this area over the coming years. The widening of the Nerang bottleneck is due to start this June but it is well overdue. The prospect of roadworks taking over two years to complete will turn the motorway into a nightmare when the speeds are slowed to 80 kilometres per hour. As we have already seen with roadworks further south, drivers attempt to avoid the motorway--</Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just listen. They take early exits and speed along parallel roads, and this is when dangerous accidents occur. Currently, this widening project will only extend six kilometres to the Gooding Drive, Worongary exit, which too many people believe is not wide enough, not far enough and not soon enough. It has been discussed tonight that $455 million in AusLink funding was available in 2007 and it was not spent. We are only spending $158 million now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180023"></A>
My fear is that it will take a major multi-vehicle accident to occur--most likely from congestion on and diversions off the M1--before Labor will listen to Gold Coasters. This is especially so if the congestion builds back to block off the Smith Street exit. Congestion is increasing at a rapid rate. There are no alternatives beyond that, other than the Southport-Nerang road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180024"></A>
For the Gold Coast, the M1 is the critical artery for transport to Brisbane. We have an emergency here. Without the interregional corridor, there is only one link from the south to sustain that traffic into Brisbane. I call on this parliament to urgently build eight lanes from Nerang to Tugun and complete the task in the next 10 months. Facts like this must drive a greater sense of urgency. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (11.05 pm): I rise to pay my respects to Les Gray, long-term member of the Australian Labor Party, active community member and wonderful human being, who died in late November 2009. Les was a one-in-a-million person who was loved by all, and it caused great distress to many in the Bulimba electorate to see him discover a malignant brain tumour and quickly decline to pass away less than six weeks later.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180030"></A>
Les was a man who made an impact. It was not because he was a loud person or because he pushed himself forward or made sure you knew about his remarkable achievements. It was because he was a man who you just could not help but like and respect. He was absolutely grounded in decency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180031"></A>
In putting my thoughts together about Les, I asked many of our locals what they recalled most strongly about Les. What is remarkable is that there was a consistent theme from all of them. All of them said that he was a man who could be absolutely relied upon, that he was loyal and that he had the most wonderful love of and partnership with his wife, Gert. Everyone knew about Les and Gert. There was no Les without Gert, and there was no Gert without Les. They did everything together. To know both of them was to know their large and wonderful family, and we were always up on the latest doings of the various children and grandchildren--who was engaged, who had a new job, who was living where.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180032"></A>
Les’s loyalty and dependability were nowhere more obvious than in relation to his beloved Labor Party. He first joined the party in 1957 and helped out so many elected Labor representatives over that time. In state politics, that meant Jack Houston, Tom Burns, Ron McLean, Pat Purcell and me. In federal politics, it meant Ben Humphreys and Kevin Rudd. In local government, it meant Patty Beckett and John Campbell, Sharon Humphreys and Shayne Sutton.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180033"></A>
He had a lifelong commitment to a set of principles, and that was to look after the working man and woman. The same themes come up again and again in Les’s life. He was incredibly well-liked as a meat inspector in the days when meat inspectors were apparently not well liked by the workers. This was because, having worked his way up from ground level, he was always just ‘one of them’. He had no airs and graces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180034"></A>
Along with John Campbell, Pat Purcell and Frank Hughes, Les saved the Cannon Hill School of the Arts when its management committee fell apart and they were about to sell off this beautiful historical building. He applied the same tireless dedication to the wonderful Cannon Hill Sixty and Better group, and there were many members of that group at his funeral on 3 December. This group gives so much pleasure to so many people, thanks to people like Les and Gert and Frank and Bev Hughes. I know how loved Les was by all the group’s members.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180035"></A>
This wonderful man, who had such a great sense of community, was strong and positive and generous throughout his life, and he was strong and positive and generous to the end. I pay tribute to him and thank my lucky stars to have known him. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Moreton Bay, Artificial Reefs</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (11.08 pm): I bring to the attention of the House the government’s promise of artificial reefs for Moreton Bay. Before the last election at a press conference on 16 December at Wellington Point in my electorate of Cleveland, the then sustainability minister promised $1 million for the creation of three artificial reefs as part of the government’s marine park plan for Moreton Bay. In the LNP, we agreed with this element of the marine park and thought it was a good policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180041"></A>
The impetus to build these artificial reefs came from various recreational and commercial fishing groups and individual fishers during the drafting of the government’s bill. Fishing groups voiced their disapproval towards the most contentious elements of the Moreton Bay Marine Park plan, particularly the green zones, commonly referred to by the local fishers as ‘green preference zones’. The idea was that fishermen, particularly anglers, would be recompensed for the loss of the estimated 70 to 80 per cent of the best fishing areas, or the fish-rich areas of the bay, to the marine national park--and this was around 16 per cent of the actual geographic region--by the construction of these new artificial reefs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180042"></A>
The reefs, made from granite and imported German concrete, would be quickly colonised by marine life and would prove to be excellent fishing spots in a short period of time. Notwithstanding the fact that calling the three artificial reefs an acceptable offset for the loss of large amounts of fish-rich areas is a farce, this was the government’s rationale. However, to date, the only work that has been carried out is the initial small drop of granite stone at Harry Atkinson Reef that took place a few days before the minister’s press conference. Since then, no further progress has been made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180079"></A>
I recently met with local fishing identity Ben Collins, who had this to say about the missing artificial reefs--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1180084"></A>
It is obvious recreational anglers were once again blindsided by the Labor government in a blatant political stunt to grab Green votes. With the broken promise of developing three artificial reefs in and around Moreton Bay, the Labor government has indicated how they truly feel about recreational anglers. While the majority of viable and productive fishing areas have been zoned ‘green’, little or nothing has been done to increase the fish stocks through the development of these artificial reefs. This once again highlights Labor’s mismanagement of a very important recreation that extends to the tackle, fishing and boating industries.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180085"></A>
Ben is representative of the many anglers in my electorate and elsewhere who are disillusioned with this government. They are still waiting for their artificial reefs, and I today again call on the sustainability minister to keep this Bligh government promise for Moreton Bay. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (11.10 pm): All South-East Queensland residents are aware of our region’s explosive population growth. I know that the most recent statistics indicate that 2,200 people per week were moving to Queensland last year. The area of Queensland that I represent is no different from the rest of Queensland. We are experiencing an incredibly large population growth, and this at times causes problems. But this large population growth, if nothing else, suggests and emphasises the need for green space to be retained in our region. Green space provides the lungs of our city, and as our population grows we need to hold on to these green spaces so that we have room to breathe. Indeed, the preservation of green space is a cornerstone of the South East Queensland Regional Plan, which is one of the great achievements of the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180091"></A>
For that reason, I was shocked to learn of the Brisbane City Council’s secret plan to sell a large block of bushland in the suburb of Everton Park. This auction is scheduled for 25 February. It is a lovely block of land. It provides a green buffer in an area that is largely comprised of houses and apartments. The council proposes to bulldoze this land to provide yet more housing or apartments. What is even more astounding is that this bushland is home to the Everton Park Scout Hall. This bushland is used by Scouts for their activities. If the land is sold, they will be left without this land or they may need to be moved away from the site they have occupied for decades. This would be an absolute travesty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180097"></A>
The most incredible fact in this sordid tale is that local residents appear not to have been informed of it. I have driven past this site as recently as the weekend just past and there is no ‘for sale’ sign up. I have contacted a number of local residents and they have received no notification of this move by the council. In fact, I have yet to hear an example of secrecy that will so directly impact on the quality of life of residents in the Everton electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180098"></A>
For this reason, I have called an urgent community meeting at 10 am this Saturday on site. From the reaction to date, I am confident that a large group of local residents will join with me in calling on Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and his LNP team to abandon his sneaky plan to sell off our green space. We all understand that our population is growing and that we need to build in existing suburbs, but this is no excuse for sneaking through a secret proposal to sell some of the last remaining bushland in Everton Park. I call on the Lord Mayor to reverse his decision and to preserve what bushland remains in Everton Park. <Hansard-Speech-End>
