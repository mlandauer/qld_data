Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (9.31 am): I rise on two matters of privilege. The first is in relation to a breach of standing orders by the Leader of the Opposition. On 25 January I compiled an email outlining the direction needed for the LNP which I sent to all 34 LNP members, the LNP president, the state director, the Leader of the Opposition’s chief of staff and the LNP’s media adviser. On 27 January an extract of this email was aired in the media at 5 pm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998409"></A>
Following a public comment by me in the media on Friday, 29 January, with reference to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to reconsider his position within the LNP, I received a letter on Wednesday, 3 February from the Leader of the Opposition dated 29 January stating that I had been replaced on the Law, Justice and Safety Committee. I sent an email to the Leader of the Opposition on Thursday, 4 February warning him that, according to the procedures of standing orders, neither had I given a formal resignation to the Speaker nor had the matter been ratified by parliament as a whole, and I asked if he could at least reconsider his course of action until after the recommendations from the alcohol fuelled violence investigations were tabled given the extensive amount of work the committee had completed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998518"></A>
Furthermore, I wrote to the Law, Justice and Safety Committee on 11 March 2010 to place on record my concern about the process that had taken place which resulted in a further disciplinary action--that is, me being taken off five internal LNP bills committees which I was a member of. The course of action taken by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter, in my opinion, has severely compromised the process of parliamentary committee membership appointments and currently undermines the actual appointment and replacement process as a mere political reward more over an appointment of parliamentary duty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998611"></A>
Mr Speaker, given that the process for this determination currently stands as a precedent, I implore your indulgence in referring this matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee to determine the validity of the process that was undertaken. I table all documents relating to this matter. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (9.33 am): The second matter to be raised as a matter of privilege involves a very serious situation that has impeded me in carrying out my duties as an elected member of this Legislative Assembly. I was requested to come before the LNP’s President’s Committee on Thursday, 4 February which was established to outline a course of disciplinary action as a result of my telling the media that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition needed to reconsider his position in order for the LNP to reach greater heights. The proceedings of this meeting are contained in a statutory declaration signed by a justice of the peace on 8 February 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998777"></A>
At this meeting those present were LNP State President, Bruce McIver; Vice President, Gary Spence; State Director, Michael O’Dwyer; State Secretary, Joel Harrop; State Treasurer, Barry O’Sullivan; and via a telephone link, party whip, Mike Horan. A notable absence from the President’s Committee, as per the LNP constitution, was the honorary legal adviser. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998809"></A>
Following a series of abusive and intimidating confrontations by some of those present--in particular, Mr Barry O’Sullivan--Mr Bruce McIver read out a course of action they had agreed upon. This was: one, to write a letter of apology to the state president; two, the party whip, Mr Mike Horan, was to be appointed as my mentor; and, three, I was to transfer $12,000 from the taxpayer funded electorate allowance for Beaudesert and participate in a marginal--</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Those on my right!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998888"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McLINDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Three, I was to transfer $12,000 from the taxpayer funded electorate allowance for Beaudesert and participate in a marginal seats campaign committee. I was advised that a contract outlining such would be sent to me to sign on the following Monday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998919"></A>
I wrote a letter of apology to Mr Bruce McIver as directed without any detailed reference to the discussions that took place, as I was directed to keep the contents of the meeting strictly confidential. On Tuesday, 9 February 2010 a contract was emailed to me by Mr Mitchell Redford. However, I refused to sign the contract as I was deeply concerned about the legitimacy of what I was being directed to do. Furthermore, the contract had no reference to me specifically and fell short of detailing where the moneys were to come from, as outlined at the President’s Committee meeting. I raised this concern with State Director, Michael O’Dwyer, via email. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999003"></A>
The issue lapsed for some time. Mr Redford then contacted me to advise that he had great news for me as the president had decided to reduce the figure to $6,990. I was given two copies of a newly revised contract and asked by Mr Redford to sign a copy over a lunch meeting held in the parliamentary cafeteria. I advised Mr Redford that I would look over them carefully first and get back to him in the near future. Some time later Mr Redford contacted both my office and me personally to set up a meeting with Bruce McIver at the Coffee Club on Racecourse Road, Ascot, on Friday, 7 May at 12 pm. I could no longer put up with the pressure the LNP secretariat were putting on me to sign the contract and tendered my resignation from the LNP on 5 May 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999103"></A>
It is my view that what had taken place at best was highly unethical and I felt a considerable amount of undue influence and intimidation from Mr Bruce McIver in executing my duties as an elected member of this Legislative Assembly, yet I did everything I possibly could for as long as I possibly could to remain as part of the LNP. I do not intend this matter of privilege to be a reflection on those hardworking individual members of the LNP with whom I still remain friends. I ask that this matter be referred to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee so as to prevent this occurring again in the future to any member here in this Legislative Assembly. I table all relevant documents relating to this matter.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-999459"></A>
1.	That this House desires to place on record its appreciation of the services rendered to this state by the late James Robert Henry Blake, a former member of the parliament of Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-999468"></A>
2.	That Mr Speaker be requested to convey to the family of the deceased gentleman the above resolution, together with an expression of the sympathy and sorrow of the members of the parliament of Queensland, in the loss they have sustained.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999477"></A>
James Robert Henry Blake, better known to his friends and colleagues as Jim, was born in Childers on 6 October 1921 and educated at Doolbi Primary School, Childers Junior High School and the Brisbane Technical College. From 1941 to 1945, during World War II, Jim Blake served in the 2nd/8th Field Regiment in the 9th Division of the Australian Imperial Forces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003492"></A>
With Anzac Day just a few weeks ago, sadly in Mr Blake we note the passing of another person who served his country with distinction at the time of its greatest need. After World War II Jim Blake worked as a farmer, a sugarcane grower and a trawlerman and later became active in the Childers branch of the Australian Labor Party, serving as its president, vice-president and secretary at various times. Following the death of the then Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Jack Pizzey, in July 1968, Mr Blake was selected by the ALP to contest the resulting by-election in the seat of Isis. In what was seen as a very surprising result--indeed, a political upset at the time, especially as Mr Pizzey had been a member of the Country Party and it was expected that the Country Party would naturally retain the seat of Isis--Mr Blake won what was described as a vigorously contested by-election and he took his seat in this House in November 1968.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003499"></A>
Mr Blake retained the seat of Isis at the state elections of 1969 and 1972 but was defeated by National Party candidate Lin Powell at the state election of December 1974. However, Mr Blake was to make a return to this place. He obviously enjoyed his opportunity to contribute, because he came back as the member for Bundaberg. In the lead-up to the state election of 1977, the then member for Bundaberg, Lou Jensen, resigned from the ALP. Mr Blake was subsequently selected as the ALP candidate for Bundaberg. And while Mr Jensen contested the seat as an Independent, Mr Blake won the seat comfortably. It seems that Jim Blake was a specialist in difficult and unusual elections.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003504"></A>
Jim Blake continued to ably represent the people of Bundaberg until his retirement at the state election of October 1983. As a farmer, a sugarcane grower, a trawlerman and a member of the Isis district Canegrowers executive, Jim Blake was a man in tune with primary industries matters and he spoke regularly in this place about the welfare of the people who are engaged in them. During his time in the parliament, Mr Blake served as opposition spokesperson for primary industries from 1970 to 1974 and from 1978 to 1982. He also served as shadow minister for lands, forestry and water resources and was a member of the Parliamentary Printing Committee--a committee that of course we no longer have.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003508"></A>
Jim Blake was also a member of the Queensland Parliamentary Bowls Club and he and his wife, Edna, regularly represented Queensland at the annual interstate parliamentary bowling carnivals, both while he was a member and later as a former member. I am advised that Jim and Edna are both very fondly remembered by those who attended the carnivals with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003510"></A>
As well as his military and parliamentary service, Jim Blake served his community in many other ways. Amongst them, Mr Blake was a member of the Isis RSL and he was involved with the Bundaberg branch of the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex Servicemen and Women Association, and I think every member of this House knows something of the great work that that organisation does.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003512"></A>
In 2001 Jim Blake was awarded the Centenary Medal commemorating the centenary of Federation in Australia for his distinguished service to parliament, to politics and to his community. Jim Blake was another of the generation who served their country during World War II and later went on to represent their communities at one level of government or another. I place on record the government’s thanks for the many years of service that Jim Blake gave to the Australian Labor Party, that he gave to the institutions of our democracy and for the contribution that he made to his local community and the people he represented. On behalf of the government, I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy and that of this House to Mr Blake’s family and his friends. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (9.43 am): Jim Blake spent 12 years in state parliament--first as the member for Isis and then as the member for Bundaberg. As the Premier has already said, James Robert Henry Blake was born in Childers on 6 October 1921 to a canefarming family. Growing up in the rural community near Bundaberg, he attended Doolbi State Primary School and Childers Junior High School before attending Brisbane Tech College. The son of a cane grower, he joined the Army and served as a gunner during the Second World War before returning to Childers and working as a trawlerman and a cane grower. Mr Blake was heavily involved in promoting the interests of cane growers and was a member of the Isis district Canegrowers executive and a vigorous campaigner for irrigation issues in the Isis region.</Hansard-Body>

As a lifelong member of the Labor Party, Mr Blake filled various executive positions for the local community branches before running in the Isis by-election in 1968 following the death of the sitting member and Premier, Country Party MP Jack Pizzey. As the Premier has also said, Mr Blake’s victory was a surprise in the conservative seat. Interestingly, Mr Blake, just like his predecessor, Jack Pizzey, was a Childers boy who served during the Second World War as an Army gunner. During his time in the seat of Isis, Mr Blake was applauded for his efforts in ensuring the Bundaberg and district irrigation scheme was a priority for the state government.</Hansard-Body>

In 1974 Mr Blake was defeated by National Party member Lin Powell. After leaving his canefarm in 1977, he contested the seat of Bundaberg at the following state election, and he retained that seat until his retirement in 1983. During his time in the parliament Mr Blake was a shadow minister for primary industries and at other times a shadow minister for fisheries, lands, forestry and water resources. In 1980 he was a member of a parliamentary delegation to Asia. Following his retirement, Mr Blake was awarded a Centenary Medal by the federal government for his service to parliament, politics and the community. Mr Blake is survived by his wife, Edna, four daughters--Julie, Jan, Jennifer and Jayne--and eight grandchildren. I wish to join with the Premier in passing on the condolences of the state opposition to the members of his family. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (9.45 am): As the member for Burnett, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Blake. Mr Blake was a life member of the Labor Party and was born in Childers on 6 October 1921 to a canefarming family. He was a surprise victor in the seat of Isis, which is covered by the seat of Burnett, in 1968 after the sitting member, Jack Pizzey, died. Since Mr Pizzey was a Country Party member, it was expected that that party would hold the seat. But after a vigorous campaign, Mr Blake was the winner. He served as the member for Isis from 1968 to 1974 and in that time contested a by-election and three general elections. In 1974 he was defeated in the seat of Isis by a National Party candidate. At the next state election he contested and won his seat of Bundaberg, which he held for six years until his retirement in 1983. Almost 11 of Mr Blake’s 12 years in parliament were served on the opposition frontbenches and during that time he held the shadow ministries of primary industries, lands, forestry and water resources. During his term of office in Isis the Bundaberg and district irrigation scheme received state government priority.</Hansard-Body>

After his retirement, Mr Blake was awarded a Centenary Medal by the federal government for his service to parliament, politics and the community. His daughter, Julie Adler, said that Mr Blake occupied his time fishing and playing the saxophone--his two great loves beside his family. She said that he loved his music and fishing. He played several musical instruments and was self-taught. The former Labor member for Hinkler Brian Courtice has described Jim as one of life’s true gentleman and a thoroughly decent man and politician. Mr Blake is survived by his wife, Edna, four daughters and eight grandchildren. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.47 am): It is with a degree of sadness that I add to this debate as a personal friend of Jim’s, dating back to my late father. My father met him, I think, in 1961. In a touch of irony I guess, that was at the party conference that was held in Bundaberg when the member for Sandgate’s grandfather was selected as the candidate. I know my old man voted for him, and I am sure Jim did, too. Ironically enough, the candidate against him was ‘Sandbag’ Frank Sleeman.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003555"></A>
Jim Blake was one of a rare group of people who came out of a rural industry. Often those opposite like to claim the rural vote as their own, but in reality if you look at all of the seats west of the Great Divide that we used to hold you see that that is something that the fanciful nature of history has reinvented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003556"></A>
Jim Blake was born on the land and he regretted all of his life that he did not have the opportunity for higher education, and that is something one of his daughters made mention of. He insisted on having four daughters for whom tertiary education should be available. Indeed, at that time that was not a widely held view, but he was somebody who understood very clearly that it is education that unlocks inequality. He very much was a person who remembered the fact that they did it very tough on the land in those days. He lost his mother when he was very young, and he was a person who understood what struggle was all about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004868"></A>
Jim excelled at unarmed combat. It helped him in later life here. He trained people in unarmed combat before he went to New Guinea. He was a big fellow and, obviously, he could handle himself very well. Jim had a very solid army record in fighting for his country, as have a lot of Labor people who have come into this place and, indeed, members opposite can claim the same. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004869"></A>
In 1952, Jim chose to join the Labor Party. That was a pretty turbulent time in the Labor Party, as it was leading up to the split. Jim stuck with the Labor Party. He was in what was called an unwinnable seat. Having joined the Labor Party, he worked hard for various candidates over that period until his time came when Pizzey died in 1968. That was a unique election. Although Jim had a cane growing background, he never hid his politics. At the time he was very popular among the cane growers. The sugar industry was in one of its troughs. People got behind Jim, because they were sick and tired of the way the Country Party treated them. It was an out-of-the-box win. Actually, when Powell beat him the Country Party ran two candidates against him--one at each end of the electorate--in order to beat him. Lou Jensen left the Labor Party after a stink over not paying his dues. Jim went in and won that seat and then, subsequently, moved into Bundaberg, where he was highly respected not only as a local member but also as a good bloke and a good party member. Over the years when I have been in Bundaberg I saw him. He remained true to the cause right to the very end. Jim was a life member. You cannot get anything higher than that. He spent 12 years in this parliament--all in opposition--with the frustration of opposition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004873"></A>
Over the past couple of days I have taken the trouble to read some of the speeches Jim made in this place. I remember that, back in those days, it was not very fashionable to talk about China. One of the key sugar markets that Jim talked about was China. I know that he got up in this parliament and supported the fact that Burns and others went over to China with Whitlam in 1972 and opened up that market. He made the comment that if Labor people went over there they were always communists. Today, of course, we do not hear that reference.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Exactly. I will take that interjection. Jim had a great knowledge of primary industries, but he had a great love for the sea. At one stage he was a part-owner of a trawler. He was a great fisherman and spear fisherman. He spent a lot of time by the sea. I notice that in his eulogy one of his daughters said that they got their great love of fishing from their father. He was just as much at home catching a whiting in Moreton Bay as he was dragging a big reef fish up over the side outside Woodgate. To Jim’s four daughters, Jan, Jennifer, Julie and Jayne, and his wife, Edna, I say: you have lost a terrific, father, mentor and family man. The Labor Party has lost one of its sons, one of its true believers, one of its true foot soldiers of the cause, somebody who believed in a fair go, somebody who believed in the Labor Party principles of education and equality and somebody who understood the importance of primary industries.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (9.53 am): I would like to give my condolences to Jim Blake’s family. Robert James Henry Blake was always known to me as Jim Blake. He represented the seat of Isis which, in those days, ran from Hervey Bay right up to Kepnock in Bundaberg. It was quite a large seat. Jim was always very active in his electorate. He travelled around his electorate quite a bit and I got to know him when I was only a young teenager. My memory of Jim was that he was always very well respected in his electorate. One of the funny lines you used to hear was, ‘How come a cane farmer is a member of the Labor Party?’ There was always that bit of a joke, but Jim always took it very well. He was always a friendly guy and he represented Isis very well. I would like to pass on my sympathies to Jim’s family. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundaberg--LNP) (9.54 am): On behalf of the Bundaberg community, I would also like to pass on my condolences to the family of James Robert Henry Blake, or, as the previous speaker said, Jim, as he was better known throughout the whole region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004891"></A>
Jim passed away peacefully on 9 April at the Friendly Society Private Hospital, after a lengthy illness, at the age of 88. He was the beloved husband of Edna, the dearly loved father and father-in-law of Julie and Dan Adler, Jan and John Cuk, Jennifer Blake and Jayne and Paul Hampson and the loving grandfather of Joanne, Angela, Daniel, Steven, Tanya, Mark, Sarah and Katrina. To have a family like that only shows the love that this gentleman had not just for political life but also for his family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004903"></A>
As previous speakers have highlighted, Jim was an outstanding representative of the community who, throughout his political career, had the rare opportunity of serving two electorates. He was born into a cane farming family and his contribution to the sugar industry cannot be overlooked. As a member of the Isis District Cane Growers’ Executive, Jim was a vigorous campaigner for irrigation issues in the Isis region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004905"></A>
During his years in parliament Jim called upon his knowledge of the cane fields in his shadow portfolios of primary industries, fisheries, lands, forestry and water resources. That is a testament of his life experience. We know that people from the farming sector, and particularly the cane farming sector, have to be able to think outside the square. I am sure Jim was able to apply those skills in his political life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004907"></A>
After retiring from the seat of Bundaberg in 1983, Jim was awarded a Centenary Medal by the federal government for his services to the parliament, politics and the community. As previous speakers have said this morning, Jim will always be remembered by the community as a true gentleman. He was not only a respected man but also a quiet man who had a great deal of determination in whatever cause he faced. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.04 am): Last Saturday the entire nation witnessed one of those historic spine-tingling moments as a young Queenslander came through the heads of Sydney Harbour. It was the moment that Jessica Watson and her very distinctive sailboat, <Hansard-Italic>
Ella’s Pink Lady</Hansard-Italic>
, crossed into Sydney Heads to be met by a flotilla of vessels and thousands of people who had turned out to witness her return home after a remarkable, single-handed voyage across the globe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004970"></A>
This is the sort of feat that is remarkable for anyone to achieve, let alone someone so young. We cannot overlook the fact that Jessica achieved this when she was just 16. In fact, today is her birthday and I am sure that we, like many other Australians, will be wishing her a very happy birthday today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004971"></A>
Jessica Watson has defied the odds. She has defied the early criticisms of her voyage and she has silenced all the doubters. Over 210 days at sea circumnavigating the globe she has also shown a type of resilience that I think puts many of us who are much older to shame. I would ask all members to consider 210 days or seven months at sea under conditions that the word ‘difficult’ does not even begin to do justice. She dealt with often unpredictable forces of nature, she sailed some of the world’s most dangerous oceans, including the notorious Southern Ocean, and suffered numerous knockdowns, 10-metre-plus waves, freezing temperatures and horrendous weather conditions. But not once did she falter. In doing so she has made Queenslanders very proud of her as she rode her way into the history books. Jessica’s incredible solo voyage is an inspiration to many other young Queenslanders, many of whom have followed her journey with great admiration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004972"></A>
I take this opportunity on behalf of all members of this House and all Queenslanders to welcome Jessica home and to congratulate her on a truly inspiring achievement. This young lady from Buderim is a great example to the world and to an entire generation of young Queenslanders. I look forward to advising members and the public of a suitable event to welcome her home some time when she is back in Queensland in June. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004973"></A>
While I am talking about inspirational young Queenslanders, I also recognise Tommy Oar, who has been selected in the first 30 team for the Socceroos for the World Cup--another very significant achievement for someone very young. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.07 am): After what has been for many Queenslanders a horror journey through the phenomenon that was the global financial crisis, there are tangible and very welcome signs on the horizon that we are heading towards a recovery. There is no better indication that we are turning a corner than the number of Queenslanders who are finding employment. There is no better indication that Queensland is the place in Australia to be than the fact that our state is once again the jobs capital of Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004977"></A>
During the election campaign last year I set our government the ambitious task of creating 100,000 new jobs over the current term of government. What is happening? Well, new jobs figures released last week show that our state was the biggest jobs generator in Australia in the month of April, creating more than one-third of all the jobs in the country.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004978"></A>
Our jobs target is one to which our government is absolutely committed. It is a target that we are determined to achieve and it is a target that is imperative to the future of all Queenslanders. It is also a target that I can confirm to the House is very definitely on track to be achieved. After a tough start last year, when Queensland, like all states in Australia and countries of the globe, suffered the fallout of the global financial crisis, we have now created jobs for Queenslanders for nine consecutive months. For each and every one of the nine months there was jobs growth in Queensland. More than one-third of the 18,300 jobs created across Australia during April were created where? Here in Queensland! That is 6,500 jobs for Queenslanders. While unemployment continues to be a significant challenge and cracking unemployment continues to be our major focus, our trend unemployment rate remains steady at 5.5 per cent. While it remains steady, our government is determined to push it downward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004979"></A>
Clearly, our responsible job-creating strategies and our economic strategies are working. We have in place the measures to create jobs. We started with a very clear strategy: to keep our massive building program going and to make the tough decisions necessary to do just that; to deliver tax breaks for employers of apprentices and trainees and first home buyers to stimulate industry; and to ensure that we had employment initiatives and programs, like our Green Army, creating jobs. The fact that we generated more jobs in April than any other state is clear proof that our strategies are delivering. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004980"></A>
These strategies are not working just by accident. It is no accident that Queensland is emerging to be the jobs capital of Australia. This has come about firstly because we made the hard decisions required to keep the Queensland economy moving through the toughest of economic times. Labor had the strength and unity of purpose to see those decisions through and they are working.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004982"></A>
We remain totally and unapologetically 100 per cent committed to meet our target of 100,000 jobs in three years. After the release of the latest jobs figures, that target now stands at 66,100 jobs to go. We face the significant challenges--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004985"></A>
We are facing the significant challenges of emerging from the GFC at the same time as we continue to experience the largest population growth of any state. But our focus on getting Queenslanders into the workforce and keeping them there could not be stronger or clearer. We will not be complacent, unlike those opposite. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.12 am): We are all beginning to understand to a much greater extent the importance of science in the 21st century and the way that the big challenges of this century will require a much higher degree of scientific literacy across all sectors of society. Science, and the technology and innovation that it spawns, is part of the mix required to build the state’s future economy, solve many of our environmental challenges and guarantee the quality of life that is necessary for all Queenslanders. It may not be necessary for us to comprehend every scientific theory and technological breakthrough that makes our lives liveable; however, it is vital that we appreciate the critical role of science in transforming our future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007127"></A>
I am pleased that today we will celebrate here in Queensland our ninth year of Science in Parliament. This bipartisan event is an important opportunity for parliamentarians to meet with leading Queensland scientists and innovators to get a deeper understanding of how science can be used to deal with the complex challenges and opportunities facing government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007128"></A>
This year’s program will include two lunchtime briefings for members where experts and leaders from science, research and industry will discuss the latest information and trends on hot topics. The first briefing, being held later today, will be on energy and is about Queensland’s future as an energy generator. The briefing will cover three key issues: firstly, low-emission coal technologies and the science behind making Queensland’s coal industry both economically viable and, at the same time, environmentally sustainable; secondly, renewable energy and the wins to be gained from the intersection of great science, vast resources and new markets; and, finally, how the physical and social sciences can work together to ultimately improve our energy choices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007131"></A>
I recently appointed Professor Meredith to the Premier’s Council on Climate Change because of his global recognition in solar technologies. Our government is committed to meeting Queensland’s future energy needs with support from cutting-edge science. This upcoming briefing is a chance to understand the links between science, government and society by engaging with Queensland’s top scientific minds. I look forward to seeing a very strong showing at these events later today by all members. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.14 am): I also make a couple of comments about the important event that happened here in South-East Queensland on Sunday. Along with the Deputy Premier, the Minister for Main Roads and local members from Chatsworth and Bulimba, I was there with hundreds of thousands of other Queenslanders to open the second Gateway Bridge. I know that the Minister for Main Roads will have a lot more to say on this today, but I want to take the opportunity, firstly, to recognise and to congratulate the vision of the Deputy Premier when, as transport minister, he fought to get this project on the books and to deliver it, and, secondly, to recognise the Minister for Main Roads, who has overseen the delivery of this project. What has been delivered? Not only is it one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure in Australia; it has also been delivered under budget and six months early. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007136"></A>
I look forward to the bridge making a real difference to traffic management on our road system. Between this bridge and free-flow tolling, we expect to see average trips cut by about 25 minutes. That is good news for Queensland motorists and it is a clear symbol of this government delivering the infrastructure that Queenslanders need.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007137"></A>
I also take the opportunity to congratulate the workers on this project. I am very pleased that the plaque that will be on the bridge has the following words--</Hansard-Body>

 Nearly 6,000 jobs were created over the life of this project. That is what this government means by building infrastructure and creating jobs. On Sunday I was very pleased, along with many others, to formally name these bridges the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. I think everybody knows the extraordinary contribution that Sir Leo Hielscher has made over 68 years of public service. I am very pleased that we were able to recognise that formally with the naming of these bridges. I look forward to driving over this bridge along with other South-East Queensland motorists and to it making a big difference in our city road network. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (10.16 am): The Bligh government’s Toward Q2 strategy is committed to making Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people by 2020. We recognise that reducing cardiovascular disease, which is the biggest killer of men and women, is going to be critical to achieving this important Toward Q2 target. That is why we are strong supporters of the National Stroke Foundation’s Know Your Numbers campaign. Through a partnership with the Queensland branch of the Pharmacy Guild, who are just wonderful people to work with, I might add, participating pharmacies offer free blood pressure checks to Queenslanders. According to the AIHW’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australia’s Health 2008</Hansard-Italic>
 report, high blood pressure contributed to more than 14,500 deaths in 2005. Frankly, it is something that often simple medication can deal with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007149"></A>
Beginning in January 2009 the Queensland government is providing $2.5 billion over three years to the National Stroke Foundation for the operation and expansion of the Know Your Numbers program across Queensland. There are currently 208 permanent pressure stations in pharmacies across Queensland where people can have their blood pressure checked and the risks associated with high blood pressure clearly explained to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007151"></A>
Queensland is the only state that operates these permanent Know Your Numbers pressure stations. High blood pressure is the most modifiable risk factor--I will say that again: the most modifiable risk factor--for stroke. It is also a major risk factor for other diseases such as coronary heart disease and kidney disease. People who visit a pressure station and find that they have a high blood pressure are encouraged to go to their GP for a full risk assessment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007152"></A>
I am pleased to inform honourable members that this week is Know Your Numbers Week. In total, more than 350 pharmacies this week will provide free blood pressure checks to an estimated 36,000 Queenslanders. This is expected to prevent between 20 and 69 strokes by sending people at high risk of cardiovascular disease to their GP for assessment and management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007153"></A>
Know Your Numbers is a program that has proved itself highly effective in identifying Queenslanders at risk of cardiovascular disease. Unbelievably, just one in five Queenslanders who visited a Know Your Numbers pressure station in 2009 recorded normal blood pressure readings. I strongly encourage my parliamentary colleagues to make sure that their constituents are aware of this important Bligh government funded program. The National Stroke Foundation website has a pressure station location finder, which allows people to search for their nearest pressure station online. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007156"></A>
Another important related health initiative that many of my parliamentary colleagues are supporting today by wearing red is the Heart Foundation’s Go Red for Women campaign. I have a Queensland Reds tie on. The Go Red for Women Queensland campaign aims to raise awareness of heart disease being the No. 1 killer of Australian women, killing 11,000 Australian women each year. The Go Red for Women campaign seeks to raise awareness of heart disease as a women’s health issue and something of which women as young as 45 need to be aware. With high blood pressure a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, I encourage Queensland women in particular to make use of all the additional blood pressure stations operating during this week’s Know Your Numbers campaign. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (10.19 am): Queensland Health continues to work to improve the new payroll system and again I apologise to our hardworking Queensland Health workforce for this event, which should not have happened. I also thank them for their patience and tolerance. In particular, I put in a strong word for our payroll staff, who are doing a wonderful job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007191"></A>
Emergency support processes are being put in place across the state to support any staff affected by the payroll implementation. Specific staff in each facility or district are authorised to approve the disbursement of funds by cash, cheque or overnight payroll adjustments. Queensland Health has implemented a range of measures to reduce the incidence of incorrect pays. Trial pay runs are undertaken in the week prior to the actual pay run so that a manual check of data can be undertaken to determine if there are staff who worked during the pay period but who are not recorded as receiving a pay or who have received an unusually low pay, allowing pays to be adjusted. Upgrades to the speed and useability of the system have been implemented with positive feedback from payroll staff. Further testing and improvements are underway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007195"></A>
Roster screen changes have been made to make it easier for the plotting of rosters. Dual screens or larger screens have been deployed to payroll staff to enable two programs to be viewed simultaneously. Additional temporary payroll staff are being employed in the payroll hubs, the inquiry hotlines and the roster processing centre. A project team has been established to manage the work required to improve the performance of the payroll system. The payroll processing refined business systems in the districts provide support to staff and communicate with staff and unions, which are doing a great job in representing their members. The number of staff receiving no pay continues to decrease, but we know more needs to be done. Again I thank our payroll staff and hospital staff who are working tirelessly to improve the new system. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (10.21 am): On 2 June last year, the Premier rose in this House and put forward our government’s plan to restore strength to our state’s finances in the face of the devastating effects of the global financial crisis. What we put forward was a plan to make tough choices to keep our massive nation-leading building program going, to support jobs and support the economy at its time of need. The dividend from that decision can be seen in last week’s strong jobs numbers and in the weekend opening of the second Gateway Bridge. We made the choices, we set the policies and we are seeing the results.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007205"></A>
Central to our economic recovery plan was the divestment of five state-owned commercial businesses to reform the state’s balance sheet. I advise that this morning I have signed the contracts for the transaction for the commercial timber business, Forestry Plantations Queensland. Members will recall that the value estimated at the time of our announcement was $500 million. I can advise the House that the contracts I have signed this morning are for a sale price of $603 million. This result is above the original expectations we had for this transaction, representing a value-for-money result for taxpayers. It is a result that dismisses the hysteria of those opposite about a so-called firesale. I can report to the House that the government’s objectives have been met by the successful bidder, Hancock Queensland Plantations, which is part of the global Hancock Resources Group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007207"></A>
Our first priority was the workers who have built this business into what it is today. After working with unions to agree on a code of practice, we have since secured three-year job guarantees, the protection of all employee entitlements, and an enterprise bargaining agreement supported by 92 per cent of workers in a ballot. I acknowledge the commitment and the support of workers and their unions to achieving this outcome. We have delivered on our promise to protect the same public access rights to plantation land that Queenslanders currently enjoy. The walkers, cyclists, photographers and others who all enjoy our state forests will continue to do so. We have chosen a buyer from a strong field, with a proven track record of forestry management and continued investment in timber plantations. We have ensured that the new owner will fulfil the obligations set out in the South-East Queensland Regional Forestry Agreement and the Western Hardwoods plan, no ifs, no buts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007208"></A>
I can reassure the House that, like any other business, the new owners will be subject to the Queensland’s environmental laws. The Crown land under the state plantation forest will remain in public ownership, with around 10 per cent of the estate held in freehold also transferred to the new owner. The new owner will be required to continue to maintain the state plantation forest as plantation land or hand the relevant part of the licensed area back to the state. They will be obliged also to maintain a national forestry accreditation. FPQ is a commercial timber business. It is this government’s view that in 2010 the Queensland government should not be funding a timber business when that money could better be directed into our priorities: the schools, roads and hospitals that Queenslanders need. This transaction is the first plank of our plan to reform the state’s balance sheet, pay off debt and build a stronger Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007209"></A>
The government’s decision to walk this path has not been an easy one. However, this government does not shy away from its responsibilities. We are a growth state and we must deliver the infrastructure and services to meet the needs of a growing population. In order to achieve this into the future, we were faced with choices. Those choices included cutting the building program, slashing jobs to vital public services, hiking taxes like payroll tax or reassessing government ownership of some commercial businesses. We made the tough choices, we are staying the course, determined as ever to deliver jobs growth and restore strength to our state’s finances. That is our plan and we are going to stick to it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.25 am): Through QBuild, the Department of Public Works continues to improve systems to ensure that staff and others are not exposed to dangerous fibres when removing asbestos. In 2009, in conjunction with the unions, QBuild developed the Practical Asbestos Training program. The program provides staff with relevant theoretical, practical and legislative knowledge and competencies relating to asbestos removal. QBuild has continued the roll-out of those training sessions right across the state, with 1,538 staff having completed the program. Every new tradesperson and apprentice employed by QBuild this year is also required to complete the training as part of their induction. Recently at an induction meeting I reinforced the message of how dangerous asbestos can be to new apprentices. I have seen the training program in action, and it is a very efficient and thorough method of training people. I invite any member of the house who wishes to to attend a briefing on the program, which I will organise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007215"></A>
As a follow-on to the Practical Asbestos Training Program, QBuild is now progressing with further development of workers’ skills and competencies by providing asbestos refresher training and an examination. The short two-hour interactive refresher training session has been developed with BIGA, a Queensland-based registered training organisation. To date, more than 700 trade staff have completed the refresher training and undertaken the exam, which is now being assessed by BIGA. Staff passing this exam will be eligible for a B-class asbestos removal licence. At the same time, a number of QBuild’s non-trade staff are being trained in asbestos management. This includes estimators, supervisors, procurement officers and any staff whose role potentially deals with the correct management of asbestos containing materials. This is a new development and one that clearly shows QBuild’s commitment in regards to asbestos removal procedures. As of 14 May 2010, 451 operational office based staff have attended this training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007217"></A>
Last, but definitely not least, QBuild is also committed to improving the knowledge and competency of our contractor base. With this in mind, by 1 July 2010 QBuild will develop new guidelines for contractors who deal with asbestos issues in schools. These will include a new training regime prequalification. Every contractor who expects to work in schools and deal in any shape or form with asbestos will have to provide evidence that they have that prequalification and the competence to do such work. Further, the protocols between QBuild and schools will be tightened to ensure that when a contract is awarded the school is aware of this. In addition to those measures, a longer term aim is that all relevant contractor staff working on government work through QBuild will have B-class asbestos licences. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.28 am): The Bligh government is working to transform Queensland into the solar state. We are determined to make the most of our abundance of sunshine and switch to using this clean energy source wherever possible. By doing the bright thing, Queenslanders will not only help reduce their carbon emissions; they can also lower their power bills which may fall by hundreds of dollars annually for each solar system installed. It is because the benefits of solar can be economic as well as environmental that we have launched a new initiative to expand solar opportunities for sporting and community groups in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007223"></A>
We have asked the Gambling Community Benefit Fund to prioritise up to $3.3 million a year for three years to support community solar projects. Despite some media reports, there is nothing unusual about prioritising funds from the GCBF. For example, it has previously been done to promote the uptake of rainwater tanks by community groups. Eligible sporting and community organisations right across Queensland can now apply to the fund for grants to support the purchase and installation of 1.5 kilowatt solar photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot-water systems. Every dollar those groups save on their electricity bills is a dollar that can, instead, be spent supporting our community and the work that they do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007224"></A>
It is important to note that this fund has been supporting community solar projects for many years. Swimming clubs, bowls clubs, parents and citizens associations, rural fire brigades and local scout groups have already identified the benefits of solar power and had systems installed thanks to the fund. We want to encourage more organisations to join them, with the aim of installing up to 1,800 systems over the next three years. This could see Queensland’s not-for-profit groups saving more than $700,000 combined every year and also reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1,300 tonnes a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007225"></A>
What is more, we can achieve these benefits while still providing around $35 million a year for other grants from the fund. This initiative really is about doing the bright thing to help groups who play a vital role in our community to save money and save the environment for future generations. By switching to solar right across the state, we can reduce the impacts of climate change and help achieve our Toward Q2 goal of reducing Queensland’s carbon footprint by one-third by 2020. </Hansard-Body>

State Penalties Enforcement Registry</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007266"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.30 am): There has been considerable interest in the implementation of the government’s trial of tougher penalties for fine defaulters, particularly the new wheel-clamping provisions. There is, however, another major component to the State Penalties Enforcement Registry trial--that is, the new powers that relate to the seizure and sale of property. The two-year trial of seizure and sale provisions in the Brisbane area, which started on 1 January this year, is initially targeting those fine defaulters who owe more than $5,000 and for whom wheel clamping is not suitable. Debtors are given 14 days notice in which to contact SPER to start paying their debts. If no contact is made, a warrant for the seizure and sale of assets is issued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007267"></A>
As at 30 April 2010, SPER had issued 15 property seizure warning letters--four to corporate debtors with fines totalling $165,000 and 11 to individual debtors owing a total of $92,000. These notices are having the desired effect. Already, two of the corporate debtors have paid their fines in full and one made a substantial upfront payment and is now on a payment plan. Some individual debtors have been more recalcitrant. One fine defaulter who owed $6,151 continually refused to pay a five-year-old debt, forcing SPER to issue a warrant to sell the debtor’s property at a public auction. This action finally persuaded the debtor to pay their fines in full before the auction took place. While this is a good outcome, it is unfortunate and very regrettable that SPER has to go to these lengths before debtors pay their fines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007268"></A>
The expansion of driver licence suspensions to non-motor vehicle related fines also started on 1 January and, as at 30 April, there were about 17,000 SPER driver licence suspensions in place relating to non-motor vehicle offences. This is another instrument in the government’s armoury to recover money from fine defaulters who continually avoid meeting their obligations to the community and ignore the numerous warnings offered by SPER to pay their debts, including the option of paying by instalments, before their licence can be suspended. However, all of this can easily be avoided. All these fine defaulters have to do is do what the community expects and pay their fines. </Hansard-Body>

Early Childhood Literacy</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007271"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.32 am): There is no more important issue in my portfolio than increasing early childhood literacy. Only 62 per cent of Queensland children are regularly read to or encouraged to read at home, while only 61 per cent of Queensland five-year-olds were classified as on track with their language and cognitive skills. This is why the Premier and I launched the Flying Start green paper earlier this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007273"></A>
Last week I visited schools in Bundaberg, Townsville and Brisbane to look at the programs that are raising literacy levels. I was proud to announce that the Queensland Ready Readers program has been hugely successful, with nearly 600 volunteers state-wide and volunteers in the three trial areas currently undergoing training. In partnership with Volunteering Queensland, we will soon start rolling out the program state-wide, together with our state Reading Ambassadors program. I would like to thank the reading ambassadors--Brisbane Lion Jared Brennan, Brisbane Bronco Peter Wallace, Gold Coast Titan Nathan Friend and North Queensland Cowboy Ty Williams--who have volunteered their time to promote reading to children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007283"></A>
Furthermore, the Bligh government has committed to giving every new Queensland child their first book. The Bligh government has the runs on the board when it comes to taking action to improve early childhood literacy. We know that making sacrifices to increase investment in education is the right thing to do. In stark contrast is the Queensland Liberal National Party, which has continued to offer no policy for Queensland parents. The one piece of policy it has resolutely stood by is its productivity dividend, which would see 36,000 Queensland jobs slashed. But a productivity dividend does not just affect jobs; it slashes vital programs that help those who need it most. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007285"></A>
If you want to see a Liberal National Party government productivity dividend in action, you just have to look to Western Australia, Mr Speaker. As part of what the Liberal National Party considers non-essential areas, it has cut spending on library books by 40 per cent. While a Bligh Labor government increases spending on early childhood education and literacy, a Queensland Liberal National Party government would stop buying books and mortgage our libraries. An LNP government would undermine the most fundamental area of our children’s education. </Hansard-Body>

Aboriginal Death in Custody, Findings of Coronial Inquest</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.35 am): On Friday, Deputy Chief Magistrate Brian Hine handed down the findings of the coronial inquest into the death of Cameron Doomadgee, also known as Mulrunji, at the Palm Island Police Station in 2004. Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine delivered an open finding on the cause of Mulrunji’s death. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007292"></A>
The deputy chief magistrate made two recommendations as well as a number of findings in relation to the actions and behaviour of police in this matter. The recommendations were (1) that future investigation of deaths in police custody which exhibit indicia of unnatural causes or which have occurred in the context of police actions or operations be undertaken solely or primarily by the CMC; and (2) that in future cases the CMC gives closer consideration to insisting upon separate legal representation for police witnesses in serious contentious matters. The government will consider the implications of recommendation 1 and respond at an appropriate time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007293"></A>
I can advised the House, however, that yesterday evening the CMC wrote to the Queensland Police Service advising of its intention to take primary responsibility for the investigation of deaths in police custody, working under the direction of the State Coroner, who has ultimate responsibility for any such investigation. The CMC advised that such arrangements were to commence immediately.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007294"></A>
As police minister, I am obviously concerned at the findings which suggest collusion and fabrication of evidence on the part of several officers involved. I know that the Police Commissioner shares my concern, as does the broader Queensland community. These issues will, of course, require careful analysis to determine what future action is required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009872"></A>
As members are aware, the CMC has indicated that it intends to release its report into the police investigation of Mulrunji’s death in the coming weeks. Given that this report is also expected to raise issues related to the conduct of the officers involved in the investigation, it is my view that it is appropriate to wait for that report to be made public before finalising the required response. The totality of issues raised by both reports is likely to give rise to significant issues which will require decisions by government, the Queensland Police Service and the Crime and Misconduct Commission. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.38 am): I have more good news for Queensland. The Bligh government is building bridges right across our great state. We are building a better, brighter future for all Queenslanders. As the Premier mentioned, on Sunday I joined with her, the Deputy Premier and the members for Bulimba, Chatsworth and Clayfield for the official opening of the new Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge across the Brisbane River. More than 200,000 Queenslanders took a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk the length of Queensland’s newest and biggest bridge. We even had a three-legged ‘Jake the Peg’ putting his best foot forward. Motorists will benefit next weekend when four of those new lanes open to traffic for the first time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010015"></A>
But the good news keeps on coming. There is also the new Houghton Highway bridge from Brisbane to Redcliffe. These two projects have been big jobs generators for Queenslanders. All up, they have resulted in almost 7,000 jobs for workers in road construction and related industries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010016"></A>
We are building bridges right across regional Queensland as well. There is the new $148 million Forgan Bridge in Mackay--a state-of-the-art structure that spans the mighty Pioneer River. The first Forgan Bridge was built some 72 years ago by another Labor Premier who was a great believer in capital works projects to drive our economy in tough economic times. The new Forgan Bridge generated more than 430 jobs and gave the local Mackay economy a real kick-start at a time when it was needed most. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010019"></A>
Up in the Far North another bridge-building project is powering ahead--that is, a new $15 million bridge across the Endeavour River. I know that my colleague the member for Cook is very proud of that structure. It is a concrete bridge built to withstand the big wet in the Far North and is another big jobs generator for the Far North with almost 120 direct and indirect jobs involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010020"></A>
Heading down the highway to Townsville, we are building a new bridge at the mouth of the Ross River as part of our $190 million Townsville Port Access Road. All up, Main Roads is responsible for nearly 3,000 bridges right across Queensland. We are not only building new ones; we are also sprucing up the ones we have already got. Our road crews are hard at work from Bamaga out to Birdsville down to Burleigh and everywhere in between. It does not get much better than that. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.41 am): The Bligh government is delivering jobs for Queenslanders today and many jobs through our partners in local government. In fact, Greg Hallam, the executive director of the LGAQ, has been in the media this week explaining that council employee figures have risen from 38,000 to 40,000 in the past two years. That is an extra 2,000 jobs across Queensland’s 73 local governments. Queensland’s rising population means that council workforces right across the state are growing. </Hansard-Body>

Just two weeks ago I was in Western Queensland for the Western Queensland Local Government Association conference. I visited the towns of Quilpie and Windorah, spent time at the conference at Boulia--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010033"></A>
From the conference at Boulia I went on to Bedourie. It was marvellous to see the impact of water in Western Queensland, and it was marvellous to see the optimism and the growth that is occurring in these communities and therefore in the works programs for their local governments. One particular dimension of council work in Western Queensland is the work done on contract to Main Roads. For councils this means more staff--more staff out on the ground performing roadworks and maintenance and more staff working to grow local economies. </Hansard-Body>

During 2009-10, the Department of Infrastructure and Planning’s local government services will pay $530.4 million to local governments in state funded grants and subsidies. Of this, $492.6 million is for capital works projects. Projects funded by local government are under construction right now in Bamaga, Quilpie, Windorah, Townsville, Gympie, Karumba, Proserpine, Innisfail, Maleny, Kilcoy, Tallebudgera and everywhere else in Queensland. These subsidies support thousands of jobs for contractors, tradespeople, labourers and others. This means jobs for Queenslanders. Local government is working hard and more so because of the huge contribution through the state government. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.43 am): I am pleased to report that work on the Wyaralong Dam project near Beaudesert is on track, with construction on the dam wall now well underway. The majority of the dam’s foundations have been dug to prepare for the 500-metre dam wall. Work is also well advanced on the excavation of 220,000 cubic metres of rock from an on-site quarry to produce the roller compacted concrete which will be used to form the dam wall. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010039"></A>
This project will deliver water security and jobs. Once complete, Wyaralong Dam, in conjunction with the nearby Cedar Grove Weir, will supply 21,000 million litres of water every year--enough water for close to 300,000 people. It will also create 420 jobs. This is part of the state government’s record $18.2 billion building program, which is expected to secure 127,000 local jobs throughout the state in this financial year alone.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010041"></A>
During construction of the Beaudesert-Boonah Road realignment 140 people were employed, 80 of whom were from the region. A total of 52 local businesses have been involved in the project so far. On Sunday, more than 500 local runners and walkers set foot on the road realignment for the first time to take part in a charity fun run which raised more than $13,000 for the Cancer Council Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010043"></A>
The realignment, which is expected to open to traffic next month, will improve travel times between Boonah and Beaudesert and increase safety for the 1,600 motorists that use the road each day. This important project, which continues to highlight the importance of local jobs in our program, also highlights the Bligh government’s commitment to generating jobs while building the important infrastructure for tomorrow’s Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.45 am): From late this year Queensland will have the most modern and secure driver licensing regime in the country. Following on the heels of the go card, the country’s best smart card public transport ticketing system, the new Queensland driver’s licence will incorporate state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to help the fight against fraud and identity theft. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010050"></A>
The new driver’s licence will be plastic, will be the size of a credit card and will have an embedded computer chip which securely stores product and personal information. Critically, the photograph on the card is a biometric image, matching 16 facial points against records held on the department’s database. The keeping of such information means it is virtually impossible for an individual to obtain a fraudulent licence with another person’s details. It also has a number of visual security features including a hologram, special inks, a watermark and shadowing. The security features will help make the licences extremely difficult to duplicate and will help combat identity theft. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010051"></A>
ABS figures show that in 2007 over 800,000 Australians were victims of personal fraud and lost a combined total of $977 million. This includes 87,000 victims in Queensland. Providing the most secure licences in Australia comes at a cost, but this is value for money. The cost of a new Queensland driver’s licence in five years will be what citizens in New South Wales are paying right now. Next year the most secure licence in the country will still be cheaper than licences in four other states which do not offer the same level of protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010053"></A>
Twenty years on from the introduction of the laminated licence, it was time for us to update and improve security for licence holders. Five new products will be available. They are the driver’s licence, the heavy vehicle licence, the marine licence indicator for people who do not hold a driver’s licence but have a marine licence, an industry authority card--for example, for bus and taxi drivers--and the adult proof of age card, which replaces the 18+ card and will make it even more difficult for under-age drinkers to enter licensed premises using a fake ID. A carefully planned rollout of the new licensing system will begin with Department of Transport and Main Roads staff followed by people in Toowoomba later this year. </Hansard-Body>

the Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 written by Steven Wardill on 14 May 2010, last week I was asked by a reporter this question: when did you first sleep with your wife? Like all members of this place, I prefer to keep the details of my personal relationship personal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010100"></A>
However, the relationship I have with my wife and the circumstances of how we met unfortunately have become the subject of an extremely hurtful and damaging public discussion after Mr Wardill was given information by the opposition leader’s office which alleges or impugns that I rorted my official parliamentary travel. It is a scurrilous allegation which I absolutely reject, and today in order to correct the record I will table a spreadsheet and documentation which details my official trips to North Queensland from 2005 to 2009.</Hansard-Body>

In terms of the summary of the trips, the total number of trips was 19--to Townsville 15, to Cairns three and to the Torres Strait Islands one. The <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 article implied that I only developed a love affair with Townsville and North Queensland after I met my Townsville wife-to-be in 2008. Prior to meeting my wife on 28 February 2008 in Rockhampton at an official tourism dinner and then developing a personal relationship on 13 September 2008, I had already as a senior opposition shadow cabinet minister for police and corrective services and also tourism, regional development, small business and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partnerships travelled to Townsville nine times. I will repeat that fact again because it is important to bust this falsehood being peddled by some people from the LNP and some media that I suddenly developed a fascination for Townsville only after I met and became intimate with my wife. Nine out of 15 official trips when I travelled to Townsville were before I met and became intimate with my wife because I was loyally and diligently carrying out National Party and then LNP official policy business. By way of proof, I will read extracts from three shadow cabinet minutes. On 18 May 2006 the coalition leader in his report says--</Hansard-Body>

 Mr Speaker, as evidenced by the presence of the three Labor members in Townsville, the LNP does not have a sitting member and, being the capital of North Queensland, Townsville is and was a focus for shadow minister visits and I was part of the team which was expected to visit. I table details of those visits to Townsville as a shadow minister before I met my wife: trip 1, tour of the Burdekin; trip 2, shadow cabinet meetings; trip 3, Hinchinbrook preselections, travel with the member for Callide; trip 4, tours of Townsville; trip 5, travel with the member for Caloundra and shadow Attorney-General to Townsville; trip 6, meeting with the Young Nationals and a criminology conference; and trip 7, meeting with prison officers and union reps and whistleblowers regarding the management of sex offenders.</Hansard-Body>

On 8 February I met my wife-to-be on a professional basis at the official tourism awards dinner at Rockhampton. At the time she was managing three tourist information centres, 100 volunteers and helped me create the LNP tourism policy. On trip 8 I met with a whistleblower regarding the closure of the cardiothoracic unit; trip 9, shadow cabinet in Townsville; and trip 10, the official North Queensland tourism awards and met with Townsville Mayor Les Tyrell and also toured Magnetic Island. It was at that time that our relationship went from being professional to personal. From that day I visited Townsville another five times comprising a North Queensland economic development conference, an official LNP conference and corporate dinner, rally protesting about the government’s management of the rogue croc on Magnetic Island, meeting with LNP candidates and press conference, and the launch of the tourism policy in Townsville in the lead-up to the 2009 election.</Hansard-Body>

Mr Speaker, there were also another five trips--private trips--I took to Townsville which I paid for out of my own finances and for which I did not claim one cent of taxpayer funds. If I was dishonest, I could have manufactured an official reason to visit and claimed government allowances yet I did not, and I table document 16.</Hansard-Body>

Even though my staff and I worked hard on the day Mr Wardill rang in order to provide him with all of the details of my travel to Townsville that he requested, his resulting article disregarded the information from my office and placed more value on the biased, malicious and poisonous political opinions of the people supplying him the information rather than on an accurate and balanced representation of the facts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010124"></A>
Before publishing the article, Mr Wardill and the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 also failed to obtain an opinion from you, Mr Speaker, and the Clerk of the Parliament regarding the legitimacy of my travel to Townsville. If that opinion had been sought, as witnessed by your public statements and observations on 14 May 2010, Mr Wardill would have been forced to include these two important facts in the article: I paid from my own finances for every personal trip I made to Townsville, including accommodation, and every journey was certified and checked by Parliamentary Travel. The number of my official visits to Townsville prior to even meeting my wife was very high because both leaders of the opposition--the members for Callide and Southern Downs--had asked me as a senior and experienced shadow minister to participate in the coalition and then the LNP’s political strategy of dramatically increased representation in North Queensland.

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. In closing, I want to make an important point. I believe I won political support for the LNP in Townsville by following coalition and LNP directions to travel there often in carrying out political party work, and for certain members of the LNP to use that travel and work against me sinks to a new political low. I have watched my wife cry daily because of the lack of morals, human decency and complete disregard for the truth demonstrated by some members of the LNP. I hope the people of Townsville and North Queensland remember how the LNP leadership used my travel and work in their communities and the fact that I fell in love with and married a Townsville girl as part of a sleazy political attack. I hope the people of North Queensland remember that when they are next at the ballot box.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health, Payroll System</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010147"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.57 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. It is 10 weeks, 2 months and five pay cycles since working families employed by Queensland Health have been able to properly pay their bills, and I ask: if Health workers wake up tomorrow morning and again find themselves out of pocket, is there any reason left--any excuse left at all--for why the health minister should keep his job when he cannot deliver a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010175"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I would draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the statement made earlier by the Deputy Premier and health minister, who outlined to the House in a statement the actions that have been taken to ensure that we are seeing systemic improvement in the technical problems being experienced by the Health payroll system. I join with the Deputy Premier in stating unequivocally that it is simply not good enough and entirely unacceptable that Queensland Health staff are not able to access the pay that they are entitled to electronically.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010185"></A>
But I take issue with the assertion in the Leader of the Opposition’s question that there are Queensland Health staff who are being denied the opportunity to get their pay manually. I think it is important that every member of the House understands, regardless of all the inevitable political argy-bargy that there will be about this, that there is a safety net in place for every Queensland Health employee. The fact that they are not necessarily paid correctly electronically does not mean that they are not entitled to their pay or that there are not arrangements in place at every hospital to ensure that they can be paid the old-fashioned way--manually. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010186"></A>
Any Queensland Health staff who have not received all of the pay that they are entitled to are entitled to have either a cheque drawn for them--and that has been done in most cases within 24 hours--or to have a payment made to their bank account. In my view, anybody in this House of any political persuasion who encounters any constituent of theirs from Queensland Health who is experiencing those kinds of problems has an obligation to make sure that those people know about those arrangements and to draw it to their attention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010187"></A>
I also recognise that a number of people have brought this matter to the attention of their unions. Their unions have ensured that those matters have been dealt with. There are, of course, numbers of staff in Queensland Health who are not members of unions. All they have to do is ring the hotline, talk to their local managers and there will be a payment made. </Hansard-Body>

 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. In 44 days time the Premier faces a simple test: will she accept the presidency of the Labor Party and become the national head of an organisation that plans to tax Queensland jobs out of existence? I ask: does the Premier maintain that protecting Kevin Rudd’s job is more important than protecting the jobs of working Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am very pleased to advise the House that the Queensland government, through my efforts and through the efforts of the Treasurer and the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy, is working very closely with not only the mining companies of Queensland but also the federal government to ensure that, through the current consultation process on the resource rent tax proposals, at the end of the day we see a system that not only encourages investment, development and expansion of Queensland’s mining industry but also ensures that all Australians, including Queenslanders, see those companies pay their fair share of tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010194"></A>
These sorts of regimes can work. They have worked before in Australia and in other parts of the world. In fact, they were the preference of the mining companies, if we get the details right. That is exactly what we are determined to do. </Hansard-Body>

I thank the Leader of the Opposition for a question this morning on the issue of leadership, because the issue of leadership is the central question facing this parliament and the Liberal National Party today.

The member for Surfers Paradise asked a question about political leadership. The list of questions for the member for Surfers Paradise gets longer and longer. How many other members are under review and under investigation--or do we only find out about these investigations when people leave the party? If the member for Surfers Paradise cannot answer these questions today, he does not deserve to be in the job of opposition leader. Who is running the LNP? John Paul Langbroek or Bruce McIver?

Mr WENDT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would also like to acknowledge the student leaders from the Lowood State High School who are here in the chamber this morning for the very first time. My question is to the Premier. Can the Premier update the House on the government’s commitment to deliver jobs for Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010216"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question and for what I know is a deeply held personal commitment that he has to the dignity of work and ensuring that a Labor government delivers jobs wherever possible. As I outlined earlier, we have a commitment to 100,000 jobs being created in the term of our government and we are well on track to meeting that target. Queensland is now delivering jobs at a rate faster than any other state of Australia. We can thank the employers of Queensland who have taken up the rebates that we offered and who are taking on the work programs that we have offered. We made the hard decision to keep the building program moving. What is it doing? It is delivering jobs for Queenslanders. When you want to take an economic course of action, that requires strength and unity of purpose. That is what we have had. That is why Queenslanders are seeing job recovery out there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010217"></A>
However, as I said earlier, there is one job today that is on the line and that is the job of the opposition leader. Not only do we have a series of questions about Mr McIver’s intervention in the Liberal National Party--who is investigating who, who is doing reviews, what does the member for Surfers Paradise know about it--but also today we have heard even further allegations of shonky contracts being issued by the LNP leadership to members of the LNP using standover tactics to hand over money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010218"></A>
These are simple questions for the member for Surfers Paradise today. How many contracts have been signed? Who has signed them? What has been the contractual basis and what funds have been transferred? What did the member for Surfers Paradise know about this? If he cannot or will not answer these questions, he is simply not fit for the role of opposition leader. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010219"></A>
There are only two reasons he cannot answer these questions: he does not have a clue what is going on and Mr McIver is running the show or he is complicit in the LNP’s dirty little secret--the secret shonky contracts. The member for Surfers Paradise is up to his eyeballs in it. The LNP has a dirty little secret--secret contracts. The Mundingburra MOU is back. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier. Will the Premier release her government’s modelling on the impact that Rudd and Labor’s super mining tax will have on the Queensland economy and jobs or does the Premier still believe she has a right to hide information from Queenslanders on the eve of a federal election? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013006"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. There is as yet no resource rent tax in Australia. There is a consultation period during which the federal government is discussing with mining companies and with relevant state governments and other organisations the various parameters. The impact of a tax that does not exist is not something that I am wasting my time with. What I am doing is talking to the Mining Council, talking to the LNG companies and talking to the federal Treasurer and the Prime Minister. We are not using Treasury resources to model something that currently does not exist. We are working to ensure that the parameters of this regime will be relevant. </Hansard-Body>

 Well they may call out from across the chamber. Until they answer these questions the people of Queensland are entitled to worry about this organisation. The people of Queensland who voted LNP voted for the people in this chamber to run a political party, but what they did not know is that behind the scenes there is a man called Bruce McIver that they never elected and they do not know about. And what is he doing? He is undertaking secret investigations of elected members that we know nothing about. Here are the questions for John Paul Langbroek today.</Hansard-Body>

 The Leader of the Opposition has a long list of questions to answer for the people of Queensland.

I thank the member for Waterford for the question. The member for Waterford represents an electorate that understands what tough times are like and certainly felt the effects of the global financial crisis. Our government has a very clear economic plan, a plan that will create jobs, a plan that is about growing a stronger Queensland and a plan that will see the Queensland budget pay down some of its debt so that we can continue to invest in new infrastructure in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013019"></A>
As I have said, that plan is starting to deliver on jobs. We could not get a better symbol of a Queensland on the move than the opening of the Gateway Bridge on Sunday. That bridge, along with the other bridges in Mackay and other parts of Queensland, is a powerful symbol that this government is getting on with the job, delivering some of the biggest projects in Australia six months early. That takes planning. There has to be a way forward; there needs to be a plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013020"></A>
I was very interested to see that not only did those opposite not have a plan; they cannot develop a plan and they cannot even have a planning day. Early in May the Leader of the Opposition had a big day out. He was going to have a planning day. In political circles this is known as a love-in. John Howard flew in to jump on the <Hansard-Italic>
Love Boat</Hansard-Italic>
, while we had two members jumping out of the <Hansard-Italic>
Love Boat</Hansard-Italic>
 at exactly the same time. I am guessing that that certainly was not part of the plan. What did those opposite have to say about what Mr Howard said? The member for Surfers Paradise said it was great to hear from the former Prime Minister, it was absolutely thought provoking. What did he say? He said that the LNP should reconsider its position on asset sales. How do we know that that is what he said? Because no fewer than six members of the LNP went out and leaked it to the media. We know that at least one of the six was the member for Southern Downs because he has been fingered by the member for Beaudesert as the person who leaks every other thing out of the caucus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013021"></A>
So the big planning day went like this: two defectors, six leakers, no policy--nothing, not a clue. What we know is that the team on the other side of this parliament have all started to leak on each other. They are having reviews and investigations on each other. </Hansard-Body>

Will the Treasurer guarantee that not one more Queensland mining project will be suspended or cancelled because of Kevin Rudd’s super tax? </Hansard-Body>

I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and welcome him back to these shores from his participation in the trade mission on behalf of Queensland industry--the only person from the opposition who has shown they are willing to do anything in support of Queensland jobs. I also welcome him back into the time zone which will greatly enable him to facilitate his long-held ambitions that he declared on day one of returning were very difficult to fulfil because it is hard to do the numbers when you are in a different time zone. We welcome him back into the zone and wanting to talk about, as ever, someone else’s policies, because there is not a policy for those opposite to talk about. The reality is, of course, that we know that the shadow Treasurer is back in town, we know that he has broken bread last night with another defector of the LNP, the former member for Cunningham, with the member for Callide in attendance, no doubt hatching and plotting and scheming what they would do once they were all back in the right time zone. Now that they are back in the time zone, where are they retreating to? They are retreating back to the same old behaviour and talking about an issue that is not a policy creation of this Queensland government. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1013029"></A>
On the resource super profits tax, our policy criteria from day one has been this: can a resource rent taxation regime work in this country? Yes. What is the evidence for that? It is the development of the North West Shelf. Does anyone remember the Gorgon deal that was signed a couple of months ago? It was signed under a 40 per cent resource rent taxation regime. The reality is that if one gets the design right, if one gets the cap allowance right, if one gets the definition right then one can make sure that a resource rent taxation arrangement can work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013030"></A>
What is the evidence for that? The Minerals Council of Australia, in its submission to the Henry taxation review, asked for a version of profits based taxation. It asked for resource rent taxation. But, of course, will we hear that from those opposite? No, because they are only interested in cheap politics. Our message is very clear to the resources industry and we have met with them on a number of occasions. We are interested in a tax design that promotes jobs and investment. That is the test that this government will apply to our support for any new arrangement. We have sat down and done the hard yards with the resource companies of this state. I encourage those opposite to do the same hard yards. They will find that the resource industry in this state knows that this government understands the industry they are in, is providing the hard work, is providing the policy grunt and is doing the hard yards in Canberra to make sure that the end result is good for the Queensland economy. When the mining industry is booming the Queensland economy is doing well, and not just that; the national economy is doing well. For all the benefits of new growth, new investment and new jobs, we remain determined to make sure that these new arrangements protect investment and protect jobs.</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for Bulimba for her question and for her ongoing commitment, like every single member of this government and every single member of the Labor Party in this state, to generating jobs and providing the dignity of work for working people around this state. I can advise the House, as the Premier did earlier, that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the independent authority that produces these statistics, 6,500 jobs were created in Queensland last month. That is more jobs than any other state--not just pound for pound but more than any other state. Of those jobs, 4,500 were full-time jobs to ensure Queensland continues to head towards meeting its target of delivering 100,000 net new jobs over the life of this parliament. </Hansard-Body>

 This, of course, is something that is completely alien to those opposite. What else has happened in the time since this parliament last sat?

He did not tell the truth. Then at estimates he promised policies. What was the result? No policies. He did not tell the truth. Then he was off to the Press Club last year for a big promise on policies. What was the result? No policies. He did not tell the truth. Then during the last sitting week he promised--and CEDA promoted--that we would find all the policies and plans from the alternative government of Queensland. What happened when he turned up?

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the appointment of Hancock Timber as the successful bidder for the freehold land and timber assets of Forestry Plantations Queensland, and I ask: can the Treasurer confirm that former Deputy Premier Jim Elder handled the introductions and negotiations of this deal, and can the Treasurer guarantee that no success fee will be paid to Mr Elder? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015379"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow minister for his question. I am not aware of any involvement of Mr Elder in the transaction that has been conducted. The process has been oversighted by an independent probity adviser. The reality here, of course, is that this is a process that has been conducted transparently on foot. It has been overseen by a probity adviser. There are no complaints from any other bidder in a strong field. That was put in place. So the answer to the question about whether or not there is a success fee is: I very much doubt it, because there is no involvement of which the government is aware of Mr Elder or indeed any other person acting for or on behalf of Hancock. If there was, then that is a question that can be dealt with in the probity process. I have to hand a report signed off by our probity adviser. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015380"></A>
Of course, the reality here is this: what this government has done is secure a transaction that is in the interests of Queensland taxpayers. We have done that in a way that has secured a value-for-money result for Queensland taxpayers. What we have done is secured a result here whereby we see that the plantation forest tenure in Queensland will continue to be plantation forest tenure. That will continue to be planted. Every element of the South-East Queensland Forests Agreement will be preserved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015382"></A>
Native forest logging will end in 2025 as planned. Public rights of access will be preserved and Hancock will acquire suitable accreditation. They already have a level of accreditation in Australia and they will continue to maintain that independent level of forestry accreditation. If they are not continuing to plant on the plantation forests, that land will revert to the state under the terms of the licence deed. So the reality here is that what we have secured is a transaction and a sale price that is to the benefit of the Queensland taxpayers and to the benefit of the Queensland balance sheet. The process has been overseen by an independent probity adviser. The reality is that, through that process, those issues have all been dealt with and what you see here is a transaction concluded at value. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He has a very strong commitment to workforce reform and workforce development in relation to Queensland Health and generally. One of the things about Queensland Health is that it is fundamentally not only about bricks and mortar but also about jobs. Health services need to be delivered by people. It is one of our essential items of faith that we will be committed to continued growth in our Health budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015399"></A>
We have a $6 billion health building program. The next closest state to Queensland is New South Wales at $2 billion. That will deliver nearly 40,000 construction jobs over the life of those projects. We have one of the fastest growing populations, and that of course presents us with opportunities as well as challenges. More than ever, our focus will be on investing in areas such as health, education and roads. The difference is that the Leader of the Opposition believes that investment should be in coal trains that coal companies can pay for and the government believes that we should be investing more and more in things such as schools and health and in our continued growth in that. The ageing population in this country brings continued challenges for us in Health, and with the second longest life expectancy on earth we will need to have more and more provision for people to live longer with complex health needs. </Hansard-Body>

And that is no thanks to people like John Howard. More and more we will roll out those skilled workers. The Queensland government ultimately does not regulate training places; the Commonwealth government does. So we are looking forward to the further commitments from the Rudd government in relation to the number of places for GP training and, similarly, the commitment at a national level to rolling out practice nurses, particularly in regional Australia, to actually facilitate that more.</Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have a question for the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent rehabilitating the Great Artesian Basin. With underground water used in some areas of the basin still exceeding recharge, can the government guarantee that the estimated 350,000 megalitres--equivalent to the one-third capacity of the Fairbairn Dam--of groundwater to be used annually in coal seam methane gas extraction will not impact on water pressures and levels of more than 13,000 existing groundwater bores in the Surat Basin alone? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015451"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the important question that he asks. I acknowledge that, across my very diverse portfolio, issues such as sustainable levels of extraction of groundwater, particularly coming out of the Great Artesian Basin, are something that many rural Queenslanders will have an interest in. The question raised by the member has been raised by a number of landholders and their industry associations, such as AgForce. It is also a question raised by myself. As minister for mines, I am very keen to see the development of the coal seam gas to the LNG industry and the benefits that will bring, particularly for rural and regional Queensland. However, I have made it quite clear, and reiterated just yesterday at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association’s fiftieth annual conference, that that development cannot come at any cost. The development of that industry must be sustainable and it must be environmentally sustainable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015454"></A>
From time to time questions arise, and some of them have received some attention in the media recently. They need to be followed up and answers need to be provided to landholders. When landholders ask questions such as whether the extraction of water as part of the process of extracting coal seam gas will impact on adjacent aquifers, including the Great Artesian Basin, industry has a responsibility to respond to those questions. They are legitimate questions. That is why later today or tomorrow I will be introducing legislation to further the government’s oversight of the development of this industry. It is also why I have decided that the independent Queensland Water Commission should be the body to answer those questions. It has demonstrated a capacity to investigate those kinds of issues and to do so in a transparent way so that landholders and other interested parties can be assured--</Hansard-Body>

We have responded appropriately by engaging the independent Queensland Water Commission to oversight those issues. Recently I released a media release that also outlined our response and the responsibilities of companies. Where demonstrated impacts have occurred, they will have the responsibility to make good. They will need to take the appropriate action. If damage has occurred, it is the company’s responsibility to address those issues. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question and for her interest in matters relating to recycling. The reality is that we have developed a whole-of-government approach to recycling when it relates to the demolition of buildings. A perfect example of that has occurred at Kangaroo Point, where 90 per cent of a building was recycled as part of the construction of a new park in that area. That was a particularly good project, because initially the target was 60 per cent and we exceeded that target by 30 per cent. Across government we are aiming to start modestly at 40 per cent and I think we will make some really good gains by recycling things such as timber, glass, steel and bricks. I have asked the department to pursue a policy of making recycling ports available in government buildings to recycle mobile phones in the first instance and other IT products. We will see how that goes. </Hansard-Body>

These are very serious charges, yet this morning not one member opposite stood up and talked about their recycling policy in that regard. That is because they do not have any policies, so they cannot recycle them. We do know that they want to recycle government money into their pockets, which is their policy as far as I am concerned.

Clem7, Speed Cameras</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015475"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the honourable Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. When the government spent $2.5 million installing noncompliant speed cameras in the Clem7 tunnel, over 1,100 speeding drivers escaped detection. How can Queenslanders take speed enforcement seriously when the Labor government is not even prepared to make its speed cameras comply with Queensland law? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015477"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. The speed camera enforcement program is an important part of the overall program to enforce speed limits across the state. As the member is aware, the current range of cameras is predominantly wet film cameras. However, on five sites we are trialling digital speed cameras, point to point, combined red light and speed cameras, and fixed speed cameras with digital technology. The Clem7 tunnel is the first location where the digital technology has been introduced. They work well. In fact, as the member has alluded to, since the opening of the tunnel a large number of people have been detected speeding. Recently an issue arose that identified that the process for testing the cameras themselves had not been followed. Yesterday the Police Service stood up at a media conference and acknowledged that that was an embarrassing issue for the Police Service, but it in no way reflects upon the technology that has been used. It works. In fact, those 1,100-odd people were speeding in the tunnel. In this instance we have given them the benefit of the doubt, because if those particular tickets were challenged before a court, they may well have been ruled invalid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015478"></A>
I want to make it very clear that this is not an issue with the technology; it works. More than 1,100 people have sped in the Clem7 tunnel since it was opened. That is not good news for Queenslanders, as one of the key issues with putting the speed cameras there was to ensure that the speed limits were abided by in a high-risk environment. The issue was that a regulation was passed which reflected the requirements for the existing cameras, which was for a practical test or an actual test to be undertaken on the camera each time maintenance was undertaken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015480"></A>
With these cameras, because they are digital, maintenance can be undertaken by both the QPS remotely and the vendor based in Melbourne remotely. It was identified that on each occasion when adjustments to technology or software took place that particular test was not undertaken in all instances. As I have indicated, it was a procedural issue. The Police Service has acknowledged its embarrassment at not being able to admit that it had undertaken all of those tests that were required. As of yesterday, all of those required tests will be undertaken, so anyone who speeds in the Clem7 tunnel will now get their ticket and pay their fine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015481"></A>
The speed camera program generally is an important part of our enforcement strategy--the Clem7 tunnel being a part of that. There is clear evidence that the existence of both fixed speed cameras and indeed our new policy of covert speed cameras have a direct influence on driver behaviour. To give an example, one of the recent fixed speed cameras on the coast had about 2,600 detections in the first month of operation; four or five months later they are down to 500 or 600. So they do have an impact on driver behaviour. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. This week marks a significant milestone in the administration of births, deaths and marriages in Queensland. That is because tomorrow the government will release tender documents for the digitisation of six million records relating to Queensland’s births, deaths and marriages. This is another demonstration of the Bligh government keeping its promises and it fulfils a commitment made in last year’s budget when the government committed $20.8 million over five years to digitise paper records. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018356"></A>
This program of work will dramatically improve production times for any Queenslanders who apply for a birth, death or marriage certificate. It will also make it easier for genealogists, researchers and statistical agencies to get access to information and allow the department to introduce online ordering and payment facilities. The government’s invitation to offer for the births, deaths and marriages digitisation project will be released on the government’s e-tender website and advertised in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 and the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. The contract is expected to be awarded by the end of August 2010 to allow the successful tenderer to start by early October 2010 and continue over a period of four to five years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018358"></A>
Another significant milestone in relation to marriages also occurred this month, and that of course relates to the spectacular breakdown in the relationship between the Liberal National Party and the members for Burnett and Beaudesert. It is a symptom of a marriage in deep, deep trouble--a union that was doomed before the ink was dry on the marriage certificate. As honourable members know, I practised a bit of family law before I came into this place. I always tried to get clients to reconcile, to bring them together, but one thing I learnt was when a marriage was doomed, when the case was doomed and beyond hope. I recognised that early in my practise. And so it is with the Liberal National Party. The shotgun marriage, presided over by the good old boy, ‘Poppy McIver’, is falling apart under enormous pressure and the cracks are showing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018361"></A>
Some people, like the members for Burnett and Beaudesert, did not even wait until the end of the reception--they did not like the food; they did not like the music; they did not like the wine; they were out the door. What about the member for Moggill and his mates? They came along for a few drinks. They did not like the marriage but they had to come along anyway. They were out the back of the reception having a few red wines and someone in the bridal party dobbed them in! How is that for going into a marriage? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018362"></A>
We understand from today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 that the groom, the member for Surfers Paradise, is off overseas on a holiday. He is going on a honeymoon. I wish him all the best because while he is away the member for Southern Downs will get out the application for divorce. He has got the pen. He is going to be filling it out. He will be doing the numbers while the member for Surfers Paradise is overseas. He should enjoy the holiday because when he comes back the marriage will be well and truly over. There is one party that has a plan for this state--and that is the Australian Labor Party. This government will continue to do good things for Queensland while those opposite wallow in their own despair. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Transport. Why did the Queensland government allow the <Hansard-Italic>

 to be towed into the Hervey Bay Marine Park where it is surrounded by pristine waters? Will the minister guarantee that no damage will be caused to the environment or the wildlife? </Hansard-Body>

Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Queensland government wants to see the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng</Hansard-Italic>
 <Hansard-Italic>
1</Hansard-Italic>
 out of Queensland and Australian waters as soon as possible. The <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng</Hansard-Italic>
 <Hansard-Italic>
1</Hansard-Italic>
 went into Douglas Shoal it would seem as a result of a navigational error. The Queensland government, in cooperation with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has worked incredibly hard to recover this situation from that point in time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018376"></A>
A week ago, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority directed that the ship should move to Hervey Bay near Fraser Island so that the coal could be unloaded in order to facilitate the towing of the ship back to China from whence it came. That had to happen because the original plan to move the ship back to Gladstone for unloading was unable to be realised. What happened was that, once the ship came off the reef and was assessed as being structurally sound, it needed to get some of its coal off so that it could be towed that enormous distance. As I said, the original plan was to move it to Gladstone. But, when an effort was made to tow the ship into the port of Gladstone, five metal cables which are the size of a drainpipe snapped when being pulled by tug boats. That of course is incredibly dangerous to the people who are involved in the salvage effort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018377"></A>
So a decision was made that it was not safe to move the ship to Gladstone, and so the coal had to be removed while the ship remained at sea. Of course in order to do that, there needed to be calm, protected waters, and the safest place in the area where that could be done was Fraser Island. It was not the Queensland government that made the decision to move it to that place; it was the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, directing my agency Maritime Safety Queensland. We expect that removing the coal will take another week or so and then the ship will be able to be towed well and truly out of Queensland and Australian waters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021326"></A>
I am disappointed that the member questions those matters. They have been explained to him in great detail before. It is my view that Maritime Safety Queensland, under the leadership of Captain Patrick Quirk, has done strong, professional work in overseeing this delicate rescue operation. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to directed to the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. Can the minister please advise what the government is doing to ensure the protection of landholders’ rights in communities where coal seam gas exploration is taking place? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018390"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question and his ongoing interest in issues affecting particularly the south-west of this state as we address a range of issues arising out of the development of the coal seam gas to LNG industry in this state. As I have said earlier today, it is an industry that is important to the future of Queensland but, in terms of its development, that will not come at all costs. That is why later this week I will be introducing legislation to ensure that landholders’ rights are protected as we see the development of this industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018393"></A>
This week I will be introducing into the parliament a new land access framework which aims to provide certainty to all stakeholders about their respective rights and responsibilities when it comes to land access. This proposed new legislation will include a new land access code of conduct which will apply to the gas, mining and petroleum industries; a requirement for companies to notify landholders before entering land to conduct preliminary activities that do not require disturbance of the land; and a requirement for companies to negotiate an agreement about the conduct and compensation prior to coming on to a property to undertake larger scale activities that are likely to significantly impact upon the land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018395"></A>
A standard conduct and compensation agreement is also being developed for use by both parties--both mining companies and landholders--during their discussions to help guide negotiations. Our focus is on helping industry and communities to work together to build a stronger future for this state. As I said earlier in relation to a question asked by a member opposite, we are addressing a range of issues. Just recently there were allegations about well heads leaking methane into the atmosphere. As a result of that my department met with industry and an audit is underway across the whole state to ensure that those well heads are not leaking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018398"></A>
We have heard a lot about leaking recently. I think it is useful at this point in time to remind members what the member for Burnett had to say about leaking and his experience with the LNP which led to his resignation. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018400"></A>
It leaks like a sieve. So therefore the partyroom which should have been used for robust debate, wasn’t ... And that was one of the reasons for me why I saw it was going nowhere. Now, those leaks, and I’ve got to say I didn’t participate in them--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1018401"></A>
good on you--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1018402"></A>
but I know other people did participate in them and I believe the deputy leader participated in them for their own personal political gain. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018403"></A>
All members opposite should take those words very seriously because when it comes to political ambition the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows no bounds in terms of what he will do to each and every one of those opposite to advance his own agenda. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
My question is to the Attorney-General. In December last year the Queensland Court of Appeal set aside Graham Stafford’s conviction of murder on the grounds that there was a miscarriage of justice. I understand that there will be a new investigation of the case. I recently met with Graham Stafford. One of his priorities is to ensure that there will be an opportunity for present and former Queensland police officers to tell what they know about the case, with full indemnity to them, so that the truth of what happened almost 20 years ago can finally be told. My question is: will the minister meet with Mr Stafford and reassure him that this government will seek to redress the terrible miscarriage of justice? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
I thank the honourable member for his question. Before responding to the member’s question I would like to provide the House with a brief overview of this long-running matter. Firstly, the tragic death of Leanne Holland in 1991 shocked and saddened many Queenslanders. I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone in this parliament when I say that our hearts go out to Leanne’s family, friends and others known to her all these years on. Despite the passage of almost 20 years, I am sure the pain and hurt felt by her family is just as palpable as it was in 1991. This government has taken significant steps in recent years to ensure our justice system has greater regard for victims of crime, but that does not diminish in any way the impact that crime--particularly violent crime--has on families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021353"></A>
I am aware of the ongoing speculation and criticism about the nature of the initial police investigation into the death of Leanne Holland and claims made by Mr Stafford and his supporters about the veracity of the evidence presented at Mr Stafford’s trial. In 1992 Mr Stafford was convicted by a jury of the 1991 murder of Leanne Holland. Twice Mr Stafford took his case to the Queensland Court of Appeal and on neither occasion was an acquittal or a retrial directed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021355"></A>
In 2009, as the honourable member has noted, a third Court of Appeal ruling set aside Mr Stafford’s conviction and a new trial was ordered. In the lead judgement, written by Justice Keane, a highly respected jurist who has since been appointed the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, the Court of Appeal found that a procedural miscarriage of justice had occurred in Mr Stafford’s case rather than a substantive miscarriage of justice. It should also be noted that in his reasons for judgement Justice Keane also held that a jury ‘could, acting reasonably, find Mr Stafford guilty of the murder of the deceased’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021358"></A>
Subsequent to the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Director of Public Prosecutions announced, for various reasons, that he will not pursue a retrial of Mr Stafford. More recently, the Police Commissioner has announced a review of the investigation into Leanne Holland’s death. This will include the involvement of an experienced and highly respected investigator from New South Wales--Detective Inspector Mark Newnham. I also understand from reports in the media that Mr Stafford and his legal advisers are preparing a submission for presentation to government in respect of certain matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021360"></A>
As I have said publicly, I will give full and proper consideration to any submission I receive from Mr Stafford and his legal team. However, given the likelihood of a submission being made to government and the Police Service’s decision to review this case, it would be inappropriate, in my view, for me to meet with Mr Stafford at this time. However, I can reassure the honourable member that my mind is open on this case and if circumstances arise in the future that warrant meetings with the family of Leanne Holland and also Mr Stafford I would give them due consideration. Finally, if anyone has allegations or evidence of criminality or misconduct in relation to this matter, including the police investigation, they should refer them immediately to the Crime and Misconduct Commission for investigation. </Hansard-Body>

I thank the honourable member for the question. I am pleased to let the parliament know that, as the Minister for Local Government, I have been visiting local governments all over the state. I am yet to find one that is asking to be deamalgamated. None of them are asking for that--far from it. They are seeing the benefits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021366"></A>
I was recently in Gladstone. While I was there I met with the Gladstone Regional Council. I also met with the member for Gladstone. I was pleased to have her assistance in working with an Aboriginal group on a very exciting project that may benefit the Aboriginal people from the Gladstone area in years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021369"></A>
I met with the Gladstone Regional Council. I was accompanied by Deputy Mayor Gail Sellers on an inspection of the refurbished CBD. This is a $1.71 million project, half of it paid for by the state government through a local government grant. My heavens, what that has done for the main street of Gladstone. There is landscaping, outdoor furniture, artwork, seating, more entertainment and much more life. I am pleased to compliment the Gladstone Regional Council on its recognition that, while people might move to regional cities like Gladstone for jobs, it will be the lifestyle factors that determine how long they stay. The Gladstone Regional Council understands that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021372"></A>
I sat down with the council and talked with them about issues of concern to them--for example, the new Local Government Act and its implementation, the definition of ‘material personal interest’, how the council is going with the development of its new community plan, the need for a new local government electoral act, the boom that Gladstone is facing and the need to plan for the infrastructure that will be needed in the years ahead. So far as amalgamation is concern, Mayor George Creed is on the record saying that if it were possible to turn back the clock to pre amalgamation he would not do that because the benefits are already showing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021374"></A>
While I have been doing that, the opposition has been out and about Queensland promising deamalgamation where people want it and where they are unhappy with amalgamation. The leader was saying in Mossman and Port Douglas that he will listen to the community. Those opposite should come clean about Gladstone. Are they going to deamalgamate Gladstone? I call on the shadow minister to be really clear about this. There are disgruntled people in Gladstone who do not like amalgamation. What about them? Put them out of their uncertainty or tell them the truth. Are they going to unscramble the egg and at what cost in the City of Gladstone? The council has a huge task ahead of it with the growth in that important regional city. The shadow minister should come clean. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.58 am): I invite the Premier to come back and hear the answers to some of the questions she posed or wanted to pose to us in question time this morning. Of course, I am unable to answer those questions in that forum but I am happy to answer them now. That is what delineates this side of the House from that side of the House. There is honesty and integrity from this side of House. We answer questions upfront for the people of Queensland--unlike those opposite, who I notice will not stay to hear my answers. Let me answer some of the questions that have been posed by the Premier this morning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024371"></A>
How many MPs from our team were under preliminary investigation for issues pertaining to claims, allowances and performance? Two. How many of my current MPs are under preliminary investigation for issues pertaining to claims, allowances and performance? Zero. In answer to the question as to whether they were referred for preliminary investigation by my office or that of the deputy, no, they were not. Did I know that preliminary investigations were underway? Yes, I did. Why do I allow these preliminary investigations to be done at arm’s length from the parliamentary party? Because we have learned a lesson. From whom have we learned a lesson? We have learned a lesson from those corrupt Labor MPs opposite.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024374"></A>
We on this side do not form our own court and come into this House and exonerate our own members, as members opposite have done. Let us see what happens when a leader of the party sits in judgement of one of their own MPs. I remind this parliament of the most corrupt exoneration of an MP that has ever occurred in Queensland history. Let us remember December 2005--the day that this parliament was urgently recalled for a special sitting. Let us remember the day the now Premier seconded a motion to exonerate her corrupt cabinet friend Gordon Nuttall--the day that Labor MPs gathered in this House to sit in judgement of one of their own. Let us remember the corrupt actions of those who exonerated Gordon Nuttall and let a corrupt minister back into the community. Let us remember how the current Premier defended her friend as a decent person.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024378"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am happy to withdraw and make reference to the fact that, clearly, the member was exonerated for not telling the truth to a parliamentary estimates committee. Let us remember that the current Premier defended her friend as a decent person. Let us remember, and in doing so let us never forget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024380"></A>
My party undertakes preliminary investigations on all complaints. If those complaints reveal any hint of legal wrongdoing at the conclusion of the investigation, we refer that immediately to the appropriate authorities. We do not refer vexatious complaints to anyone, and the various authorities warn against vexatious complaints. But we do investigate, and if we believe that they are not vexatious then we refer them to the appropriate authority. That is the difference. That is the difference between Labor and the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024382"></A>
Let us all remember how the Premier personally stopped the Director of Public Prosecutions from pursuing Gordon Nuttall. That is Labor’s way. That is the corrupt way. That is the Premier’s way. In case Labor members opposite need other names to be reminded of with regard to whom they have judged amongst themselves, we have Gordon Nuttall, Keith Wright, Bill D’Arcy, Merri Rose and even Pat Purcell. On issues such as bullying, clearly the Premier exonerated Pat Purcell. They are the facts of the matter in this case. We do not resile from the proper way of doing these investigations. We do not investigate our own and then exonerate our own, as has been done in this case by the Labor Party.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024386"></A>
This morning we have seen on a number of issues where the state Labor government, the health minister and the Premier have been unable to stand up and do the things that they are supposed to do in state government. This morning we heard the Premier, in answer to my question about health workers being paid, saying that everyone knows that they will be paid on the day if they are not getting paid electronically, somehow implying that we are only asking about electronic payments. Wherever I have been over the last month, whether it is Mapoon--here I met a nurse who said that she is not taking jobs in Queensland anymore but is going to New South Wales because she has not been paid properly--Mossman, Ingham, Bundaberg, Weipa or Toowoomba, I and my MPs have received representations from constituents because this health minister, the member for Lytton, will not take responsibility for having brought in a payroll system on his watch that has cost up to $400 million across government but which is not delivering what it should, even though this government was warned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024387"></A>
This morning my other question to the Premier was whether the Premier is going to support Kevin Rudd in his new resource super profits tax. Very obviously, the Premier was not able to answer the question and would not answer the question. In fact, she implied that it is not actually a tax yet. Unless I am mistaken, Wayne Swan made sure his budget was based on this new tax--a tax with which he came up in order to deliver some spurious $1 billion surplus three or four years from now. He is trying to say that that is ahead of schedule--a schedule they only came up with last year when they could not fulfil the previous year’s schedule! If it were not so serious, it would be a big joke. The Premier said, ‘No, all the details of the tax are not actually finalised,’ implying that this might be a tax that would prevent her from fulfilling her 100,000 bread-winning jobs promise, and then the next day she said, ‘Maybe it will help us create more jobs.’ She is all over the shop. The Premier is saying that she cannot fulfil her bread-winning jobs promise and then saying that this new tax could help create more jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024388"></A>
But it was the Treasurer who belled the cat in his answer to the question from the shadow Treasurer about whether there would be other projects that might be affected. What did he say? The Treasurer said, ‘We will support Kevin Rudd’--again, not standing up for Queensland. Just as the government refused to stand up on health negotiations, now what do we find? We are going to lose 42 per cent of our GST revenue--the hard-won GST revenue, lost in the health negotiations--and now the government is rolling over again on the mining sector, which provides 40,000 jobs in this state and supports one in 12 of all jobs in Queensland. When are these people going to stand up for Queensland? Clearly they are not doing it now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024392"></A>
Of course, the Henry tax review is very obviously a lost opportunity. It was an excellent, detailed review with a pathetic, meagre response. To see this we only have to look at the fact that there were 125 taxes before that review and the recommendations from the government and subsequently we now have 126 taxes. There were 138 recommendations in the Henry tax review. What did the government adopt? Two and a half--a reworking of one, adding to another tax, and the state to be worst affected is Queensland. Meanwhile, the Premier and the Treasurer are fiddling whilst Rome is burning in not standing up for our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024394"></A>
I have a copy of the government’s submission to the Henry tax review. It calls for an end to the vertical fiscal imbalance between Canberra and Queensland. How often have we heard the Treasurer come in here and wax lyrical with all those words that no-one really understands but which show how intellectual he is--saying that we need to do something about this vertical fiscal imbalance that is affecting the federation? This of course is the Treasurer who in his maiden speech talked about getting rid of the GST. We do not hear too much of that anymore, but he is happy to give it away to Canberra.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024397"></A>
We are going to keep monitoring and pointing out Labor’s failure to budget. It says in its submission--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024398"></A>
Vertical fiscal imbalance weakens government accountability and reduces transparency.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024399"></A>
So there it is. The Labor government has finally admitted that it has serious problems with accountability and transparency. Just like every other Labor failure, it is someone else’s fault! Let us look at how the Rudd government’s response has failed Queensland. On 24 November 2009 the Premier said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024401"></A>
That is why I have written to the federal Treasurer ... about the Henry tax review and the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that it represents to put the levers of government to work in this regard.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024402"></A>
I have indicated to the federal Treasurer that decentralisation must be advanced through the tax reform process and I have indicated that the Prime Minister’s agenda for a big Australia should include incentives to support regional economies and encourage decentralisation. We need incentives for people to settle outside the south-east corner so that all parts of Queensland can enjoy the benefits that measured, sustainable growth can bring.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024403"></A>
What have we seen from the Prime Minister--the great friend of our Premier and another Queenslander? We were going to get a great advantage from having a Queensland Prime Minister and a Queensland Treasurer. There is nothing in the Prime Minister’s response that covers these points. The Prime Minister no longer supports a big Australia, because we are still waiting for him to announce what he has been told to think by Hawker Britton about this particular point. The federal Treasurer said--</Hansard-Body>

Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024444"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (12.09 pm): Like many thousands of Queenslanders, last Sunday I took part in the community open day to signify the opening of the $1.88 billion Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge. We have already seen the reports of the success of this day, with 175,000 people taking the opportunity to walk across the bridge before it is officially opened to traffic. I was so pleased to be able to walk with my nine-year-old daughter across the bridge and back for many reasons, including so that in 50 years time she can talk to her own children and grandchildren about having been part of that day in history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024446"></A>
The twin Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges comprise the country’s biggest road and bridge project. With 2,000 people moving to Queensland each week, the bridge upgrade, completed six months ahead of schedule and ahead of budget, signifies some of the most important things the state government is doing to provide for Queenslanders. It is one of the major tranches of the government’s $18 billion infrastructure program--a plan that the government has been determined to complete despite strong opposition from those opposite--to make sure that Queensland is ready for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024447"></A>
 Put simply, the new bridge will make a big difference to people’s lives. Completing the second bridge was about easing congestion in our rapidly growing region and slashing travel times for the 200,000 motorists who are expected to drive across the bridges. It was about planning for and managing growth. It was about generating jobs for workers in road construction and related industries at a time when jobs and job security were more important than ever, creating in its time between 5,000 and 6,000 direct and indirect jobs for workers. In line with its mantle of changing transport infrastructure in South-East Queensland, the project reflects the state government’s visionary approach of ensuring that active transport options are incorporated within all our major new road infrastructure, with a pedestrian walkway and cycleway constructed to span the bridge. The walkway and cycleway will be opened in June, reinforcing the government’s commitment to providing viable options to Queenslanders to reduce their carbon footprint and to lead active and healthy lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024448"></A>
Construction of the bridge also ticks all the boxes in terms of green space. With its draft Greenspace Strategy out for consultation, the Bligh government has already signalled its commitment to preserving and creating more green space so that we can guarantee the quality of life that we now enjoy and to which we all continue to aspire. Underneath the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge a whole new area of green space is already starting to happen. Queensport Rocks Park will provide green space for the community, with parking, picnic benches, bike racks, lawns, interpretative signage, a natural amphitheatre and memorial plaques. The park’s name dates back to the early 1900s, when rocks were removed from the southern banks of the Brisbane River to widen the river so that vessels could make their way up the river. I know that the local community had a big say in this park, with groups such as the Murarrie Progress Association, the Bulimba Creek Catchment Committee and the Riverside Lions Club being actively involved in the consultation on the naming and all other aspects of the park’s development. I also know that the Gateway project team has worked closely with the local community on ways to the protect the local environment. The Gateway project team specifically enlisted the expertise of the Bulimba Creek Catchment Committee, which already does so much in the local area, to plant thousands of saplings, including an endangered species that was discovered during clearing, alongside the motorway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024454"></A>
The good news about the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge will continue to roll out for the rest of this year. After nearly four years of construction, 12 kilometres of upgrade south of the river are nearing completion. From next week motorists will have four lanes on the second bridge and the structure will be fully opened by August. The staged opening of lanes will continue until December, when all six northbound and six southbound lanes will come on line and works are completed on the bridge’s approach roads. Motorists will get the benefits of those extra lanes as soon as they are ready. Every extra lane means that an extra 1,400 vehicles an hour can cross the river and motorists will be able to save up to 25 minutes on their journeys. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024455"></A>
It was wonderful to have a sneak preview of the bridge last week with some of the children from Murarrie State School who had helped to prepare the murals that decorated the bridge for the walk of art for the open day. The school was one of only 11 schools that were asked to contribute to the open day in this way. Perhaps more than most other students, given the close proximity of Murarrie to the bridge, Lara Straughair, Megan Thiesfield, Robert Miles, and teacher aide Debbie Hollanby felt a special sense of ownership over the structure. As members of the local community, their families saw the first bridge through all its construction phases and now they have lived through all the construction phases of this bridge. I know that they, along with the majority of residents in the Bulimba electorate, which borders the Gateway, are grateful for the huge difference the structure will make in reducing traffic congestion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024460"></A>
The bridge is a huge feat for all concerned. I congratulate the Premier, the Deputy Premier, who started the ball rolling on the new bridge, and the Minister for Main Roads for delivering this most important piece of infrastructure for South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Beenleigh and Logan Indigenous Communities</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024463"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (12.14 pm): Our state is fortunate to have strong leadership among our Indigenous community. This is no more evident than in the Beenleigh and Logan communities. The local traditional elders and community elders in those areas play an important role. The people of the town of Beenleigh have a strong sense of belonging and Indigenous elders have taken a strong leadership role. Traditional owners such as Auntie Eileen Williams and Auntie Robyn Williams actively represent their Indigenous community to their local MPs, Margaret Keech and me, ensuring that the government is delivering better services for their community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024467"></A>
But Beenleigh’s Indigenous community has taken that role to the world stage. In April this year, Beenleigh-raised Megan Davis became the first Australian Indigenous woman to be elected to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. I congratulate federal minister Jenny Macklin, as this is the first time the Australian government has nominated an Indigenous person to a UN body. I also congratulate the Australian government for recognising the depth of talent that exists in Beenleigh and its Indigenous community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024471"></A>
Although Megan was nominated by the Australian government, she will serve on the permanent forum as an independent expert. Megan is a world-leading scholar on Indigenous legal rights and international law. She is the director of the Indigenous Law Centre of the University of New South Wales and has been active in the United Nations as an advocate for Indigenous rights, particularly for women. Megan’s nomination also received broad international support. She received the highest number of votes in her group in the election by members of the UN’s Economic and Social Council. The permanent forum is the pre-eminent UN body on Indigenous matters. It is encouraging to see that since 2007 we have had an Australian government that is actively engaging in supporting Indigenous people on the world stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024475"></A>
But Megan is not alone in showing the achievements of Beenleigh’s Davis family. Megan’s sister, Lucy Banu, has served the Beenleigh Indigenous community through Beenleigh Housing and Development for a number of years and she is now working with the Red Cross on Indigenous employment programs in Queensland. John Davis has been a leader in Indigenous education both in Logan and across Queensland. John started the Knowledge House program at Loganlea State High School which provides high-quality education and support for Indigenous students at the school. Loganlea State High School has a strong record of supporting Indigenous education and proudly displays an Indigenous uniform for Indigenous students. The only downside of John’s success for Logan is that he has now taken a role with the Indigenous Education Leadership Institute under the executive director, Dr Chris Sarra. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024482"></A>
 The Davis family is a great success story for the Beenleigh community and, in particular, our Indigenous community. Dawn Davis raised her four children--Megan, John, Lucy and William--in a three-bedroom department of housing property at Eagleby. All four Davis children were educated at Trinity College in Beenleigh--a school that has made great efforts in supporting Indigenous recognition in its own right. I congratulate Dawn and the Davis family on years of achievement. Dawn and her achieving children provide great role models for Indigenous students in Beenleigh and highlight their future potential. Their efforts can only serve to lift the aspirations of local Indigenous young people and provide an example of the opportunities that education can provide young Indigenous Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024490"></A>
Another shining example of this strength is Beenleigh’s Yugambeh Museum Language and Heritage Research Centre. The museum tells the ongoing Yugambeh story, which defines the spiritual traditions of the Yugambeh people, presenting them in the spirt of our shared history through education programs, exhibitions and ceremonies. The Yugambeh museum, under the leadership of Rory O’Connor and the Yugambeh elders, was recognised with a Gallery and Museum Achievement Award. The museum is well known for its resources for the teaching of school students but the museum also actively engages with the community through public events, such as the Drumley Walk and the Black Diggers Remembrance Ceremony. Beenleigh as a community is proud of its Indigenous community and the leadership they provide not only for the Indigenous community but also for the community at large. This is one of those opportunities to celebrate the achievements of our locals and to look forward with hope to closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage, whether that be in urban communities or in remote Queensland communities. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024497"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (12.18 pm): Today we heard the health minister state that Queensland Health has a $6 billion construction budget and also a $9 billion budget in the 2009-10 year. On many occasions the minister has stated that we live in a time of an ageing population and a rise in chronic disease. But I can tell members this: it does not matter how much money you have or how much money you spend or what you build, unless you deliver the outcomes for the people you represent that money is completely wasted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024498"></A>
The last occasion on which we received a report card on the outcomes of Queensland Health was last Friday when the March 2010 quarterly hospital report was made available. To say the least, the figures in that report are absolutely appalling. On 1 April 2010, there were 4,746 Queenslanders waiting too long for category 1 and category 2 elective surgery procedures. Twelve months ago, that figure was 3,361--an increase of 41 per cent in 12 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024539"></A>
The waiting list to get on the waiting list--that is, people who are waiting to see an outpatient specialist--now stands at 199,457, an increase of almost 20,000 from a year ago. Access block continues to rise in this state with 34 per cent of all patients in EDs across Queensland having to wait more than eight hours before admission to a bed. Three months ago it was 32 per cent. The government’s answer to all of this is to hand over the running of our health system to Kevin Rudd and the federal government, a government that could not put a pink batt in a roof and could not build a building on time or in real budget terms. The situation is that this government is prepared to hand over 42 per cent of the GST to a man who has failed over and over again to implement any real policy of benefit to this nation. Kevin Rudd has a litany of promises and a litany of nil results. We now have the super profit tax that is raping money out of the hands of Queenslanders to satisfy his need to plug the holes that he has made in his budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024540"></A>
There is more than that in relation to the health portfolio. Twelve months ago the dental waiting list was 102,687; it now stands at 105,277. Ambulance ramping across the state 12 months ago stood at 10 per cent; it is now at 12 per cent. Twelve months ago all of our Queensland Health staff were being paid. Now we do not know how many of our Queensland Health staff are being paid, what they are being paid and whether they are able to meet their daily commitments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024541"></A>
The minister can stand in this House day after day and proclaim a building budget and that the budget figures are going up and up each year, but every single year these reports disclose a situation that is becoming more and more desperate and a position that is more and more in crisis. Nowhere is it more so than in Nambour Hospital. In April this year we had 480 people waiting too long for category 1 and category 2 elective surgery procedures. Twelve months ago that figure was 258. We now have access ramping in Nambour Hospital whereby one half of all patients have to wait more than eight hours to get into a bed from the ED. That is up from 44 per cent three months ago. In January 2008, five per cent of patients were waiting more than 30 minutes; now it is 19 per cent. This minister sits here day after day proclaiming what this government has done, yet the facts published by his own department over the past 12 months, two years, three years and four years show that this situation is getting worse and worse. The results are not driven by dollars; the results are driven by listening to doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, talking to the AMAQ and talking to other bodies that know what goes on in our hospital system--and not simply spouting rhetoric. It is no longer good enough for this government to claim it is turning the corner. The figures prove that it has not done that. As a result of ramping and access block people are dying in our hospitals. The most recent example is the alleged death by way of those instances at Nambour Hospital. That situation is currently under investigation. It is this government that should be under investigation for its neglect of the Queensland health system. </Hansard-Body>

Mareeba Hospital</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024544"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.23 pm): The Mareeba Hospital is a central and important part of that community. The people there are determined to see facilities and services constantly improved. Mareeba came back into the Cook electorate following the last redistribution. I am determined to work with that community to assist it to achieve that goal. The strength of the community’s feelings on this matter can be felt from a non-conforming petition that I tabled today of 2,113 citizens who are calling on the Premier and Deputy Premier to ensure that the hospital is capable of properly servicing the Mareeba community. The petition was organised and driven by the <Hansard-Italic>
Tablelands Advertiser</Hansard-Italic>
, the local newspaper. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024545"></A>
Over the last couple of years there have been some important improvements to service delivery at the hospital. The establishment of a new senior medical officer and principal house officer has increased the hospital’s medical workforce to eight doctors. I understand that some additional administrative support has been provided to reduce the workload of nurses. The operational budget for the hospital has increased by over $4 million in the last four years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024546"></A>
From the outset I want to be clear that no-one is critical of the work that is performed at the hospital by the doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and staff. In fact, people are overwhelmingly happy with the treatment they get at that hospital. The midwife model of maternity care in particular is popular with women, many of whom travel from Mossman and up from Cairns to have their babies under this system. I firmly believe this model can be rolled out to other areas of regional Queensland such as Cooktown and Weipa. Similarly, the coordinated services for people with chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal diseases is a success story. This has been introduced in collaboration with the local GPs and Mulungu Aboriginal Health Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024547"></A>
A continuing bugbear for the community of Mareeba remains the west wing of the hospital which was refurbished over two years ago and remains unused. There is a strong sense that this ward should be opened and used to deliver additional services to Mareeba and the region. To that end Queensland Health has begun a study of the future health needs of the Tablelands, including planning for Mareeba and Atherton hospitals. Architects have been appointed and site visits to assess the current infrastructure of the two hospitals are scheduled to commence this year. The study, which is due to be completed this year, will identify the complementary roles of services and facilities provided at Mareeba and Atherton as well as the infrastructure, information and communications technology and workforce requirements to provide safe health service delivery in the area. The planning work at Atherton and Mareeba is part of broader health service planning being undertaken across the state to identify the renewal needs for rural and remote services. The initial service planning will drive what work needs to be done at the Mareeba and Atherton hospitals. The focus will be on improved services, avoiding duplication and getting the best value out of taxpayers’ dollars. The analysis will focus on future demand for health services in the area. The results will then feed into the way we safely deliver those services in terms of the health workforce and our hospitals and clinics. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024548"></A>
Not only will there be public consultation but the views of doctors and other health workers will be sought. This is necessary so that we can determine the requirements of the Mareeba and Atherton hospitals caused by both growing demand and the need to provide better services. For example, what would be the scope of the new or expanded services? Do we need to change the emphasis of the services that we deliver from one specialist area to another? From looking at demand and the need for new or expanded services, the staff and hospital infrastructure requirements can be established. It would be irresponsible and potentially very wasteful to go ahead with work on the physical infrastructure such as the two hospitals without doing this detailed planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024549"></A>
I was very pleased that the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, Paul Lucas, took time out from the recent community cabinet meeting at Mareeba to visit the hospital to inspect the facilities and to meet the staff. Not long after the visit surgery outreach services were reinstated at the hospital. This means that patients can now receive minor keyhole surgery such as skin cancer excisions and hernia operations that do not require complex anaesthetic support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024550"></A>
There are a couple of matters that are putting pressure on the Mareeba Hospital. Mareeba has a growing population but it is also an ageing one. While some additional beds have been allocated to the nearby nursing home by the Australian government these are yet to be brought on line. This means that at any one time up to one-third of occupied beds at the hospital are taken up by people who should be in aged-care facilities. Problems at the hospital are also made worse by the fact that the last bulk-billing doctor recently left the town. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024551"></A>
I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the service planning by Queensland Health, but it is my view that renal dialysis services should be introduced at the west wing of the Mareeba Hospital. I understand that most of the patients have to travel from Mareeba to Atherton so it only makes sense that this service operates from Mareeba. Of course, the community and hospital staff may have different ideas which is why it is important for people to take the opportunity to have their say during the consultation phase of the service planning. </Hansard-Body>

LNP Charter of Property Rights</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.28 pm): I would like to present to parliament a policy on protecting prime agricultural land. In so doing I would like to thank the honourable member for Warrego, Howard Hobbs, and his staff and also my staff for putting this together. An LNP government will entrench in law a charter of property rights that will legally guarantee the rights of private property owners whether they are householders in an urban area or primary producers in a rural area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024555"></A>
The charter will ensure that all government policy related to land and water rights is based on science and not politics or hearsay. The charter will legally enshrine compensation for landholders whose pre-existing rights are diminished as a result of government policy. This will include a right to a fully funded independent valuation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027867"></A>
An LNP government will spearhead the development of world-leading agricultural produce, focusing on food security at home and permanently cementing an international reputation for clean, green food. We will precision target new and emerging markets and invest in precise future mapping of global demands and trends in the food market. An LNP government will establish an independent commission for future foods and fibre to advise the government on priority investment areas and strategic targeting of new, growing and emerging market opportunities. The commission will consist of grower and industry representatives and the science community in conjunction with representatives from Trade Queensland and the research and development arms of the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027871"></A>
Food security, economic security, environmental security, biosecurity and national security are all dependent on Australia protecting prime agricultural land, protecting our ability to produce competitively on domestic and international markets and protecting our ability to truly deliver on a ‘buy Australian’ campaign and withstand a flood of inferior imported produce and the associated disease risk. The LNP government made a commitment in March 2009 that it would protect prime agricultural land from mining. The LNP recognises the long-term need to preserve prime farmland for continued agriculture throughout Queensland from mining, urban development and other incompatible uses. Government identifies land and waters from national parks based on their pristine environmental value. Governments create industrial reserves based on their suitability for industry, and governments gazette and legislate for vast tracts of land to be set aside for development purposes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027873"></A>
Similarly, the LNP believes in the protection of prime agricultural land. We believe that the most productive agricultural land should be scientifically identified, be off limits to mining and reserved exclusively for agricultural production. In government, the LNP will differentiate top quality agricultural land from other good quality agricultural land which may be considered for compatible purposes. These lands should be classed as category 1 strategic cropping. Just as it is unlawful to consider applications to clear vegetation in areas mapped as remnant vegetation, so too should it be unlawful to consider applications for open-cut mines on lands identified as top quality agricultural lands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027875"></A>
Transparency and public confidence in understanding the impact that coal seam gas and the underground coal gasification industries are having on our water supplies is paramount. The Queensland government has failed to invest in proper research, which is not only alarming to some sectors of the agricultural industry but also has the potential to be harmful to the perception of the coal seam gas industry, which offers new and growing economic opportunities for our state. The LNP believes that no individual, group or community should have their water access or reliability negatively affected by coal seam gas or underground coal gasification development. If it does occur, there must be an absolute obligation to ensure that they do not suffer loss and that their interests are repaired.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027876"></A>
The LNP supports the establishment of a rural water advisory panel, which will include community involvement through a community reference panel in the monitoring and reporting of any impacts the coal seam gas industry is having on aquifers and river systems along with issues surrounding the subsequent use of ponded water. The panel will make recommendations based on science on the future use of ponded water, its suitability to be treated and affordably purchased for irrigation and urban use, and the future potential for it to be re-injected into existing groundwater supplies. The panel will work in partnership with the coal seam gas industry and the agricultural sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027878"></A>
The LNP recognises that many areas of Queensland are experiencing massive growth in population and pressure on existing infrastructure due to the growth and opportunities from the resource sector. Despite these growing pains, the growth in the resource sector represents not only a great opportunity for Queensland but, properly managed, it also represents a great opportunity for regional centres and communities across the state. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

Under Labor however, the enormous revenue generated from the resource industries in regional Queensland is not being re-invested in our communities. An $85 billion debt coupled with the loss of Queensland’s once cherished AAA credit-rating means that more money than ever before is being eaten up in massive interest payments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1030981"></A>
The LNP believes that growing our economy is the best way to start paying-off the generational debt that Labor has left all Queenslanders and future Queenslanders; and we believe that the best way to grow our economy is to ensure our regions share in a meaningful investment into their communities--not just for services and infrastructure, but long-term investment that ensures our regional communities have the best opportunity to develop economic resilience and adaptability to meet the challenges of the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1030982"></A>
To underpin its Resourcing the Regions platform, the LNP will undertake precise economic modelling, to be published as a part of its first State Budget, on the flow of mining royalties to ensure all Queenslanders, no matter where they live, benefit from the wealth generated from the resource sector. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (12.33 pm): My electorate is nestled close to some of the most spectacular environmental assets in South-East Queensland. When you live in the electorate of Capalaba you can take a five-minute drive in the morning to launch your boat into Moreton Bay, the best marine park in the world within a cooee of a state capital city. In the afternoon you can take a walk and only a stone’s throw away you are assured to find parks, green space and wildlife. In fact, close to my office is the Capalaba Regional Park where, on occasion, you can spot a koala and, if you are really lucky, a mother and a baby. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Koalas are close to the hearts of the people in the Redlands and we have the largest population of koalas in South-East Queensland. We are proud of the fact that, while some people will only ever see a koala at a zoo or an animal sanctuary, this Australian icon is part and parcel of our neighbourhood. However, the sad fact is that koalas are under threat. So what has led to the decline of koalas? In a word, us. DERM reports that more than 330 koalas are being killed each year because they are hit by motor vehicles. Approximately 110 koalas are taken to hospital because of dog attacks and koalas also face threats from the impacts of disease. But by far the greatest threat to koalas is loss of habitat. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027892"></A>
In South-East Queensland there is no doubt that urgent action is required to halt the decline of our koala population. That is why last Saturday the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, Kate Jones, and the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, Sterling Hinchliffe, launched another koala planning instrument. For the first time, South-East Queensland has a powerful planning instrument that bans developers from clearing bushland koala habitat in priority koala habitat areas. The new state planning regulatory provisions will deal with irresponsible planning, which has occurred in some places in the past. The new SPRP can now override existing local planning schemes so that koala habitat must be taken into account. In addition, a new state planning policy, or SPP, will place the primary responsibility for conserving local koala populations on councils through their planning schemes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027895"></A>
The state government makes this decision in response to overwhelming feedback from councils that they were best placed to tailor localised solutions if given appropriate direction. The new state planning provisions will prevent developers from clearing bushland habitat, where koalas are under the most immediate threat, particularly in the Koala Coast which includes the Redlands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027896"></A>
The provisions will also require developers to avoid clearing areas mapped as medium and high value rehabilitation habitat. At times where clearing is unavoidable, habitat loss is to be offset by the ratio of five to one. This means that clearing one tree in an area mapped as medium or high value must result in a replanting of five trees in the same local government area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027897"></A>
The state planning policy will, for the first time, also require council planning schemes to identify and protect significant areas of koala habitat value and retain and enhance habitat connectivity using the koala habitat value maps and other information and also to maximise koala safety and movement through design and layout of development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027898"></A>
For some time I have been lobbying both Minister Jones and Minister Hinchliffe to strengthen planning laws in the Redlands to safeguard koalas. I have made clear to them the dangers that face koalas in the Redlands. I think the new planning instruments are a long-term win for the Redlands. They are also a win for the Redland City Council, which has demonstrated leadership in planning to protect koalas and their efforts have been recognised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027899"></A>
To accompany the new planning instruments, the Queensland government’s $15 million Koala Habitat Protection and Rehabilitation Strategy will help guard against habitat loss to give our koalas a fighting chance. The government has also moved to protect others and make the urban environment safer through a number of measures, which include retrofitting hot spots on state controlled main roads with wildlife crossings and underpasses and the release of a model local law for councils to help reduce dog attacks on koalas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027902"></A>
I would like to thank Minister Jones and Hinchliffe for their hard work. I think there have been some great results for our community. A property near my electorate of Capalaba has been chosen as the very first important acquisition for the government under this strategy. I was pleased to join my colleagues Ministers Jones and Hinchliffe last weekend to help plant a few trees at this property. I hope these measures will help our koala population and ensure that in the future our grandchildren can go for a walk in the afternoon and continue to spot a few koalas.  </Hansard-Body>

Building the Education Revolution</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027941"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (12.38 pm): The BER program to build school buildings across Australia is one of the largest public works expenditures in this nation’s history, costing $16 billion across Australia and over $2 billion in Queensland. One can only describe it as a bitter disappointment as it has been bungled like the home insulation scheme. This has been a lost opportunity, as a sensational amount of money has been made available to education but it has delivered so little. The outrageous rorts in this scheme are now well documented and they continue to be revealed on a weekly basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027942"></A>
I want to talk about something that every homeowner and home builder in Queensland understands, which is the estimate of the cost of building a building. A publication called <Hansard-Italic>
Rawlinsons</Hansard-Italic>
 continually updates the cost of building every sort of building one could imagine. I have looked at a copy of <Hansard-Italic>
Rawlinsons</Hansard-Italic>
 and it covers building things such as homes, home units, factories and all sorts of commercial buildings. <Hansard-Italic>
Rawlinsons</Hansard-Italic>
 contains a chapter for school halls and school gymnasiums. It is updated according to the actual costs that private schools, P&amp;Cs and so on pay to build those sorts of facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027943"></A>
What does it cost to build a school hall in Australia? All up, it is around $1,500 a square metre up to a maximum of $1,600 a square metre. That is all up. That includes all the fees, all the contingencies, all the planning and all the approvals. I have had the rare privilege to see individual costings of some Queensland projects, and every one costs at least $3,000 a square metre. I understand that many are up to the outrageous figure of $5,000 a square metre. <Hansard-Italic>
Rawlinsons</Hansard-Italic>
 is a respected publication used by the construction industry in this country. When the head of <Hansard-Italic>
Rawlinsons</Hansard-Italic>
 was asked why his researchers would disregard the cost of any school hall built under this program, his response was, ‘Insanity comes in many different forms.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027945"></A>
There has been no serious effort by the state government--or the federal government--to contain the costs and get value for money for Queensland, or to deliver what our schools actually need. <Hansard-Italic>
Rawlinsons</Hansard-Italic>
 has disregarded what we pay to build school halls because it is so aberrant and so much above industry norms. Private schools have delivered their projects at that sort of cost. We have seen $1.78 billion allocated to eight managing contractors with no tenders. Those eight managing contractors enjoy regular hospitality visits with the Queensland government at sporting events in Queensland and many of them are donors to the ALP. They negotiated an outrageous six per cent fee when the industry standard is two per cent and they negotiated the same fee for each of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027946"></A>
Both the federal and state governments have ordered numerous reviews and gone out of their way to ensure that none of those reviews looks at the issue of value for money. The federal Auditor-General did a review but was not given information on the costing of any individual project. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is another company that is a frequent guest of the Queensland government at sporting events and the like, was asked to look at the processes but never asked to look at the cost of individual programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027948"></A>
We see rorts such as the allocation of $194 million across Australia for buildings to be finished on time, when normally a penalty would apply if that did not happen. We see massive contingencies--hundreds of millions of dollars in Queensland--that there is no accountability for. That money belongs to the taxpayers, but there is no auditing of where cost overruns have eaten it up. We see design and planning of hundreds of millions of dollars. On occasion, $60,000 has been charged for something that would cost $3,000 in the open market. At Brookfield State School, tens of thousands of dollars was spent on planning, yet the planners never realised there is no sewerage in Brookfield. We have built a school hall that cannot be used because there is no capacity to hook up the toilets. I understand that there are many more such cases in the state. </Hansard-Body>

Solar Energy</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027952"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (12.44 pm): Like many thousands of Queenslanders, I am doing the bright thing. I am eagerly awaiting the installation of a grid connected solar PV system at my home in Narangba so that I, too, can be a part of the virtual solar system being built by people all around Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027953"></A>
The Queensland government is serious about being a world leader in large scale solar energy production and utilisation. I am pleased that many thousands of Queenslanders want to also play their part. We all take pride in the fact that Queensland is renowned for its sunshine. Queensland’s fantastic sunshine lifestyle is one of the factors that makes our state such a great place to live. By investing in solar energy production and utilisation projects and by encouraging Queenslanders to do the same, the Queensland government is delivering on its commitment to make Queensland the solar state. I have been contacted by many people of the Morayfield state electorate who are interested in helping transform Queensland into the solar state. Those people want to do the bright thing, but they also want to reduce their electricity consumption and, accordingly, save money on their electricity bills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027954"></A>
I take this opportunity to inform members of the House and Queenslanders more generally about the key initiatives being offered by the Queensland government to encourage Queenslanders to be a part of the government’s solar state transformation strategy. The Solar Bonus Scheme is providing eligible and participating Queenslanders with grid connected solar PV power systems a credit of 44c per kilowatt hour for all surplus electricity fed into the power grid. This scheme is providing a financial incentive to energy users to install solar PV power systems. I am pleased that increasing numbers of people in the Morayfield state electorate are taking up this offer. Those people are already doing the bright thing. Those people are already saving the environment and saving money on their electricity bills, and they are helping to transform Queensland into the solar state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027955"></A>
The new Queensland Solar Hot Water Rebate is also helping eligible Queenslanders do the bright thing. The new Queensland Solar Hot Water Rebate provides eligible Queenslanders with a financial incentive to switch their current electric hot-water system to a solar hot-water system. In addition to any rebates and incentives offered by the federal government, eligible Queensland pensioners and low-income earners can now apply for a $1,000 rebate and all other eligible Queenslanders can apply for a $600 rebate for a solar hot-water system or heat pump system. Combined with the rebates and incentives offered by the federal government, eligible householders are now able to save up to $3,300 off the cost of a new solar hot-water system. Not only will this new rebate system encourage the take-up of solar hot-water systems around Queensland; it will also encourage competition between suppliers and between installers of solar hot-water systems. This competition will further support the growth of the solar industry in Queensland. By doing the bright thing and changing to solar hot water, not only can households save money on their electricity bills but also they are helping to save our environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027956"></A>
The Queensland government is also helping to support local sporting and community groups with the installation of solar hot-water systems and solar PV power systems by asking the Gambling Community Benefit Fund to prioritise solar applications. This is just another way that the Queensland government is making sure Queensland’s not-for-profit community and sporting groups can do the bright thing and generate ongoing savings for their groups in the form of savings on their electricity bills. It is estimated that switching to solar will mean that those Queensland community organisations will collectively save up to $245,000 each year in electricity costs. Those collective savings mean that those organisations have more money to do the things that they are good at. They have more money to support members of their sporting organisations and they have more money to support their community. I also understand that this switch will help avoid approximately 1.2 gigawatt hours of electricity consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 1,300 tonnes per annum. This priority program is good news for community groups both now and into the future. It will help those organisations do the bright thing. </Hansard-Body>

The Queensland government is serious about being a world leader in solar energy production and utilisation. I encourage all people in the Morayfield state electorate to do the bright thing and help make Queensland the solar state. </Hansard-Body>

Irrigation Drilling</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031100"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (12.48 pm): When people go into business there are many things that they should do. Recently a young couple came to me with regard to their entering into an irrigation drilling business. Like all people, they did their due diligence. They did the research--the need for the service, the viability of the service, the sustainability of the service. But, most importantly, they asked a government body the relevant question: was anything going to change in the near future? I would like to read the letter I have just received from them. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031101"></A>
Dear Dorothy </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031102"></A>
We bought an irrigation drilling rig on December 30th 2009 which we got a loan for, mortgaging our house and borrowing close to--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1031103"></A>
and I am paraphrasing this--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031104"></A>
$100,000. Mostly the money went on the rig. We spent money on insurances, registrations et cetera. We also purchased a truck to carry the steel casings which we also purchased. We have placed ads in newspapers, made business cards, registered our business name, as well as GST registered. So all in all we were ready for business. But it was just on 10 weeks later on 19 January 2010 we got these documents to say that all our target area for irrigation drilling are no longer allowed and no new bores are to be put down. We went into shock immediately. The drilling rig is a cable tools rig which means we can only do irrigation bores, not stock bores like a rotary rig can. We have had to turn work away because of the new laws that have been put in place. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031105"></A>
When we first started the process, as I told you earlier, we needed to be assured that there would be no impediments to the business success. So we rang the Department of Environment and Water Resources on the 29th of October 2009 and asked if there were any plans at all, any new regulations, that we would need to be mindful of. The man from the Bundaberg office said there was nothing happening, nothing at all. After this conversation I went back to the loans manager and said that everything was fine and it looked like we could proceed. After the purchase of the rig, the man who sold us the rig then rang the department when he got his letter and said, ‘Why were we not told before that this was going to occur?’ The answer he received was that the reason they were not told before was because all the drillers would have gone off and started a large amount of drilling before the date of the moratorium. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031106"></A>
So here we are now with a rig that we are left to pay off at over $1,000 a month for over 15 years and no work for it. My husband had a fine job. He gave it up to go into this business. I went to the bank last week and asked them for help. There was none to be had. If we had been informed that something was going to be put in place, that would have affected our decision. We would not have proceeded down this path. We are in a mess through no fault of our own because we were given misinformation. Is there some way that the government can help us out now because we are really struggling and we are set to lose our home. We have a rig for sale but it is very unlikely now that it could ever be sold. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031107"></A>
The rig seller is quite happy to attest to the fact that he spoke to the department and it said, ‘No, we could not tell you because drillers would have dug a lot more bores.’ The bank is quite happy to say, ‘Yes, the couple did do the research.’ There is nothing left for this couple to drill. There is nothing to save their future, but the information was misrepresented to them. I cannot believe that the department did not tell the Bundaberg office what was going to happen, that the moratorium was coming. At the very least, people could have been told, ‘There has been a whisper. I would hold off a little longer.’ Something could have been done. But, because of the failure to divulge information when it was requested, this young couple with a very young family are about to lose their home. It is a disgraceful situation. I ask the government: what can it do to help this young couple and others like them? </Hansard-Body>

Fitzgibbon Chase</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031110"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DARLING</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Sandgate--ALP) (12.54 pm): Just over 12 months ago on 5 May 2009 I joined Premier Anna Bligh and Infrastructure and Planning Minister Stirling Hinchliffe to witness the turning of the sod to mark the official start of work on a state-of-the-art new residential development on Brisbane’s north side. The Fitzgibbon Chase development is the realisation of one part of the Bligh government’s Housing Affordability Strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031113"></A>
The Urban Land Development Authority is working quickly and effectively to turn a greenfield site into a liveable and sensitively designed suburban landscape with parks, recreation space and a variety of affordable housing options for Queensland families. Bringing houses to market quickly has enabled sensible price setting for properties, and two-thirds of properties in the Fitzgibbon development will be offered at or below the median house price for Brisbane. Currently 83 per cent of homes in Fitzgibbon Chase have been sold at or below the current Brisbane median price of $448,000. The average price for a Fitzgibbon Chase house and land package is $397,919. Builder partners Ausbuild, Aushomes and AV Jennings have commenced construction on homes in stages 1 and 2. All 72 house and land packages within stages 1 to 4 have already sold out, as well as a number of small and attached homes, including seven ‘Fonzie’ flats, which sell for just under $200,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031118"></A>
Construction on Brisbane Housing Co.’s development is well underway. I toured the site recently with federal housing minister Tanya Plibersek and federal member for Petrie, Yvette D’Ath. The complex will provide 64 one- and two-bedroom units for people on low to moderate incomes. Fitzgibbon Chase is providing jobs, apprenticeships and traineeships for hundreds of Queenslanders. I thank Yvette D’Ath for her tremendous support of this project. Both the federal and state governments have helped fund additional apprenticeship and traineeship programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031122"></A>
The ‘Fitz Blitz’ project used apprentices to construct the sales and information centre over a 24-hour period. East Coast Apprenticeships provided a great team of apprentices for the challenge which showcased the range of skills our construction industry apprentices have. A group of first, second, third and fourth year apprentices had spent the preceding 15 weeks prefabricating the building at Brendale before dismantling it and rebuilding it on site at Fitzgibbon Chase. The project provided the apprentices with 4,440 hours of work experience to go towards their final qualifications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031125"></A>
Minister Stirling Hinchliffe and I launched another program which will benefit young people in the electorate of Sandgate. The Fitzgibbon Industry Relevant Schools Training, or FIRST, program will provide some great learning opportunities for local school students. Students from Bracken Ridge State High School have already started on-site training with one of the ULDA’s builder partners, and students from Sandgate and Aspley high schools and Aspley Special School are due to start work shortly. I am pleased that local people are given the opportunity to benefit from development in their area, and I know that parents appreciate their children having such practical work experience close to home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031130"></A>
The new Fitzgibbon Chase sales and information centre is now open to the public seven days a week, and I encourage interested buyers to visit the centre as well as local residents who may be interested in the features of the development or have questions about what is planned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031131"></A>
Fitzgibbon Chase is also a very green development and was the first project in Australia to receive full marks under the UDIA’s EnviroDevelopment version 2.0, which recognises exemplary sustainable development projects. I also joined with the Premier recently to announce that 40 hectares at Fitzgibbon will be preserved for the community. Tracks and trails will be constructed through the bushland to north of Fitzgibbon Chase between Telegraph Road and Roghan Road. Greening Australia has begun work to rehabilitate and revegetate the bushland and north side trainees will participate in the tracks and trails project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031140"></A>
Premier and Minister for the Arts, Anna Bligh, also announced a grant for ‘Tuned Handrails’ through Arts Queensland from the art+place Queensland public art fund. As part of providing a sense of place within the Fitzgibbon Chase development, the ULDA is including public art for the community to enjoy. The ULDA is currently working with three artists on a project which will be incorporated in a new bridge. Called ‘Tuned Handrails’, this project involves the installation of handrails on the bridge which will be designed to play a tune--quite softly, I will let local residents know. The winning entry from the three artists is expected to be decided in the next month or so. A footbridge is also being constructed to connect current residents of Fitzgibbon with the shortest route within walking distance to Carseldine Railway Station and planning is also continuing on the community centre. The Bligh government is delivering affordable housing, green space, lifestyle and jobs for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038509"></A>
This bill has three objectives. The bill will give state school principals the power to exclude a student enrolled at the principal’s school for a period of not more than one year or permanently. The bill will allow care services that are approved to provide a kindergarten program to record unit record level data and to disclose this data to the Department of Education and Training. It will also make minor amendments to the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000 to achieve consistency with national arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038510"></A>
The government is committed to creating a safe and supportive learning environment that encourages all students to attend school. For state schools to achieve better learning outcomes for all students it is necessary for schools to have effective policies in place and adequate powers to maintain discipline and promote positive student behaviour in an environment that is conducive to learning and free from disturbances of inappropriate student behaviour.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038511"></A>
This is why, in December last year, the government made a public commitment to give state school principals the legislative power to exclude students enrolled at their schools. The green paper <Hansard-Italic>
A flying start for Queensland children</Hansard-Italic>
, released on 2 February 2010, reiterates the government’s commitment to provide state school principals with more power to exclude students to keep bad behaviour out of the classroom. These amendments are about achieving an appropriate balance between a principal’s authority to manage the behaviour of their students at their school and ensuring all students have access to a positive education environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038512"></A>
The bill provides state school principals with the power to exclude a student for a period of not more than one year or permanently. A principal would be able to exclude a student from their school if reasonably satisfied grounds exist to exclude the student and the principal does not reasonably believe it would be inappropriate for them to make a decision to exclude the student. The new power will not prevent a principal from also making a recommendation to the principal’s supervisor for the supervisor to exclude the student from the school or certain other state schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038513"></A>
Exclusion decisions are made as a last resort where other support and intervention strategies implemented by the school have proven to be ineffective. The type of behaviour that could lead to a notice proposing exclusion must be seriously inappropriate behaviour such as physical assault, possession of weapons or illicit drugs and significant property damage. When the principal sends a notice to the student proposing to exclude them, the principal is required to arrange the student’s access to an educational program that allows the student to continue their education until a final decision is made about the student’s exclusion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038514"></A>
The amendments allow the student or the student’s parent to make submissions to the principal against the suspension and proposed exclusion. In addition, if the principal decides to exclude the student, the student can appeal the exclusion decision to the director-general. Re-engagement of excluded students is a key priority for the government. Case management will ensure that excluded students are enrolled in another school, alternative education program or other appropriate option.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038515"></A>
The Department of Education and Training currently provides more than 100 alternative education programs, including 15 positive learning centres available to support students with behaviour problems. Students are also able to enrol in distance education as an option where physical attendance at a school is not appropriate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Under the National Information Agreement on Early Childhood Education and Care, the Queensland government is required to develop the capacity to collect and report data about individual children and individual staff in the kindergarten setting. This is generally referred to as unit record level or URL data. URL data in relation to individual children will include the child’s name, sex, date of birth, address of their primary residence, primary language, Indigenous status, hours of attendance in a kindergarten program and whether the child or the child’s parent or guardian hold a healthcare card. This data in relation to a staff member will include the person’s name, their early childhood and teaching qualifications, primary language and Indigenous status.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038518"></A>
To meet Queensland’s obligations under the agreement, the bill amends the Child Care Act 2002 to enable services that are approved to provide a kindergarten program to record and disclose this data to the department, either directly or through a central governing body. In addition, the bill enables the department to disclose relevant data to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The department will also have the ability to disclose this data to a central governing body for specified purposes. All of that information will be governed by appropriate privacy provisions.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1038519"></A>
The bill makes two minor amendments to the Vocational Education, Training and Employment Act 2000 to achieve consistency with national standards. Firstly, to ensure compliance with the national skills framework, the bill amends the definition of ‘statement of attainment’ to include a skill set as an additional category of achievement in vocational education and training that may be certified by a registered training organisation. Secondly, the bill amends the definition of ‘national register’ by omitting the reference to the National Training Information Service and substituting it with a generic reference to the register of vocational education and training. This is because the National Training Information Service database is being redeveloped and is likely to be replaced with a database bearing a different name. The amendment ensures the definition remains current despite any changes to the name of the database. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The bill before the House implements important reforms to further strengthen the performance of the Queensland government’s workers compensation scheme. Labor governments in Queensland have a long and proud history of protecting workers from injury in the workplace and for providing compensation for those who find themselves in this unfortunate situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038534"></A>
In 1916, the Labor government, led by TJ Ryan, introduced Queensland’s first compulsory workers compensation scheme for non-government employers which extended to almost all workers in the state rather than just the manual workers who had previously been covered. This Labor government continues to protect workers and their families by ensuring that the workers compensation scheme that has been such an important part of the protections provided to workers continues to deliver significant benefits for all injured workers in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038535"></A>
The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 follows the business review of WorkCover Queensland presented to me on 18 November 2009 by the WorkCover board. The independent business review of WorkCover Queensland by Deloitte identified possible solutions to ensure WorkCover’s financial position. The review identified a number of issues that were impacting on WorkCover’s financial position. These impacts have also affected other schemes in operation in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038571"></A>
WorkCover was not immune to the global financial crisis, and two consecutive years of significant negative investment returns had made its impact. The independent review found that WorkCover was experiencing an increasing number of claims and claims costs, particularly common law claims. It also found that premium income was not keeping pace with claims growth. These factors resulted in a loss of $381 million before tax in 2007-08 followed by a loss of $894 million in 2008-09, totalling an accumulated operating deficit of $1.3 billion before tax which has been absorbed by investment reserves. The management and performance of WorkCover Queensland had been strong for so long that, despite these losses, the scheme remained fully funded at 30 June 2009 with a positive funding ratio of 127 per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038576"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, the global financial crisis has had a very significant impact on virtually all governments, businesses and the community generally. While WorkCover did not escape this crisis, its continued stable performance contrasted with that of other Australian workers compensation schemes that did not fare as well through the global financial crisis. Victoria’s workers compensation scheme had a funding ratio of 97 per cent at 30 June 2009 and posted a $1.254 billion operating deficit for 2008-09, while in South Australia unfunded liabilities grew to $1.059 billion. The Bligh Labor government is proud of its track record in, and commitment to, balancing good benefits for injured workers with affordable premiums for employers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038577"></A>
While it was clear from the business review of WorkCover Queensland that action needed to be taken to ensure the solvency of the scheme, the government was not prepared to consider significant changes without careful consultation with scheme stakeholders. A discussion paper was released on 23 February 2010 which invited public comment by 24 March 2010. It outlined a number of possible proposals aimed at ensuring the continued financial health of the workers compensation scheme. A stakeholder reference group was established comprising representatives of employers, unions and the legal profession to consider the submissions and provide advice to me. The reference group, which I chaired, met on four occasions over a six-week period. Sixty written submissions were received in response to the discussion paper from employers, self-insurers, unions, workers, lawyers and health professionals. It was reassuring to note that none of the submissions received suggested a change to the fundamental nature of the Queensland scheme--that is, a short tail scheme with access to common law proceedings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038578"></A>
Three themes were consistently raised by stakeholders: first, the need for a much stronger focus on rehabilitation and return-to-work outcomes; second, concern that WorkCover accepts claims too easily and settles common law claims for sums that are too high, a claim strongly denied by WorkCover and, no doubt, anyone who has had claims refused in the past; and, third, concerns regarding the transparency of the scheme, including institutional arrangements involving the timely release of information to stakeholders. To address the veracity or otherwise of these concerns, the government intends to undertake an independent structural review of institutional and working arrangements in Queensland’s workers compensation scheme. The government is committed to ensuring that the Queensland scheme remains the best and fairest in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038580"></A>
The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 will see the workers compensation common law damages arrangements, including liability, quantum and some contributory negligence provisions, harmonised with the Civil Liability Act 2003. The liability and contributory negligence provisions in the Civil Liability Act 2003 have been incorporated into the bill, with modifications to take account of the workplace context. For example, voluntary assumption of risk will not apply because the courts have recognised that it is inappropriate in an employment context. The mandatory reduction in damages of at least 25 per cent for a person whose intoxication contributed to their injury, reflecting section 47 of the Civil Liability Act 2003, is included in the bill. However, a provision equivalent to section 48 of the Civil Liability Act 2003, which has mandatory reductions in damages for anyone injured by someone they knew or should have known was intoxicated, is not included in the bill because injured workers could unfairly lose damages, even if an employer did not manage alcohol or drug related issues at the workplace.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038584"></A>
Under the bill, general damages, being damages for pain and suffering, will be capped at approximately $300,000. Damages for economic loss, being loss of future earnings, will be capped at three times Queensland ordinary time earnings for the purposes of calculating annual earnings. Queensland ordinary time earnings are currently $1,132.10 per week, being $58,869 per annum. Three times Queensland ordinary time earnings is $176,607. This amount will be the maximum annual earnings a court will be able to take into account when calculating loss of future earnings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038587"></A>
Another area of difference between the Civil Liability Act 2003 and the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003, apart from the contributory negligence provisions, is the requirement for damages to be assessed in accordance with a set scale. To determine general damages, an injury scale value, or ISV, will be used to assess a worker’s dominant injury. The ISV scale is the same as the scale set up in the Civil Liability Regulation 2003. The effect of the ISV is that it compresses claims at the lower end of the scale and benefits more seriously injured workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038590"></A>
I now turn to the exclusion of damages for voluntary services provided to the injured worker such as care by a family member and damages for voluntarily services provided by the person which are provided for under the Civil Liability Act 2003 but not under the workers compensation legislation. It is proposed to consider these damages for inclusion as part of a further review of the scheme to be held in two years, by which time the effects of the global financial crisis should have diminished significantly and the impacts of implementation of the preferred option on common law claims lodgements will be known. Of course, injured workers will continue to receive fair benefits through the statutory scheme, which remains unchanged. However, as outlined previously, if an injured worker elects to pursue a common law claim, the worker will be subject to quantum and liability restrictions. In addition, a court will be able to award costs against a worker where a claim is not successful.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038593"></A>
The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 currently allows cost orders only where the court awards more or less than a party’s final written offer of damages. This has been interpreted by the courts to mean that, if the claim is dismissed, no costs are payable. This has led to the situation where a plaintiff who receives less than a defendant’s final offer suffers costs consequences, yet a plaintiff who receives no damages because the claim is dismissed is not required to pay the other party’s costs. The bill also provides that a plaintiff who loses a case outright can be ordered to pay WorkCover’s costs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038594"></A>
The decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Bourk v Power Serve Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2008] QCA 225 affirmed that, if a worker is injured at work and there is a causal connection between the injury and work, the employer has breached its duty under the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995. This has led to increasing numbers of common law claims based on the perception that strict liability attaches to an employer in common law proceedings if a work injury has occurred, regardless of fault. The bill amends the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 to remove any private civil right of action arising under the act--that is, a worker will not be able to rely on a breach of the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 to support their claim of common law negligence. This amendment will preclude retrospectively and prospectively only those claims where negligence under common law cannot be proved. The approach is justified on the basis that common law claims under the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 are generally lodged between one and three years after the injury. If the amendment only applied to injuries that occurred after the introduction of the bill into parliament, it will not address the growth in claims.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038596"></A>
I have outlined the impact of the bill on injured workers’ common law claims. I would now like to outline the impact on employers and others. The chairperson of the WorkCover Board has advised that, based on the policy proposals contained in this amendment bill, the board has set an average premium rate of $1.30 per $100 of wages for the 2010-11 premium year. Victoria and Western Australia have announced average premium rates for 2010-11. Victoria, the state with the next lowest employer premium costs, has recently announced an average premium rate of $1.34 per $100 of wages for 2010-11, which is 3.1 per cent more than the Queensland rate. Western Australia’s average premium rate for 2010-11 is $1.497, which is 15.2 per cent higher than the Queensland rate. The average Queensland rate for 2010-11 also compares favourably with the current average premium rates of $1.69 for New South Wales, $3 for South Australia and $1.97 for Tasmania. By maintaining a scheme that is more than competitive with the other states and territories, Queensland is providing a platform to continue its economic strength as the global financial crisis abates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038597"></A>
The bill also increases the employer excess which is paid when a worker is injured from 65 per cent of Queensland ordinary times earnings, or $740 for most employers, to 100 per cent of Queensland ordinary times earnings, currently $1,132, or one week of compensation, whichever is the lesser amount. The increase in the employer excess will provide an incentive to employers to improve injury rates. The bill will also require third-party contributors to participate meaningfully in settlement negotiations through the exchange of relevant documents, providing estimates of costs and submitting mandatory final offers to reduce the duration of claims and legal fees. Contributors are parties that an insurer considers may share liability for an injury, such as a manufacturer of products containing asbestos.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038598"></A>
Queensland continues to enjoy the most financially stable scheme in Australia. The proposed reforms should ensure the status quo is maintained. The government is committed to ensuring that the Queensland scheme remains the best and fairest in Australia. To ensure this objective, an overall effectiveness review of WorkCover’s current and future financial position will be undertaken in two years time and completed by 31 December 2012. By this time, the full impact of the amendments I have outlined today will be known. I want to take this opportunity to thank the representatives of employers, workers, self-insurers and lawyers for their open and cooperative approach in ensuring the ongoing strength of Australia’s best and fairest compensation scheme. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (2.49 pm): This bill before the House amends 25 acts and 12 regulations. Some of the changes are mundane but others are controversial and unacceptable to the opposition. Under the LNP, Queensland is not for sale. Thus it is no surprise that we will be strongly rejecting amendments in this bill that facilitate Labor’s dishonest sale of Queensland’s assets. The LNP will also be standing up for Queensland against moves to hit motorists once again with price hikes caused by Labor’s economic incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038649"></A>
Queenslanders are hurting under Labor’s economic mismanagement. They are tired of being price gouged to make up the difference for projects that have been poorly managed by this Labor administration. The sections of the bill that the LNP will be opposing include the extension of tolling powers--for the minister to declare additional roadways as tolls and potentially roads that are not currently tolled. We will be opposing sections that further facilitate the sale of Queensland’s assets, such as businesses and assets of QR, the ports and motorways, which is abhorrent to the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038650"></A>
Thanks to Labor’s mismanagement, Queensland is now the most expensive state in this nation in which to own and operate a car. The proposed new Queensland driver’s licence will end up costing the most in Australia--more than double what it costs motorists currently. That increase comes on top of record increases in registration, with Queensland having the most expensive registration and also the highest petrol prices, thanks to the petrol tax that was brought in by Labor. These increases are taxing motorists off the roads and, as a result, they are certainly not seeing a benefit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038651"></A>
But let me address this new Queensland driver’s licence. On at least three occasions legislation has come before this House to provide a legislative base for this licence. It is a project that is yet to come to fruition. But we know that the cost of this project, which initially started out at about $20 million, is now up to around about $100 million. Owing to mismanagement, this project has blown out in cost. Other things have changed since this project was first mooted. One thing we were told is that it was going to be really smart. All we have seen is a bit of smart acting from the government about the price increase. The new driver’s licence was supposed to be about cracking down on fraud and that it contained a chip that was supposed to store information. But these days, if you ask government members what will be stored on that chip they cannot answer you. We asked that question when this matter previously came before the House in other legislation and there was no answer from the government. We have asked that question in briefings and, once again, there has been no answer from the government. This government expects Queenslanders to pay more than double for a licence under a new licensing scheme but it keeps how it is going to use the information contained in it secret and clutched to its chest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038652"></A>
Originally, this new licence was supposed to have the address contained inside it and not displayed. The government belatedly woke up to the fact that a lot of other establishments rely on being able to see people’s address on their licence. Then there arose the perplexing question as to who was going to have card readers. Obviously, a lot of pubs and clubs were not going to have readers. We were told that even the police were not going to have readers. Once again, the introduction of the new driver’s licence has been a shemozzle. It has been a mess. There has been a cost blow-out and motorists are expected to pay for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038653"></A>
Where is the value for money? Today in this House we heard the transport minister stand up and say, ‘Trust us. It’s value for money.’ But the government still cannot tell us exactly how it is going to use it. That is a secret that the government is not sharing with Queenslanders who are expected to pay for this new driver’s licence and that is not good enough. Nobody believes what the government says about privacy when it has broken its promise about so many things--the cost of this project, the new fuel tax, the asset sales. So who would trust the government with the privacy issues associated with this card? What information will be stored on the card? Who is going to have scanners? Who is going to have access to those? Those questions remain unanswered by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038654"></A>
But it is not only a new Queensland driver’s licence that is up for public debate; it is also the proof of age card, because those Queenslanders who do not have a driver’s licence will be expected increasingly to have a proof of age card which, as far as we are aware from previous public comments, is going to cost the same amount as a driver’s licence. Ultimately, this card will become the de facto Australia Card--an identity card that people will be expected to carry with the ability to store information that the government will not tell you how to access and check and who will have access to it. This card is becoming an Australia Card, where people are going to find that information on this card will potentially be held by this government. If that were not the case, why on earth would the government pursue a project of issuing a card with a chip that holds information? It is time the government came clean not just on the full cost of this project; it is time it came clean on the major privacy issues that it has failed miserably to answer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038656"></A>
Already, Queensland has many unlicensed drivers. When governments start to price gouge motorists and others for the cost of a driver’s licence, will we see more and more people choose not to have, or fail to be able to afford, the take-up or renewal of their driver’s licence? This issue raises the very real spectre of more and more unlicensed drivers on our roads. I believe that is a major concern, because it has ramifications for people who may be involved in accidents with those who were driving unlicensed. If you hike up the price of a driver’s licence this much, you are taxing off the road those who are obeying the law or allowing others to drive unlicensed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038657"></A>
I want to also address another taxing issue that exists under this government. I am not talking about Kevin Rudd’s new super tax and the jobs that will be lost from Queensland and the way in which this government has rolled over and played dead in regard to Queensland’s royalties going to southern states and even then not being quarantined for infrastructure. I want to talk about the powers in this legislation that give the Department of Transport and Main Roads the ability to extend where they apply tolls. Not that long ago I asked the main roads minister about the possibility of this government putting distance based tolls on Queensland’s roads. I refer to that question, because the minister did not answer it. It was not a yes or a no or a maybe; he refused to answer the question. We know that this government has investigated at a high level where else they can apply tolls on Queensland’s roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038659"></A>
For those who are not familiar with the term distance based tolling, I will explain that it tolls people on a section of road between point A and point B. It uses technology to toll people over that distance as opposed to the set-up of some existing motorways, such as the Gateway and Logan motorways, where people are able to get on and off and they pay their tolls at tolling booths that are located at a fixed point. So distance based tolls for Queensland, particularly with the motorways, could mean that we will see more motorways tolled than there are currently. People will find that entries and exits of motorways will have a tolling gantry in future. It means a different way of applying the tolls. But this government has refused to release all of the reports that have been made on extending this way of tolling Queensland’s roads. I call on this government to release the reports. Enough of their secrets. Queenslanders have a right to know.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038660"></A>
That is one reason we will be voting against this head of power to give the government a means of applying tolls across other roads beyond those that have been publicly identified as being in the pipeline. That is a head of power that we are not prepared to extend to the government without understanding what it is up to. We do not trust this government and neither should Queenslanders. Why on earth would you give more tolling powers beyond the existing projects that have been mooted? Why on earth would you give a blank cheque to a government that has abused its access to Queenslanders’ dollars and which cannot keep its sticky fingers out of Queenslanders’ pockets? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042405"></A>
Motorists in Queensland have a reason to be furious at the way they have been price-gouged by this government. They are paying the highest costs in this nation due to this government’s mismanagement. They are sick and tired of it and calling for change. We will stand up for good economic management. We will stand up against the sticky fingers of this Labor government in the pockets of motorists because we sure as heck are not seeing that money go into infrastructure. It is going into the bottomless pit of a mob who could not run a chook raffle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042408"></A>
I want to turn now to some of the other aspects of this legislation. I will address the issues of speed cameras which has been in the news lately. We actually saw this legislation before the parliament--shock, horror--on 24 March 2010. For the benefit of this House I will quote from my contribution in that debate. I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1042410"></A>
We certainly want to see clarity and ensure that there is legislative backing to enforce these provisions, but the fact that the cameras are in operation and that legislative clarity has not been there I think will surprise a lot of people. I asked whether there were any current legal cases pertaining to this, and I was advised that there were not. We certainly understand that the law must be clear. But one area in which the government is not speedy is ensuring timely legislation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042411"></A>
It is worth repeating those words because has that not been shown to be true? Those cameras were already up and running and we were told that they were not going to apply the fines from those cameras, that they would wait until the legislation was in place. Now we find that they did not even have the administrative processes to apply the law properly in place and that there have been literally thousands found to have been speeding but the legislation and how it was applied was a bit shonky. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042412"></A>
This is not the first time under this government that we have seen legislation passed through this House to be shonky in how it has been applied. I cannot let it go unnoted that limousines that were required by legislation only three years ago to have electronic booking systems will no longer have that requirement under this legislation because the government got it wrong. It put through provisions in relation to which it had not undertaken consultation, had not listened to industry and obviously did not listen to the state opposition when we warned that it had it wrong and that the proposal as it was would not work. Here is the evidence of that, with provisions in this legislation to revoke those sections in regard to limousines requiring electronic booking systems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042413"></A>
I want to refer to the comments made on 9 October 2007 by my colleague Tim Nicholls, the member for Clayfield, who was the shadow transport minister at the time. He drew this matter to the government’s attention. Its answer at the time was to abuse the opposition. Its answer at the time was to abuse those who raised a dissenting voice to the heavy hand of government. It failed to listen. Now it has been proven that we were right because we were listening to those who were telling us it was unworkable. The revocation of that section comes forward in this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042414"></A>
This government has become very arrogant in the way it designs legislation. We saw in March--only a few months ago--that there were provisions in legislation before the House to deal with a repair register in the motor vehicle industry. Those provisions could not be proceeded with because, once again, the government had not carried out the appropriate consultation before bringing that legislation to the House. It is up to government to use its powers appropriately and in a timely way to ensure that the business of Queenslanders is undertaken safely and in an orderly way. </Hansard-Body>

This brings me to the issue of maritime safety and some of the extraordinary situations we have witnessed in the last couple of years under this government. The spill which occurred within Moreton Bay from the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 was an extraordinary event but one which should have been foreseen by Maritime Safety Queensland. The two independent reports that were written as a result of that incident, which analysed the response of the various government agencies and how they handled the incident, were damning in regard to Maritime Safety Queensland. I have no doubt that there are individuals who tried their best, but one cannot ignore the facts when one reads these reports. They highlight just how far short this government has fallen in applying the resources of the people and their taxes to the protection of the environment and to maintaining that order that I was talking about. </Hansard-Body>

Let me refresh the memories of members in this House. Page 27 of ‘<Hansard-Italic>

Maritime Safety Queensland has knowledge and expertise in oil spill response, but has limited capacity to deal with large scale oil spill incidents without additional support. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042419"></A>
Page 27 goes on to say that they could not manage this alone. The report states ‘there is currently no model’. They had no model in place to deal with this. They had no plan in place to deal with a major oil spill. It makes one ask what on earth this government is doing. This is basic--‘Environmental Protection 101’. There should have been a plan to deal with a major oil spill in Queensland waters and certainly in Moreton Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042420"></A>
What I think is disturbing is that this government is still tinkering around the edges. We welcome the additional penalties that are in this legislation that will apply to those who pollute our waters. However, I will continue to call for a full overhaul of Maritime Safety Queensland because what we have not seen from this government is an acknowledgement of the major leadership issues, the systemic issues in government and what occurred during that oil spill.

There was a lack of leadership across agencies and clarity about who was doing what. That was clear in the reports that we are tabling. I am happy to refer to the comments I have previously quoted in this parliament from these reports. We see only denial from this government. It is still patting itself on the back over the way this matter was handled. As I have said, individual people may have done their best, but the lack of leadership and the systemic failures were quite clear. All we see is denial from a government that wants to tick policy boxes rather than take action on fixing the issues. It certainly has not done that. It is damning considering the fact that we have now seen another issue arise with the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
. This incident occurred in Commonwealth waters, but still the issues pertaining to state waters have not been resolved. More needs to be done than just looking at the fines that apply. More needs to be done in regard to the whole system of prevention and a more adequate means of coordinating a response if an incident does occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042424"></A>
For this transport minister to say that it is completely acceptable to have a coal ship come in and unload in sensitive waters off Fraser Island as if it is an ordinary event I think needs to be condemned. Where are the plans in place to deal with these issues when we have an incident such as that involving the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
? To suggest that it is acceptable to have it come into the waters around Hervey Bay and off Fraser Island, a sensitive marine area, I think is just another example of this government laying down and copping it and potentially exposing the environment due to its lack of plans and actions in this regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045739"></A>
I asked in the briefing about some of the other powers in regard to maritime laws that are proposed. There are powers that are to be extended in regard to directions that can be taken by the department in state waters. I asked about whether the state would in fact be liable if there were consequent maritime pollution or damage that occurred as a result of a state direction. The answer was qualified but indicated that, yes, it was possible for the state to be liable if something occurred as a result of a state direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045763"></A>
I would say that we want to see a far better system of response in future from any government agency and certainly better coordination of government agencies if an incident were to occur in future. No-one wants to see any incidents. Considering the amount of shipping traffic up and down our coastline and the potential for future expansion of the mining industry and other general freight being carried along our coastline, it is time that we demanded greater accountability and greater governance and ensured there was a far better system of response in future. It is just not good enough for this government to use its spin and ignore the warnings contained in government reports. I think that is why we are so wary about some of the statements to date. It is quite clear that the government has learned nothing, that it has no intention of changing its spots. Its members are still congratulating themselves on a situation which resulted from, quite frankly, good luck rather than good management in regard to the way in which the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 in particular was dealt with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045767"></A>
I want to address an issue that I alluded to at the start of my speech, that is, how this government has misled the people of Queensland about asset sales. There are provisions here which will be facilitating the sale of the assets and the structure of QR and the port of Brisbane and other provisions with regard to tollways. The LNP opposes these sales and will be opposing these sections of the bill. We have made it quite clear that this government could not run a chook raffle. The sale of QR alone will only pay about 18 months of the interest bill on the debt that has been racked up under Premier Bligh and the Labor government. What we have here is an example of this government selling off the house to pay the grocery bill. It does not have a debt reduction strategy. It also does not have a plan to ensure that capital that it comes by is quarantined for infrastructure. Quite simply, what we still see is a government that has no clue in regard to the good economic management of this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045769"></A>
That is made quite clear when we see it rolling over and playing dead for the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, when he comes along and says that he has a great big new tax and he is going to take it out of Queensland based industries and is going to send it to South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria and, by the way, it is not quarantined for infrastructure. I do not feel quite so grateful to the Prime Minister for ripping off Queensland that way. At the end of the day, we know it is not coming back and going into infrastructure for Queensland. It is crumbs at our table and it is being taken out of the future potential income stream of industry in this state. It is impacting on jobs already.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045770"></A>
I think it is extremely pertinent to address how this Labor government manages its infrastructure and then the sale of that infrastructure. At the briefing about Queensland Rail I asked the question once again: how are the assets being broken up for sale? I had asked a question on notice of the minister as to what rail lines were up for sale and which assets, and the minister simply referred me to a website. One would think that maybe the detail was on that website, but no, it was not. When I asked again at the briefing about the proposed break-up of those assets, particularly with regard to which rail lines, once again that information was not forthcoming. There are rail lines in Queensland that are not just for coal; they have other users. What the access arrangements will be in relation to those rail lines which carry coal and intersect with other infrastructure has not been revealed. Once again, in the secret state of Labor and its asset sales, we do not see what is really proposed for the restructure and the sale of assets. That is a secret that is held close to the chest of this government and whatever it proposes to do in future, and we are not prepared to agree with it and write a blank cheque. There has been a lot of warning from industry about QR becoming a private monopoly and what that will mean for the marketplace as well, and those issues remain unresolved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045773"></A>
I asked the question again in the briefing as to what the access arrangements will be with privately controlled infrastructure and they were unable to provide clarity about that point; quite frankly, I do not believe the briefing did either. This government is willing to grab the cash but it is not willing to tell anybody about how it intends to protect the public interest in access to these assets for future industry and the public good of Queensland. Particularly in relation to how it owns and operates infrastructure, government has to have a view beyond today--has to have a view beyond just a quick grab for money--and also for future generations of this state. We see no plan from this government as to how it is going to address those basic public interest tests not just for today but for the future, and that is of major concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045775"></A>
Last week with my colleagues I travelled around North Queensland and I met with people from across industry. The way that Queensland Rail is being flogged off and the arrangements post sale continues to resonate as a major concern. We have seen nothing done by this current government to address ongoing concerns. So we will be opposing those provisions of the bill which relate to the facilitation of this asset sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045776"></A>
I want to address another issue that is contained in this bill and that is the Gold Coast Rapid Transit system. The LNP supports delivery of a rapid transit system for the Gold Coast. As it is one of the largest cities in Australia in its own right, it is critical to have good and real integrated public transport systems, and I stress the words ‘integrated public transport systems’. While this proposal certainly does not address all of the integration issues, we believe it is a piece of infrastructure which will be supported strongly by many in the community for the long term. Yes, there are issues that still have to be resolved in relation to how it interfaces with the community, and we always reserve the right to demand that there is value for money and probity in the way that these projects are brought together. So the other day it was rather interesting to see a backflip from the federal government, which was originally going to give a grant and then going to give an equity injection but has now gone back to giving a grant towards the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project and it gets announced as something new.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045778"></A>
It is quite clear that there have been a lot of fights behind the scenes with Treasury and the federal government--maybe the transport minister was not involved--to try to resolve the funding issues around this project. The fight over the equity injection versus the grant has been high up there because the federal government has got a little bit jack of the way the state government has mismanaged some of its infrastructure projects. We certainly want to see this project proceed with value for money and attention to some of the issues that are obviously impacting upon people who are affected by that corridor. I will never resile from the fact that they deserve to be represented as well. It is not good enough for government and Big Brother to come along and say they have the might and they will ignore the impact upon local people. It is important that, as part of the implementation of this infrastructure, those local impacts are taken into consideration and the people who are caught in the process are not forgotten. At the end of the day, governments have a lot of resources; individuals do not, and they can feel very disempowered if government does not give some consideration to the impact upon their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045780"></A>
As I have mentioned, 25 acts and 12 regulations are being amended in this bill. However, one that is a particular concern that was raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in quite a lengthy contribution to the House was the acquisition of land provisions. I asked questions about this once again in the briefing. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report notes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1045782"></A>
Clauses 113, 178, 198 and 202 which may be inconsistent with the requirement that legislation provide for the compulsory acquisition of property only with fair compensation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049186"></A>
It is an understanding that if the state, in the public interest, needs to acquire people’s property, there should be fair compensation, and that is a principle we should always fight for. As I alluded to before, a state government or any government has a lot more power than the individual when they are dealing with acquisition and some of those individuals can find themselves facing quite a stiff fight unless government attempts to be fair and understands the relative power of acquisition and does not abuse its power over the little people. I think that there would be few members in this parliament who would not have had situations where constituents have faced the heart-wrenching situation of losing their home with government exercising its power of acquisition over their property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049192"></A>
I personally knew people who had heart attacks and died when faced with a future acquisition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045822"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
A government member:</Hansard-Bold>
 Oh!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045823"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not think that is a laughing matter. It should provide a wake-up call to show how the powers of government are used with regards to people’s private property. The government must apply not only fair compensation, but also justice and compassion in the process. The fact that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee warns that this legislation may be inconsistent with the requirement for fair compensation rings loud alarm bells. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045824"></A>
In the briefing I asked how some of the changes to land acquisition would apply. I was told that if a property was going to increase in value because of proposed transport infrastructure to be built near the property, the owner should not get a windfall from the purchase or acquisition of their property by the government. While that sounds all well and good in theory, I know of examples where people have gone into negotiations with the government because of a proposal to build a road through their property, and this government’s negotiators have said, ‘You don’t deserve as much for the land that has been acquired, because the balance of the property has spiked in value only because of the road that will go through it. Therefore, we will not give you as much for the land that we are taking, even though we believe you have had a windfall benefit on the balance of the land.’ In that example, the road was a limited access road which the property owner did not have access to. I give that as an example because I get very wary when governments seek to extend their powers with regard to the acquisition of land provisions and I wonder whether in fact they are telling the whole story. Certainly we see cases where some negotiators will say whatever it takes and quote whatever piece of legislation is useful for government, regardless of whether it is consistent. Once again, the little person is fighting for fair compensation against a very well resourced government and they can find themselves left out on a limb. I have major concerns about the provisions before the House relating to the acquisition of land because, as it stands, the practice is not always fair, compensation is not always fair and certainly the power balance between people and the government is not fair. Do governments need the power of acquiring land for a public good? Yes they do, but certainly I will fight for the rights of people to have fair compensation and to be protected from an abuse of power in that relationship, because that is not in the interests of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045825"></A>
A lot of other provisions are referred to with concern by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I will come to some of those when we consider the bill in detail. I wish to address some of the heavy vehicle provisions in the legislation. Certainly we support national model legislation and reforms where the interests of Queensland are upheld and we will always fight for those changes to be, first and foremost, of benefit to our state. It is a big nation and there are a lot of differences across state borders, but there is a lot of traffic within our state borders because of the vast distances of the state. That is why any changes must take into consideration the very unique needs of this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045826"></A>
There are measures in the legislation that I support, but there are some questions that I must raise, particularly in regard to those changes as they apply to an additional power for the department to charge for damage upon roads. There is an existing power for the department to apply for damages when trucks have caused damage to roads. I asked a question about this in the briefing because I wanted to know what was the difference between the existing power and what is proposed under the national reforms in this legislation. It was explained that there was an additional power and that we do have an existing power. However, even in the subsequent briefing note, which I did not receive until after midday today, the department does not really provide clarification as to the real difference between the existing power and the new power. I ask the minister to explain what the differences are, because so far her department has not provided that clarity. Its information has been fairly rudimentary. We have a right to know about changes that are made when the power already exists in another form. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045827"></A>
I have asked whether the legislation will address the issue of rail bridges being hit by trucks. That is a pretty relevant issue because if a vehicle is too high and hits a rail bridge, it can damage the bridge and knock out the rail service for some time. That has been a big issue, particularly around South-East Queensland where we rely on a certain frequency of service. If a bridge is out, it throws the whole network into confusion. As I understand it, this legislation does not sufficiently address that issue. I call on the minister to explain not only the legislative provisions that need to be put in place, but also when they are going to do that and how the provisions will be toughened up. I would also ask him to refer to the need for appropriate gantries to protect rail infrastructure. We have heard talk about it, but we are yet to see action. If oversized trucks try to go under those bridges, the damage they cause can have a major impact not only on the infrastructure but also on the services. People are getting sick and tired of seeing damage done to infrastructure and their lives thrown into chaos due to the inattention of those who are driving in places where they should not be. As I understand it from the briefing notes, the driver may be up for a $4,000 fine for inattention and the department may be able to pursue civil damages. However, I think that there is a hole in the legislation. I call on the minister to tell us what the government will do to fix this and to toughen up the provisions in regard to people who damage rail assets, especially when the effects of that damage are amplified through their impact upon rail services. Obviously boom gates are another issue that has had a considerable impact. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045828"></A>
Other changes in the legislation relate to transport infrastructure, such as vehicle access to driveways. It was explained that currently approval can be given attached to either the land or the person. This provision appears to be fairly uncontroversial as it is about clarifying the situation. There had been some administrative difficulty where, if the land was sold and the approval was attached to the person, the approval expired. This amendment makes the approval consistent and attached to the land. Certainly that seems to make a lot of sense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045829"></A>
Other changes in the legislation relate to the definition of rail infrastructure, clarifying that it will include parking for a train station and that this will exempt that land from the development approval process. There were some later briefing notes on this issue. I ask the minister to further explain the types of development that can occur and outline the specific limitations on what can occur under this definition. I think there is always a lot of wariness about land that is under state control avoiding an appropriate approval process with regard to local amenity, local roads and local council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045830"></A>
Other changes to transport infrastructure include the environmental impacts on development, such as noise. The department will be able to order that these be mitigated by developers. Following recent legislation that clarified explicitly that rail, port and public passenger transport infrastructure had this power, I understand from the briefing that it put in doubt the implicit power, according to the department, for road infrastructure, thus the clarification in this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049326"></A>
I have already referred to concerns about those particular land acquisition provisions and the implications for landholders. I call on the minister to explain and to clarify the issues of development and what can potentially occur within these corridors with the redefinition of rail land. To reiterate our position, we are opposed to Labor’s assets sale. Queensland is not for sale under the LNP. That is why we will oppose those sections of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049330"></A>
We also believe that it is time to give Queensland motorists a fair go. We will not be extending cart blanche power to the minister in the declaration of tollways when some of those future tollways can include existing roads. That would be completely unacceptable. We will also be standing up against other toll hikes and charges that will see motorists’ pockets further gouged. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049332"></A>
Turning to the new Queensland driver’s licence, this is the third time we have seen this before the House. On principle, we will be opposing this provision because we are sick and tired of seeing motorists ripped off and not getting straight answers from a government about how it intends to use the information. I have launched an e-petition today with regard to the price hike of the proposed new Queensland driver’s licence. I urge all Queenslanders to have their say and sign that petition to send a message to this government that they care about getting value for money and to stop this government from putting its sticky hands in their pockets all the time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049333"></A>
We will support the other provisions of this legislation but, as outlined, we will be opposing some of these key points and we will address those further at the consideration in detail stage. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (3.30 pm): I rise today to contribute to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010, which is an omnibus bill incorporating changes to 25 acts and 12 regulations. A similar bill was also passed in parliament in April 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049336"></A>
The bill seeks to facilitate the restructure and divestment of the businesses of QR Ltd and the Port of Brisbane Corporation Ltd; to implement transitional arrangements to ensure a smooth transition during the restructure and divestment of the businesses of QR Ltd and PoBC; and to make consequential amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 and other legislation which arise from the proposed restructure and divestment of the businesses of QR Ltd and PoBC and ensure that the appropriate entity is subject to the applicable legislative framework. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049337"></A>
This bill is obviously being fast-tracked in order to facilitate the Bligh government’s dishonesty to the people of Queensland to sell off our assets without the consent of the public. The LNP will be opposing this section of the legislation, as we opposed the sale of assets when it was announced in the budget last year. Queenslanders have a right to feel angry and let down. How can the government expect them to count on it and trust that it has their best interests at the core of its decisions when it is prepared to kick them when they are down? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049338"></A>
The budget clearly showed why Queensland went to an early election. The government’s desperate need for an unnecessary fire sale of profitable public assets to try to fill a budget black hole was not something it wanted the voters to know. The only winners from this fire sale will be bargain hunters. In effect, the government is short-changing Queensland residents by this sale in the present financial climate. Its deceit has now cost this great state a burden of debt, but unfortunately it is not a burden that the government alone has to carry. It has extended this burden to every single Queensland mother, father and child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049339"></A>
The amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 will broaden the categories of land that can be declared by the minister to be state toll road corridor land. The amendments will also allow the associated registered and unregistered interests in the land to be dealt with by the minister at the same time. For consistency, similar amendments are being made to the local government tollway corridor provisions in the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994. The LNP will be opposing this section of the bill that relates to tollways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049340"></A>
My concern, as would be the concern of all Gold Coasters, is that if and when the M1 is upgraded--and we are still waiting for this to commence, even though the contract was awarded in February; it was due to commence in April and it is now already May--there is potential for the upgrade to be offset by a toll or a congestion tax, given this government’s track record on announcements. This legislation extends the categories of land the minister is able to declare a toll road. The LNP has grave concerns that this legislation may be the precursor for distance based tolling as opposed to tolling at fixed locations, and these concerns have not been properly addressed. The LNP opposed the sale of these assets and therefore will be opposing this section of the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049341"></A>
Just last week I joined disappointed Gold Coasters who woke up to the news that the 2010-11 Rudd Labor government budget had again neglected much needed infrastructure in our region. We are the country’s sixth largest city with a population growth unequalled anywhere, and tonight residents have been delivered another slap in the face, with no new funding for the much needed eight-laning of the M1 from Nerang to Tugun. This was the second Rudd budget which has delivered no new infrastructure for our main artery, the M1. All we see is the federal Labor government reannouncing funding provided by the Howard government which the Bligh Labor government has had sitting in the bank since 2007. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049342"></A>
To add insult to injury, we see press releases from Anthony Albanese, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, trumpeting the headline ‘Nation Building: Biggest Ever Roads Program Turns Three’ and listing projects that are already under construction. Given that the Bligh Labor government depends on the Rudd federal government to continue its infrastructure spend, residents would rightly be concerned that the six-laning of the M1 from Nerang to Worongary may be delayed more than it already is and that the promised eight-laning from Nerang to Tugun is nothing but fool’s gold. This upgrade has been reannounced time and time again with the Bligh government bleating that it cannot be completed without federal input. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049343"></A>
Even the federal minister, Anthony Albanese, had to admit to Channel 9 Gold Coast news that there were no new funds for this project and that the funds had already been announced three years ago! What is to stop the Bligh government from slugging taxpayers and residents stuck in the Mudgeeraba car park with a toll to help pay for this infrastructure? This government has run out of excuses now that its federal big brother has thumbed its nose at it. So where will the money come from to complete the entire section of the M1 from Nerang to Tugun? A tollway perhaps? Mudgeeraba residents are sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens by this arrogant, out-of-touch, on-the-nose Labor government. We want to see action, not spin and more rhetoric. Rest assured that I will continue to work with my federal colleagues and candidates to keep pressure on the Labor state and federal governments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049344"></A>
Finally, I would like to concur with our shadow minister regarding the new smart licences, which cannot even accommodate a change of address unless there is a sticker on the back--not too smart. I commend the bill to the House with reservations outlined. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (3.35 pm): I rise to speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). In her second reading speech the minister stated that this bill will deliver three significant reforms: it will better facilitate the development of infrastructure to deal with the challenges of a growing population and in particular provide legislative framework for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project; it will strengthen protection of the marine environment by providing tougher powers to Maritime Safety Queensland; and it will amend legislation to create a robust port planning regime for the future, maintain Queensland Rail as a passenger focused government owned corporation and establish QRNational as a proud, Queensland based company. It will also amend the Transport Infrastructure Act for a smooth transition during the restructure and divestment of the business of Queensland Rail Ltd. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049351"></A>
I believe that there is no pride in Queensland Rail anymore. I cannot see how we can make a statement that the passenger service is still in the proud ownership of Queensland taxpayers when we are about to sell off the profitable sector of Queensland Rail. Citytrain is running at a billion dollar loss. The passenger service all up is running at a billion dollar loss. The coal component is running at a billion dollar profit, yet we are going to sell that sector. So the question is: what happens after the coal component--the profitable sector of Queensland Rail--is sold and we are running at a billion dollar loss on the passenger service? Who is going to pay for that? Like I said, there is no pride in selling off Queensland Rail and there is no pride within Queensland Rail anymore. </Hansard-Body>

This sell-off is one of the greatest acts of betrayal by the Labor Party in Queensland’s history. We never thought we would see the day when a 144-year icon, built by the taxpayers of Queensland through their sweat and toil, would be sold by the current Bligh government, supported by every Labor MP in this House. Communities thrived on the back of the railways and could depend on a reliable freight service. It boasted up to 26,000 employees, and many of those workers were Aboriginals, South Sea Islanders and Torres Strait Islanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049360"></A>
It is a shame to see that from Townsville to Mount Isa there is no longer any rail freight service. With the size of the resources sector out there at Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Julia Creek and all of those towns in that region, there is a wonderful railway track and a road right beside it and not one train runs to support those communities with a rail freight service. Everything goes by truck. This is the result of years of a Labor government and its management of Queensland Rail, which once had 26,000 employees--now reduced to 12,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049363"></A>
There is a lot of insecurity in relation to employment. A lot of employees who have been employed in the last 20 or 30 years feel that their jobs are insecure. Two or three employees have been sacked from their positions on the grounds that they were not literate enough to fill out their safety form. The unions powerfully protested against that, and one of them received a reprieve and one of them left. Then another employee, knowing that his job was not secure, was appointed to a permanent, full-time job and so gave in his notice to Queensland Rail, but Queensland Rail penalised him $1,233 because he gave insufficient notice to leave on the grounds that he needed to take this other job.</Hansard-Body>

It is approved to accept your resignation with QR as from completion of duty on 20th April, 2010. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

However, employees are required to give 2 weeks notice of resignation. Failure to do so will result in a deduction from final pay of an amount equivalent to the period of notice not received. Advice of your resignation was received on 19th April, 2010. This means that you will be deducted monies for the period 21.04.2010 to 2.05.2010 which is the 2 week notice period.

This person is a bridge labourer. Twelve hundred dollars is a lot of money. They have deducted this amount from the date he decided to leave. He decided to leave because his job was not secure. I encourage the Minister for Transport to investigate this matter and to use her executive powers to enable this man to get his money. Twelve hundred dollars is a lot of money, especially for a bridge worker. The unions are very upset about it and have made an issue about it on TV. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr KNUTH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister has also stated that we will increase the penalties for marine pollution. This is the result of two damning reports on the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 disaster and the grounding of the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
. Research shows that the reef provides employment for some 63,000 people engaged in the tourism, fishing and recreation industries and yields annual revenues in the order of $5.8 billion, including $5.1 billion from tourism, $610 million from recreational activities and $119 million from commercial fishing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049417"></A>
At the last election who did the Premier target when it came to protecting the reef? She attacked the farmers in order to get the support of the radical green extremists who contribute very little to the economy. All this was done to save the government’s political hide. It was at the expense of the agricultural communities in the Burdekin, Mackay, Whitsunday and Wet Tropics catchments and put at risk the agricultural economy, which is under threat at present, worth $3.8 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049419"></A>
At the time nothing was done to protect the marine environment. Nothing was done about the nutrient run-off from the rainforests. Likewise, very little was done in relation to nutrient run-off from the cities. When it comes to the pressure that was placed on the area by <Hansard-Italic>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (3.43 pm): I rise to speak on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. Whilst there is much in this bill that is necessary, there is equally much that is unnecessary, reactive and downright questionable. As the member for Maroochydore and other speakers have already outlined, I and LNP will be opposing those provisions that facilitate the privatisation of Queensland Motorways and the Port of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049422"></A>
There is nothing complicated or difficult in this. The LNP had no plans to privatise Queensland’s assets. The LNP would not privatise these assets. The LNP would not flog them off in some labour induced fire sale. The LNP would declare to Queenslanders before an election any intention to privatise assets. If these assets are not sold by the next election the LNP will not persist with the sale. Let me repeat that: if these assets are not sold by the next election the LNP will stop, cease, halt, cancel the sales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049423"></A>
To those constituents of Glass House who work for Forestry Plantations Queensland, my apologies. That commitment will not help you. While the Treasurer crows about the $600 million sale price, you and I both know that it is only half of what the asset is actually worth. As your local MP I will continue to be there to represent your concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049425"></A>
The LNP also has concerns surrounding the amendments to the Transport (New Queensland Driver Licensing) Amendment Act 2008 and the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994. The more I hear about the new Queensland driver’s licence the more concerned I become. Now we are being told the information that was to be held on the chip will not be held on the chip. An individual’s address will still appear on the front of the licence, necessitating changes in the form they are made currently. What is smart about that? By the way, the people who will need to read the information on the chip will not be able to because they will not have the readers to do it. What is more, we are now told the licences will cost the earth. What currently costs $73.30 will next year cost $96.05. In five years it will cost $152.50. For what? It is not new, it is not smart and it is not value for money. It is more of the same at exorbitant prices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049428"></A>
To this, I add and express my concern at what may come with the proposed amendments to the state toll road corridor provisions of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994. The amendments, according to the explanatory notes, extend the categories of land that are eligible to be declared by the minister to be state toll road corridor land, streamline administrative processes for the creation of the relevant leases of land declared by the minister to be state toll road corridor land and appropriately deal with interests that may be affected by any such declaration made by the minister. I know this is freeing the government up for the impending sale of Queensland Motorways. But I also suspect it will allow for the expansion of toll roads across South-East Queensland and it will allow for the introduction of new tolling features such as distance based tolling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049431"></A>
The people of Queensland have had a gutful when it comes to the costs associated with running a vehicle. They now pay the highest amounts for fuel in the nation. They pay exorbitant amounts for registration. They will be hit again with the introduction of the new driver’s licence. Now they are going to be slugged to drive on South-East Queensland roads--roads they have a right to use; roads that should have been built years ago as the rivers of gold flowed throughout this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049434"></A>
Let me turn to the amendments regarding marine safety and pollution. I will not go into the detail as the shadow minister has done a sterling job in that regard. But I must highlight the reactiveness of this Bligh government. One would have thought the penalties and safety requirements contained in these amendments would have already been in place. After all, Queensland has one of the longest and busiest coastlines in Australia. What is more, it is home to the World Heritage listed, environmentally sensitive Great Barrier Reef and Fraser Island. Surely that would have led a government to ensure that it had the highest individual and corporate penalties, not to mention the powers to monitor and direct vessels. But no, it took the disaster of the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
, the grounding of the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 and the release of two damning reports for this government to wake up and take action. It is not good enough and the people of Queensland know it. They know it because their hard earned taxpayers’ dollars have paid for this government’s negligence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049435"></A>
Before I conclude, I would like to turn to the amendments being proposed to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, particularly those pertaining to the simplification of vehicular property access on state controlled roads. I would like to dwell on these amendments to sections 33, 50, 52, 67 and 70 for a moment. As the Minister for Main Roads will attest, I have been investigating the current requirements on landholders, specifically on a constituent, Mr Bill Phillips of Maleny-Kenilworth Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049439"></A>
Mr Phillips has a stunning property and is looking to offer quality overnight accommodation. Unfortunately, his entrepreneurial efforts are being stymied by Main Roads’ requirements regarding his vehicular access, his driveway. There are clearly discrepancies in these requirements. To develop a limited number--say, four or five--quality cabins Mr Phillips is being asked to make extensive road upgrades to the Maleny-Kenilworth Road. However, were he to offer a bed and breakfast facility such upgrades would not be required. This discrepancy is ludicrous. The cabins would accommodate the same number of guests as a B&amp;B. The cabins would lend themselves to more secluded on-site stays. B&amp;Bs, on the other hand, tend to be used primarily for eating and sleeping, which suggests that usage of the vehicular access would actually be higher with B&amp;Bs, not the cabins. I will be seeking clarification from the minister on this particular amendment in due course. In closing, I look forward to a vigorous debate during the consideration in detail stage. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (3.49 pm): I rise in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. In particular, I want to talk about amendments to the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995 that ensures that Queensland has the equal highest penalties in Australia for the discharge of oil, noxious liquid and the jettisoning of harmful substances such as containerised cargo. These amendments form one part of a number of planned pollution protection amendments and are consistent with the international principle of the polluter pays, the community’s expectation for zero tolerance of marine pollution and the high penalties for marine pollution offences imposed by all other Australian jurisdictions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053264"></A>
Currently the maximum penalty for the discharging of oil, noxious liquid, jettisoning of harmful substances or disposing of garbage is $350,000 for an individual and $1.7 million for a body corporate. This amendment will increase the penalty to a maximum of $500,000 for an individual and for a body corporate to $10 million. It is fundamental to the operation of this regime that the penalties associated with the discharge offences are sufficiently severe to prevent discharges of pollution. This amendment ensures that Queensland’s marine and coastal protection regime has appropriate penalties consistent with the highest rate of penalty applied by the Commonwealth, other states and the Northern Territory.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053265"></A>
I also want to speak about the amendment which will enhance the prevention of pollution of our pristine coastal waters. Currently, there is no power to prevent a vessel with a potential pollution risk from operating. This amendment allows authorised officers to act when a pollution risk is identified to prevent pollution of our coastal waters. An authorised officer will be able to prevent a ship from operating if there is a risk of pollution and to prevent that ship from operating until the pollution risk has been rectified. The proposed amendments enable Maritime Safety Queensland to undertake appropriate compliance activities to protect our marine environment from ship-sourced marine pollution.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053267"></A>
There have obviously been two recent and high-profile examples of potentially disastrous marine pollution events, with the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 and the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 very fresh in the memories of Queenslanders. Thanks to the speedy and effective action of the Queensland government and federal agencies in both cases, long-term damage was averted. However, every Queenslander has strong views around the protection of our waters and every Queenslander feels very strongly that government should not have to clean up after operators who do not respect our waters and do not take appropriate action to protect our coastline. The aim of this bill is to provide a significant deterrent to operators in that category, and I congratulate the minister for her determination to send that strong message through this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053270"></A>
This bill also seeks to facilitate the restructure and divestment of the businesses of QR Ltd and Port of Brisbane Corporation Ltd. Divestment of these businesses is key to ensuring the future economic stability of Queensland and it is critical that the arrangements that are in place while the transitions take place are beyond reproach. This bill will assist in meeting those requirements. I commend this bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (3.52 pm): I rise to make a short contribution in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. This bill contains amendments relating to the new Queensland driver’s licence project. As members would be aware, what Queensland is doing is introducing a more secure, more durable and at the same time a more credible driver’s licence. The existing laminated driver’s licence has been in use in Queensland since 1986--almost a quarter of a century. Just as the laminated licence product was an improvement on the previous paper licence, the new driver’s licence is an even greater step forward in terms of adopting up-to-date globally accepted technology. The history of licensing in Queensland has been one of recognising and responding to emerging vulnerabilities, and this agility has been critical to its effectiveness. With this in mind, it is time again for a major overhaul to bring the Queensland driver’s licence into the 21st century.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053279"></A>
The new plastic licence card, which is the same size as a credit card, will be embedded with a computer chip which can be used to securely store the cardholder’s product and personal information. It is important to know that this makes it more secure than the plastic magnetic strip used on bank cards and other similar cards the community is already familiar with. However, other security features apart from the card’s computer chip are also significant. These include a range of visual and embedded security measures such as holograms, watermarks, digitised photos and signatures and of course facial recognition technology--all of which contribute to making this the most secure driver’s licence in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053282"></A>
Specifically in relation to the digital photograph, I can advise that every licence holder will be analysed by the use of facial recognition technology software which is used to measure key facial features of a person such as the distance between your eyes, nose and mouth. As such, when Queenslanders apply for their new licence, a digital photograph will be taken and stored centrally. Importantly, at that time their photo will be compared to other photos held by the Department of Transport and Main Roads to ensure there is no other person with those same details. If this is the case, a reproduction of the photograph will be displayed on the card and each time a person renews their licence the facial recognition software will be used to compare their facial features against the photo the department already has recorded for that person. This will help ensure that the person is who they claim to be and is a genuine driver’s licence holder in Queensland, because I am advised that it is practically impossible for two people to share exactly the same facial characteristics, including identical twins, and it makes it incredibly difficult for someone else to come along later to try to obtain a fake licence in your name. This means that these combined features of the new card will make it significantly more difficult to reproduce an authentic driver’s licence and this will contribute to making it the most secure driver’s licence in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053286"></A>
The flow-on advantages of this new technology for Queenslanders are significant. For example, it will prevent people fraudulently obtaining another driver’s licence when they run out of demerit points on one and it will put an end to unlicensed or unqualified drivers with fake driver’s licences and people who have two or more licences so that they can support fraudulent behaviour. In fact, they will be caught. They will be caught because, as previously advised, the technology will take their photo and test whether their face is already held against a driver’s licence. As such, it is planned that this will stop fraudsters in their tracks and get unqualified and dangerous drivers off our roads. This is necessary because it is widely recognised that road safety is compromised when unqualified or disqualified drivers are able to reproduce a licence. As road users in Queensland, I and all Queenslanders should take great comfort from knowing that the new Queensland driver’s licence is making great strides to stop unqualified and unlicensed drivers from using our roads. The message I have for drivers out there with a fake laminated driver’s licence is this: your time is up!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053293"></A>
It is also important to recognise that the new Queensland driver’s licence is only one of five cards being introduced as part of the improvement on the laminated licence card. At the same time the department will also be delivering a new heavy vehicle licence, a new marine licence indicator and a new industry authority card for people including bus and taxi drivers. In addition, a new adult proof-of-age card is being introduced to replace the current 18+ card. This of course will make available a valuable tool for people over 18 years in Queensland who do not hold a driver’s licence to prove their age. In addition, it will also make it even more difficult for under-age drinkers to enter licensed premises using a fake ID.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053296"></A>
Commencing in Toowoomba later this year, it is proposed that the new licence card will be rolled out across Queensland through 2011. This is necessary because, as members can understand, a substantial reform such as this requires a progressive rollout across the state. However, I should also advise that there will be an initial trial from August this year involving Department of Transport and Main Roads staff themselves.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053298"></A>
While the sole purpose for which driver’s licences are issued is an authority to drive, as we know, driver’s licences have also come to be used to establish identity in a wide variety of social, community and financial settings. As such, there have been serious ramifications for personal and financial security when licences can be reproduced fraudulently or stolen to enable a false identity to be assumed. As we all know, identity fraud and theft is escalating across the nation, and Queenslanders are not immune to the personal and financial costs it causes. This is why the introduction of the new Queensland driver’s licence will provide cardholders, businesses and authorities with increased assurance that the card being presented is genuine. That in itself will assist in subsequent savings from a reduction in fraud and identity theft. There will be significant benefits for all Queenslanders flowing from the introduction of the new driver’s licence. As such, I congratulate all of those who have played a part in bringing these reforms to life, in particular the minister. I commend this bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057028"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (3.58 pm): The transport minister has again presented, on behalf of the Labor government, one of those omnibus bills that makes changes to everything from the rapid transit project on the Gold Coast to marine pollution offences. This legislation amends 25 acts and 12 regulations. It revisits the driver’s licence legislation for the third time in a series of embarrassing mistakes and corrections. The marine pollution changes address a series of problems that follow oil spills from vessels that appear to make every nautical mistake that one could manage to make. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057029"></A>
The minister in her second reading speech has said that this bill will deliver three significant reforms: firstly, it will deliver a specific legislative framework for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project; secondly, it will make changes to the marine pollution legislation; and, thirdly, it will create a more robust port planning regime. There is a strange sense of the legislation being written for everything--ranging from being politically driven to providing so-called transport solutions to providing legislation written for problems occurring through incompetence and, even more curiously, writing laws for an industry that the government seeks to sell up and move on from. Critically, the minister highlights these motives for legislative change when she highlights the changes in the bill that facilitate the framework for the future commercial restructure of the Port of Brisbane, the Abbot Point terminal and the sale of Queensland Rail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057032"></A>
The minister states that the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 will be amended to ensure that QRNational maintains its headquarters in Queensland. A 15 per cent shareholding cap is also imposed on any one person or entity or their associates owning stakes in QRNational. The minister either does not appear to be in the loop of what is occurring in the market or is ignorant of it. The combined coal company group, the Queensland Coal Industry Rail Group--that is, QCIRG--appears to be the frontrunner as the natural owner of Queensland’s rail track and the only profitable customer thereof. How much longer they remain profitable under the proposed federal government’s RSPT remains to be seen. Most now are suggesting that we will see no new mines; what we hope for is not to see fewer of our existing mines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057035"></A>
Whilst the Labor government has stated that it wants to sell 60 per cent of Queensland Rail under an initial public offering of more than $3 billion, the market is saying that not only is this price about right but also QCIRG appears to overcome all the potential hurdles that have been placed in its way and that the government agrees with this, too. The minister’s 15 per cent restriction is irrelevant and demonstrates how reality and politics can clearly deliver the same result but attempt to tell a completely different story to the same constituency. Such is life in politics.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057036"></A>
On Monday the market lost $40 billion in Australia, mainly due to the offensive great big tax that is being imposed on our miners and the issue of sovereign risk in Europe. Honourable members, we are a population of 23 million people, an island continent in the Pacific with $100 billion of federal government debt that has been accumulated in just two years and, worse, our future hinges on sales of raw materials to China, where there is a massive bubble in the housing market, and Japan remains in recession. Has anyone considered how rapidly things can change? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057037"></A>
The public will not be big buyers of the stock if the market turns down, and those who might well purchase may well stag in the market as QCIRG soaks up the shares of those mum-and-dad investors, as they are often described. I am sure that the Premier will champion this as the initiator of a future QR. Honourable members, we already own QRNational and selling it to ourselves and then onselling to it QCIRG is not going to make one scrap of difference. In fact, it is likely to cause the opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057038"></A>
The experience of the Canadian coalmining companies under the privatisation of Canadian rail is salient. There is no growth in coal exports in Canada and that has been the case for nearly 10 years. That lack of growth is related totally to what occurred to coal mining, exporting and processing in Canada under a change of ownership of rail from government to private. As at 2004, when the last resources boom kicked off, growth is stagnant at two per cent and remains so, compared with Australia’s growth of 20 per cent, and which continues to grow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057040"></A>
The best example is Teck in Canada, which is the largest mining house in Canada and one of the biggest in the world. Teck owns the second largest exporter of coking coal--which is essentially used in the manufacture of steel and which is what 80 per cent of Queensland coal goes towards--and that is known as Elk Valley Coal. Elk Valley mines are entirely dependent on rail to transport coal to their customers. There is no competition for rail services at any Elk Valley mines. Each mine is captive to the carrier that services it. Businesses such as those in the Elk Valley are held back from competing owing to the exercise of railway market power. The main beneficiaries of Canadian privatisation--the most commonly quoted comparison of QR and this Labor government--have been the rail companies, which have increased their share prices and capitalisation to the detriment of the coal industry. This issue is quoted in the <Hansard-Italic>
AFR</Hansard-Italic>
 and has also been referred to by the current head of the Queensland Resources Council, Michael Roche. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057044"></A>
So there is the evidence on the basis of the chosen model of the state Labor government itself. Not only does the model not work in practice; it drives down growth when combined with the double whammy of the not-thought-through RSPT of the federal Labor government. The end result is to drive down state income, not just in royalties from coal and the income from rail freight but also from the loss of the critical asset that drives our state’s income. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057045"></A>
The Queensland Treasurer does not care who buys the asset as long as he gets his hands on the $3 billion from QR. He is aiming for a float in November or December 2010. That is despite knowing that a privatised QR will not fund major investment in the crucial coal export chain. His model will see coal companies build their own infrastructure and own and operate it. In 12 years, Asciano Group’s Pacific National now holds 15 per cent of the market share in Queensland. Today, it has proposed a link with Conzinc Riotinto--the old CRA which is now Rio Tinto and others--in a joint bid for QR if it can pass the competitive test. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057049"></A>
The Treasurer thinks that the government regulatory adjustment will offer choice to drive future expansion. Foolishly, he fails to read and study what has occurred elsewhere. He and the transport minister are using regulatory change in this bill to reduce a big cash-flow-positive business that we have in Queensland to a much smaller shipping proportionately but massive cash-flow-positive business that is owned by others. In doing so, we get back $3 billion on a business that yields 14 per cent conservatively at present, but we will strangle all our future mining development. And here in Queensland we are very reliant on resources, particularly at this time. This is at a time when the federal government is going to be taking away our capacity to charge royalties on every tonne of mined ore from the very first tonne of ore mined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057050"></A>
Who is giving this minister, this Treasurer and Labor advice? They are fooling themselves if they have been convinced by the argument that it is better to own 40 per cent of a bigger earning monopoly than 100 per cent of a monopoly player in a growing competitive market. To my way of thinking, that reads far too much into the Telstra saga. The maths of this argument are defeated by fact. If the market only doubles and QR is to have only 30 per cent of that in the market--because there will be other players--it will earn that $3 billion within four years on top of its current income, even after factoring in the cost of capital to fund that growth. But Queensland, when it controls QR, gets two further bites of that cherry. It gets rising royalties, assuming that the RSPT fails, and even if it does not the royalties rise as the market grows. Queensland can also manage the problem that occurs with freight--which occurs in Canada and the US--where the government, having lost control of the rail, has to compete on the same rail to move freight. In other words, it cannot do it on time. This opportunity for a sale of these assets is a no-brainer and that is why we in the LNP oppose it. </Hansard-Body>

This bill goes even further by regulating the changes relating to ports. The bill amends the existing regime in relation to port charging and control powers to allow the Port of Brisbane to be managed by a private sector entity. The amendments in this bill merely facilitate these changes. Similar arguments about the sale of ports can be raised along similar lines to that relating to the sale of QR, which I have raised today, especially at a time when there is massive growth in the market, and especially here in Queensland during the ongoing resources boom, which continues. These changes are completely unnecessary, because selling assets as listed is short-sighted and financially naive and is an action representative of desperate men and women. These are quality assets. To sell a majority share of a high-yielding asset in a growing market to fund recurrent expenditure makes no sense, because these are the very assets that will drive the capital required to fund progressive debt reduction in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060578"></A>
Assets to be sold should be primarily those incapable of earning income surplus to requirements, infrastructure linked to businesses that are no longer core businesses or where the price multiples offered in favour of those assets are vastly in excess of the capped value rate. These are standard business practices in managing assets. Large capital assets such as rail have also been considered once-in-a-generation--that is, one in 50 years, one in 100 years for some--investment opportunities. Warren Buffett, who is acknowledged as one of the world’s greatest investors, waited 30 years to buy Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. He paid $US26 billion--60 per cent was cash and 40 per cent was in a share swap. Unlike trucks, rails do not have to compete on congested highways. Nor do railroads depend on cash-strapped governments to maintain infrastructure. They are the only mode of freight transport that can handle the growth in markets. Only shipping and porting in terms of efficiencies come close. And here we are talking about selling our ports at the same time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060582"></A>
Our lack of coastal shipping services, particularly in Queensland due to the improbable demands of the MUA, merely has meant that rail is the only clear alternative. Our ports represent our only real link to the global markets. QR is probably the best hard asset we have. It is so poorly managed that even if it looked nothing like Canadian National or Union Pacific in the USA, nor Burlington Northern for that matter, if it was managed in the same manner it would be a class one stock. US rail stock such as Union Pacific, SCX, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern are the ones that we should try to replicate. They are each worth over $US30 billion in the market and they carry very little capital debt. We can potentially have a $30 billion asset over the next 10 years in QR. Separated from QR Passenger, it is my measured assessment that currently it is worth probably twice what it is being sold for but in seven to eight years three or four times that in the market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060583"></A>
This can easily be calculated in multiple ways, but the best way to do it, because of the quality of the asset, is pricing it using class one stocks in rail, correcting for their market and adding a 6 per cent yearly compounding uplift. On that calculation we are looking at a $25 billion entity within that 10 years with a $5 billion capital debt since rail is a capital intensive activity. With no new highways or ports and population growth in Australia of 5 per cent, economic growth at 3 per cent, which has come out in the latest reports from the Commonwealth, and potentially a 50 per cent growth--that is by tonnage, and that is very conservative in coal transport in Queensland--in eight to 10 years, the future for rail in Queensland is remarkable. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1060584"></A>
Australia and Queensland are no different from Canada and the US. By copying the Canadian model rather than the US model we risk killing off that which we need to fully repay our future debt and current debt demands. The state Labor government in the minister’s speech champions the government’s record of investing in infrastructure to improve the public transport system. She rightly points to the complexity of projects, advancing technology, complex urban footprint and the scale of capital investment. Labor’s record is appalling. It failed to build the second crossing of the Downs to facilitate the massive expansion of road freight into Brisbane when we needed that income. It strangled development, similarly from lack of investment, on the Mount Isa to Townsville railway line just as the port was massively expanding. We are seeing the port having to stop for up to a week because of simple derailments. I point out these examples because they have led to cash haemorrhaging from state coffers in big leaps. The minister either does not know or does not understand the scale of this problem. Australia and Queensland have major engineering companies who have a proud record of international construction. The debacle at Tugun on the bypass is the most defining method of understanding how to quantify the failure of this state Labor government to be able to build, conceive and do anything. </Hansard-Body>

The Gold Coast Rapid Transit system is also considered within the bill. The government strangely is championing it as a green product. I am not exactly certain why that is the case. It is debatable whether the project will really achieve anything like that which is being predicted by this government and the current cheer squad who are supporting it. </Hansard-Body>

 I will get to that, Minister. Whatever the frailties and the questions about the process and the business case, the project is being rolled out with an end target date of 2016 for $1.8 billion with a $380 million now federal government grant. This bill facilitates the government’s dream of a private partnership project. That is really what I want to get to. This is a forlorn dream because PPPs as they were originally proposed are a dead duck. The private entity partner is not prepared to take the risk without guaranteed income. If the government does not give an income guarantee who else will? The rapid transit light rail project is neither light nor rapid and it is arguable whether it will carry the number of people proposed, nor take 75,000 cars off the coastal strip each day as is proposed. It is electric powered by ugly overhead lines, but it is quiet. It is slower than buses and nowhere in the world has it come close to returning anything like its investment. In a tourist city we need to move people along the linear arteries with a progressive approach to route selection incorporating a route that goes down Surfers Boulevard to Broadbeach. We really need to link to Helensvale to make it a proper solution and the bridge at Southport needs to be strongly considered. </Hansard-Body>

There are changes relating to the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995. I do sympathise with everyone, but there was too much emphasis on the politics of oil leaks, too much delay in taking action and far too much blame shifting.

The <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1 </Hansard-Italic>
issue arose because too many piloted ships were taking a known possible high-tide shortcut south of the main channel through the reef. The ship’s captain apparently had no navigational skills to rely upon. Too many still think the reef is a line of reefs. It is not. It is a series of inner and outer reefs with channels in between so the tide can move through. It is obvious to all, and many confessionals were reporting, that ships were not using the correct channel and were in this so-called channel that was an occasional one south of Douglas Shoal. Action should have been taken at this stage and enforced. The <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1 </Hansard-Italic>
would never have steamed along at full power into that known shoal if it had been forced and knew that it could not go there because there would be a huge penalty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060590"></A>
The monitoring was unsatisfactory and it needs to be corrected. The <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 relates to a failure of correct shipping management, a lack of honesty from the captain and crew and government focusing the response on the politics of the matter and focusing on PR with flyovers and a failure to plan. There was no prepared action for all eventualities as should have occurred coming out of Hamilton. We have used the port for nearly 200 years. All good transport operations rely on ideal partnerships. We are greatly reliant on the goodwill of all involved. Governments, just like operators and staff, all have major responsibilities in equal measure. </Hansard-Body>

The penalty issue of the marine act in this transport bill looks to me like they are attempting to paper over some serious issues of failures involved in the <Hansard-Italic>

John Swire &amp; Sons, a venerable Scottish Chinese trading, shipping and banking company, is a major Queensland partner and has been so for 200 years.

The sale of rail and road as planned by this fire sale announced after the last election has not been thought through. I have given the reasons based on the models the government itself built its plan on, on the basis of known facts. As usual, the devil is in the detail. The yield of the assets is insufficient to make up for the loss of the asset. As usual, Labor is betting against the market. It is a logic that is driven far too much by political expediency and not enough by hard data. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (4.18 pm): I rise to join the debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 which was introduced into the House on 15 April by the honourable Minister for Transport. This legislation presents the parliament with an omnibus transport bill of significant size and varied content that amends 25 acts and 12 regulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064312"></A>
The key objectives of the bill are to facilitate the restructure and divestment of the businesses of Queensland Rail Ltd and Port of Brisbane Corporation Ltd and implement transitional arrangements in preparation for their scheduled privatisation, and also to amend the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 to provide a clear framework to engage and operate a franchise public-private partnership for stage one of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064316"></A>
Provisions in this bill also make minor amendments to the Transport (New Queensland Driver Licensing) Amendment Act 2008 relating to emergency contact information included in new Queensland driver’s licences and adult proof of age cards. Amendments to the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 will make the record keeping requirements for limousine bookings the same as the current requirement for special purpose limousine bookings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064318"></A>
As honourable members have heard from the shadow minister and honourable member for Maroochydore, the LNP will offer its guarded support for this bill with some reservations and opposition to some clauses. The shadow minister clearly outlined the LNP’s concerns regarding the asset sales, new driver’s licences, extended tolling powers and other contentious issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064319"></A>
This bill addresses a number of administrative provisions required for the sale of QR Ltd and the Port of Brisbane Corporation Ltd. I am hard pressed to recall many other actions by premiers--or prime ministers for that matter--in recent years that have incensed people so much and for so long. The current payroll debacle that Health workers are suffering, which has entered its fifth payroll cycle, has simply added fuel to this highly charged atmosphere that would toss this Bligh Labor government out should an election be called. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064320"></A>
From the moment the Premier revealed her sneaky, underhanded decision to pull the privatisation rabbit out of the hat straight after the early state election in March 2009, I like hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders felt cheated. Intense anger has transformed into deep-seated public outrage and hatred--and I do not use that word lightly here--towards the Premier and her spineless bunch of ministers and elected state members. My office, along with those of members from both sides of this parliament, has certainly experienced the wrath of the voting public through the inundation of emails, explosive phone calls, pointed letters and, of course, face-to-face confrontations, all expressing anger over this Bligh government’s deceit of the people of Queensland. Even diehard Labor unionists have contacted me citing their rage and also their feelings of shame towards this government’s underhanded policy to supposedly whittle down the massive debt of its very own creation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064323"></A>
In reality, this is not an issue of privatisation. Rather, it is an issue of debt. The Treasurer tells us an expected $15 billion will be raised by the sale of the five assets, leaving a debt of over $90 billion still to repay. As we have stated on record numerous times, the LNP is not opposed to privatisation of assets per se, but we are opposed to Labor’s appalling attempt to reduce the debt that it and it alone has forced upon the good people of the state of Queensland. The lack of honesty and integrity displayed by the Premier in this instance will mark her forever in history as a Premier who deceived the voters of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064325"></A>
As mentioned in my reply to the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill on 18 June last year in relation to the sale of government assets, there are three major conditions that should be met. Firstly, the asset should only be sold if it can be subject to competitive conditions as private monopolies are no more attractive than public monopolies; secondly, the cost and productive capacity of the asset to be sold must be in sound condition; and, thirdly, the buyer must be able to demonstrate the ability to maintain price levels at the price offered for the assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064326"></A>
But do not take my word for it. Industry experts flocked to point out the flaws of the Labor government’s fire sale of Queensland assets. One commentator wrote in the <Hansard-Italic>

 on 5 November 2009 that he was shocked by the commercial naivety of the Premier. He continued--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064327"></A>
If there is one thing we have learned in the last 30 years it is that privatisation is of great benefit when it involves government firms operating in competitive industries ... but the sale of intact monopolies or near monopolies is almost invariably a disaster. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064328"></A>
What are the assets pinned for sale by the Bligh government? Monopolies. That is what they are. I quote this gentleman further when he says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064329"></A>
The sale of a monopoly is simply borrowing by other means.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064330"></A>
The government may pocket the cash from this sale, but it is the citizens of Queensland who will be left paying off the debt for decades to come. It is our children and grandchildren who will inherit this massive encumbrance.</Hansard-Body>

I turn now to focus on the provisions of this bill that address light rail, specifically the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project. With passage of this bill, amendments will be made to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 and subsequent amendments made to the Land Act 1994 to incorporate the new definitions of busway land and light rail land for the purposes of this legislation. The provisions in this bill define the structure of light rail franchise agreements and particulars relating to busway and light rail land and infrastructure. Considering the impact that this project will have on the homes and properties of many Gold Coast residents along the prescribed route, there are a number of clauses in this bill that may not have sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert No. 6 of 2010 </Hansard-Italic>
makes reference to these in detail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064334"></A>
I do speak here with some authority, having fought for the rights of residents in my electorate whose homes and livelihoods were detrimentally affected by the construction of the Tugun desalination plant. I sincerely hope that lessons have been learnt in the treatment of such residents, that their concerns will be listened to and that the appropriate procedures will be followed by this government, but I very much doubt it. The $1 billion plus Gold Coast Rapid Transit project was given an injection of funds from the federal government’s 2010-11 budget announcement, seeing $365 million approved as a grant--not an equity contribution--providing the kick-start the project needed. Funds to the tune of $949 million have been received from all three levels of government to proceed with stage one works. The remainder, I understand, is to come from the private sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064336"></A>
In the 2008 draft concept design and impact management plan prepared by TransLink, the route between Broadbeach and Griffith University was highlighted as highest priority and was said to be needed by 2011. That is only next year, for honourable members who are counting this. Yet incompetence from this lacklustre state government and its federal Labor counterpart over funding saw the time line pushed back. Now the delivery date of 2014 is being trumpeted by the Premier for the 13-kilometre stage one corridor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064337"></A>
However, Gold Coast Mayor Ron Clarke has expressed concern that this project cannot be fully installed given the number of serious challenges ahead. Although the decision for light rail has been made and agreed upon, there is still considerable debate as to whether light rail is the best option or model for the Gold Coast and whether bus rapid would have been a wiser choice. I remind the government that what we need to have is a whole-of-Gold Coast integrated solution and so far not everyone is convinced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064338"></A>
According to information in the 2008 draft concept plan, some 71 per cent of people on the Gold Coast do support light rail while 29 per cent supported the bus rapid option. Even though those figures would indicate public opinion has leaned heavily towards the light rail option, there is conjecture among some business leaders that debate was stifled and presentations from the bus rapid group were prohibited in some sectors. I can attest that very little, if any, consultation was done in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064339"></A>
I was told recently by council officers that modelling figures were quoted on people utilising the light rail service from a distance of 800 metres when in actual fact other studies have shown that 400 metres is a more accepted distance that people would be prepared to traverse in order to utilise this mode of transport. Furthermore, plans for the section between Burleigh Heads and Coolangatta, through my electorate, are not even on the horizon until 2026-2041, according to the 2008 plan. Northern and western routes will take preference over the Burleigh to Coolangatta section. Not surprisingly, the southern Gold Coast looks set to miss out again. Doubts have already surfaced as to the physical possibility of the southern section which adjoins the New South Wales border ever getting access to the system. There are legitimate concerns that the system’s infrastructure will strike an intractable situation that would prevent the crossing of the hill at Burleigh and no alternative route can be identified to overcome this. Perhaps when the minister sums up she will be kind enough to allay those fears. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067995"></A>
Whilst it might be good news for northern and central Gold Coast suburbs, it would appear that my area will not be so lucky. There cannot be a bill about delivering transport infrastructure without mentioning the neglect of my electorate of Currumbin by successive Labor state governments. We welcome funding for new projects, but why should it come at the expense of more vitally important projects, including the heavy rail to Coolangatta, the widening of the M1 to Tugun and improving other local transport routes? After all, this is meant to be an integrated solution. The Gold Coast Rapid Transit project is first on the list of key projects identified in the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009-31, yet the desperately needed widening of the M1 does not feature on the list at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067998"></A>
My concerns for the delivery of light rail are exacerbated by the stalling of construction of heavy rail and the abysmal track record of successive Labor governments in neglecting the growing infrastructure needs of the southern Gold Coast. Members opposite bang on like a broken record about the Nationals ripping up the tracks to Coolangatta some 50 years ago, proving just how tired and behind the times this government is. Public transport needs to be viable, and in the 1950s it was not viable to run half a dozen passengers to Brisbane each weekday. Half a century later, we see the opposite dilemma, with rapid population growth and a government that sat on its hands while South-East Queensland exploded. My electorate is located in the southern reaches of our great state and is the gateway to Queensland, yet it is shunned repeatedly for vital infrastructure upgrades to rail and road. We waited over 20 years for the Tugun bypass, which saw a cost blow-out that was 10 times the 1998 figure. To add insult to injury, funds promised at the last federal election were whisked further north to secure safe Labor seats. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068000"></A>
In support of improved infrastructure for transport options, I wish to remind the House of the sheer number of passengers coming through the Gold Coast airport every year. In 2009 nearly five million passengers came through the gates. To illustrate the numbers further, every day last year we had 60,000 overnight visitors and 16,200 day-trip visitors. That is 76,000 more people contributing to the daily congestion on our overworked roads. Just what will happen if the Gold Coast is successful in its bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games? I dearly hope that we are successful. Visitors will arrive at the state-of-the-art Gold Coast international airport, then they will queue for a bus or scramble for a taxi--we could do with a few more of those, too--and they will be told, ‘Sorry, but there is no train.’ Then they will drive a mere five minutes up the road before reaching the bottleneck that is the M1. Often we have heard the honourable member for Mudgeeraba speak about the bottlenecks on the M1, which runs through her electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068001"></A>
Stage 1 of the light rail between Broadbeach and Griffith University might be complete by 2014, but will it ever reach Coolangatta? Or are we being conned again? The time line for heavy rail has been continuously pushed back, with 2019 the latest prediction for construction to begin on the Elanora station. Add to this the frustration felt when no new funding was announced to extend the M1 widening further south and it is no wonder that residents have little confidence in this Labor government. Why bother to announce dates and funding and draft new regional plans every other year if the government continues to rehash existing funding and push back time lines for much needed projects? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068003"></A>
In its 2010 submission on infrastructure to the Commonwealth government, the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors highlighted the direct improvement that would result from extending the heavy rail from the new Varsity Lakes station to the Gold Coast airport at Coolangatta. There would be an estimated 7,000 fewer car trips per day, which is equivalent to nine per cent of Pacific Motorway traffic volume south of Robina. Considering the population increase of 61 per cent predicted for the Gold Coast by 2031, according to the South-East Queensland Regional Plan, there could not be a more urgent need for this vital infrastructure. Certainly there is a very strong environmental argument here, but it would appear that the Labor government’s credentials, like so many others, are all spin. We must not forget the 17,250 new jobs that could be created, either. This would be a nice little top-up towards the Premier’s promise of 100,000 jobs. A fantastic employment opportunity is practically being thrown away by this short-sighted Labor government and, as I said, there are also environmental considerations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068004"></A>
I move now to the provisions in this bill relating to the new Queensland driver’s licence. The emergency contact information provisions are being transferred to the Transport Planning and Coordination Act 1994. The LNP cannot support an initiative that will bring greater costs to driving a vehicle in Queensland when the government cannot provide answers as to the budget blow-outs, the rollout and the use of these cards. Considering this government’s appalling record with technology and implementing electronic systems--the Health payroll debacle aside, I note the go card fiasco--who would trust this government to implement a device that will electronically store personal information? The government cannot even tell us what information will be stored and who will have access to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068006"></A>
It is not only members on this side of the House who oppose the rollout of these ridiculously expensive cards. Constituents in my electorate have already phoned my office to express their opposition to having highly personal information stored electronically in their driver’s licence. Under this Labor government, driving a car in Queensland has become a rort. With increased registration costs, higher tolls, the introduction of a fuel tax and now licence fees that have jumped 108 per cent, the people of Queensland will never get a break from Labor and Premier Bligh--unless, of course, they vote them out at the next election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068007"></A>
In closing, I wish to make mention of amendments to limousine booking requirements. Previous amendments made by the government under the Transport Legislation Amendment Act in 2007 placed unreasonable restrictions on limousine operators by forcing them to record bookings in an electronic system, disallowing paper records. After subsequent industry consultation, the legislation is now being changed back to the original requirements by proposed amendments in this bill. I remember well when that bill was debated in 2007 and the humiliating and rude comments that were made when the LNP said that this is what would happen. This is simply another example of an out-of-touch Labor government having to change unworkable legislation that restricts small business in Queensland. It is important to recognise the value that limousine companies bring to the Gold Coast, which is a major tourism destination in Australia with some of the worst access to public transport. In fact, where would we be without them? </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (4.37 pm): I wish to make a short contribution in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 and, in particular, public transport. Also I would like to thank my colleague the member for Gregory for allowing me to speak before him. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068013"></A>
In my electorate public transport is something that I am very passionate about. An efficient and well-planned public transport network is the cornerstone of a sustainable community. In late 2009 the Varsity Lakes Railway Station was opened and trains began servicing my electorate. After just five months, the station is used by 600 commuters each day. Local residents tell me that the convenience of having easy access to transport is immeasurable. In fact, at a recent mobile office I spoke to one local commuter who informed me that we have taken almost an hour off his daily trip to Brisbane. It is this sort of vision that demonstrates the Bligh Labor government’s commitment to the long-term growth of the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068014"></A>
The Robina-Varsity Lakes extension was delivered ahead of schedule and represented a significant investment in public transport on the Gold Coast. The project provided jobs for Gold Coasters at a time when employment was scarce and will continue to provide employment with the construction of the associated transit oriented development. To listen to contributions from Gold Coast opposition members, one would think we still used a horse and buggy to travel. They continually point out perceived shortcomings in public transport but conveniently overlook the fact that the rail line to the Gold Coast was pulled up by the Bjelke-Petersen government--a short-sighted decision if ever there was one. Of course, the addition of such a significant piece of infrastructure does have its fair share of teething problems, but I am working with residents, the minister and the department to ensure that this vitally important piece of local infrastructure services the area for many decades to come.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs SMITH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In keeping with the government’s record of investing in public transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast, I was pleased to see in last week’s federal budget a commitment of $365 million towards the rapid transit system, with no strings attached. This light rail project is expected to take 75,000 cars off the road every day by 2016 and is projected to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions by 114,000 tonnes in its first decade of operation. While the first stage of this project finishes at Broadbeach, I am looking forward to its extension to Burleigh Heads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068019"></A>
I am confident we will see a reduction in local traffic and an uptake in public transport use as we increase the efficiency of our public transport network. The Gold Coast presents many challenges in respect of public transport. The sprawling nature of our ever-growing city means that we have not one but several central business districts. There is also an increasing need for east-west services as more and more people realise the benefits of using public transport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068020"></A>
The amendments put forward in this bill mean that the rapid transit system and other important projects can proceed in such a way that local transport infrastructure and the safety of the community are protected. The amendment also enables the state to enter into an operator franchise agreement under a public-private partnership for construction of the rapid transit project. This is good news for local businesses, good news for local workers and good news for local commuters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068021"></A>
Public transport on the Gold Coast requires a forward-thinking and diverse approach in order to meet the needs of everyone from a daily commuter to a student or a pensioner on a weekly shopping trip. The amendments in this bill will ensure that the government has the ability to do just that. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (4.40 pm): This bill makes a number of amendments related to transport improvements in our growing state. The member for Burleigh has just talked about the fantastic initiative of the Bligh Labor government to build the Gold Coast Rapid Transit network, which, as she says, will take about 75,000 cars off the road each day on the Gold Coast by 2016. That, I know, will make a massive improvement to getting around the Gold Coast for all Gold Coast residents and businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068064"></A>
The bill also increases penalties for marine pollution. I think we were all disturbed by the scenes of the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 and the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 over the last 12 months or so and the danger that those incidents presented to our fragile marine environment. So I very much welcome the increased penalties which this bill will introduce. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068067"></A>
The main aspect of the bill which I would like to discuss involves the regulation of heavy vehicles such as trucks on our roads. At the outset, I want to pay tribute to the actions taken by the Transport Workers Union and its legendary state secretary, Hughie Williams, over many years to improve the safety of truck driving in this state. For many years, Hughie and his union have put forward the issue of road safety of truck drivers and the general public, and they have had a lot of successes along the way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068069"></A>
For too long, too many truck drivers have been forced to drive for periods of time that are unreasonably long and plain unsafe. In many cases drivers do not do this willingly. They are placed under undue pressure by their bosses to keep on driving beyond a safe driving period to meet unrealistic time frames delivering freight to customers. In the worst cases, truck drivers have actually been provided with stimulants by their bosses to help them stay awake and continue driving well beyond a safe length of time. So it is no surprise that tired drivers are unsafe drivers. They end up being a menace on the roads to themselves and to the rest of the driving public. Too often we have seen tragic crashes involving fatigued truck drivers and cars or buses on our highways. We must do everything we can to reduce this horrific loss of life, and this bill does just that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068070"></A>
Prior to my election to parliament I worked as a solicitor, and much of my work involved representing truck drivers and other members of the Transport Workers Union. I saw firsthand the terrible conditions that many truck drivers work under. It was my great honour to represent many of those truck drivers in legal proceedings to get a fair day’s pay and better conditions. I am pleased to say that truck drivers’ conditions have improved somewhat since the days when I used to represent them as a lawyer. I pay tribute again to Hughie Williams and the Transport Workers Union for lobbying governments to take action to improve the road safety of truck drivers and the general public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068073"></A>
As well as recognising the role of the Transport Workers Union, I think it is also important to acknowledge the role of this government. This bill is another example of why having a Labor government matters for working people. This government has put through a number of pieces of legislation in this House to improve safety concerning truck driving, including legislation to tackle driver fatigue, speeding and overloading. These safety improvements are delivering results. 2009 statistics show that there were 57 fatalities resulting from heavy vehicle crashes in Queensland. That was 19 fewer than the number of fatalities in the previous year. That is a very good improvement, but obviously 57 deaths are still 57 too many. So we need to do more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068074"></A>
I am pleased to say that this bill does do more. It takes this government’s earlier reforms to transport safety further. It introduces a wider range of enforcement measures which will provide more options to transport inspectors and police officers when they enforce heavy vehicle laws. For instance, it will allow the imposition of conditions on heavy vehicle operators which must be complied with in order to avoid committing an offence. These measures aim to reduce the number of heavy vehicle driving offences and improve road safety for all road users. These amendments are supported by the transport industry, the Transport Workers Union and freight customers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068075"></A>
Many good, hardworking drivers and transport companies in this industry already follow safe work practices. This bill is targeted at the few rogue operators who, in their desperate desire to deliver freight in unrealistic time frames, are prepared to put the lives of their drivers and the general public in danger. There is no place for these operators on our roads, and this bill will make it that much harder for them to pursue their dangerous practices. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (4.45 pm): I am pleased to speak to this legislation. While the opposition will not be supporting many aspects of it, it is an important piece of legislation in many ways, and there are a couple of aspects that I want to speak to. The minister said in her second reading speech, ‘First, it will better facilitate the development of infrastructure to deal with the challenges of a growing population.’ They are great words but there is no backup. We talk about infrastructure that is needed to cater for a growing population. Yes, I realise we have an exploding population here in the south-east corner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068080"></A>
We have heard the Premier over many months now talking about encouraging people to live in regional and remote areas of the state and talking about the need to create an environment for them to relocate to those areas. I supported that and I still support that. But at the same time we have to put in place the necessary infrastructure to cater for the population--whether it is the need for public transport, air travel, bus travel or whatever. We have all of those things in place now, but it is also about having government policy that encourages businesses and other individuals to relocate. That planning has to be done properly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068082"></A>
Somebody said to me the other day that the Department of Planning and Infrastructure does not have a policy at all when it comes to some of these ideals of living outside the south-east corner. The important point is that if some of that new population growth can be relocated--whether it be along the coastal strip or whether it be to some of the major inland Queensland towns--it will certainly take a lot of pressure off an already overtaxed transport system in South-East Queensland and other social infrastructure like education, hospitals, police and so on. I think that is what it is about. Good government is about identifying how you can make those improvements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068086"></A>
I support the concept of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit network. It is a very important part in addressing population explosion in an already built-up area that needs public transport further enhanced in conjunction with a substantial Gold Coast rail system that is overtaxed. More rolling stock is needed there. I know the government is doing its best to do that. The Gold Coast rail system needs more railway carriages to meet the people’s needs in that corridor. It is the same with the urban system here in Brisbane and it is the same on the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068091"></A>
Where is the mention of CAMCOS on the Sunshine Coast? That seems to have died and been buried. CAMCOS is a very integral part of passenger rail transport on the Sunshine Coast and it is something that is not going to go away. I say to the minister here today that, if we are fair dinkum about addressing the needs of public transport, CAMCOS has to be fast-tracked and it has to be interfaced with the heavy rail and urban system of Brisbane and the Gold Coast right through to the Sunshine Coast. That system is absolutely paramount to the future development of a good, safe transport network in South-East Queensland. The former CEO of Queensland Rail, Vince O’Rourke, had that vision. When I was minister, we certainly worked towards the goal of achieving the Sun-Gold concept, which was having a rail network that ran from the Sunshine Coast to the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072243"></A>
I urge the minister to exercise her muscle in cabinet and in government to make sure this concept is up and running before the due date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072244"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Rickuss:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Muscle up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072245"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Muscle up is the word. We are talking about something that is 15 or 16 years down the track. I have heard the shadow minister for transport and main roads make reference to this issue on numerous occasions. I have counselled members in the Sunshine Coast region who talk about public transport issues on this matter. The Gold Coast Rapid Transit project is a great project. It will interface with rail and carry many passengers in that corridor. That is all very well but at the same time we have to see that line extended right through to Coolangatta. We need to get the system working so we do not see the Pacific Motorway overtaxed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072248"></A>
This afternoon I heard the member for Currumbin mention the Pacific Highway corridor. Whilst it costs a lot of money to build roads in the south-east region--I am well aware of that and understand that very well--the issue is the conveyance of the general public by the cheapest and fairest means available. We know the CSO obligation placed on Queensland Rail by the Queensland government. It is a huge amount of money. It is probably in the vicinity of $600 million. The minister waves higher. I appreciate the situation that the minister is confronted with on a daily basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072250"></A>
We have to subsidise Queensland Rail to provide the urban passenger system because if we took the system out we would never get anywhere. We now have tunnels open in Brisbane and people are not using them. We have to start to re-educate people and get some fairness into the equation so that we can utilise our transport corridors and our public transport systems to achieve the best outcome for all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072252"></A>
There are many aspects of this legislation that I could speak about but time does not allow me to do that. One area that I do want to talk about is the sale of Queensland Rail. This is an absolutely deplorable situation. We talk about selling off the crown jewels. In a debate on a piece of transport legislation a few weeks ago I talked about the sale of coal infrastructure and the above rail and the below rail part of Queensland Rail’s coal haulage system. I went into Rockhampton the other day. I saw a Pacific National train on the track that was a twisted heap of metal. I do not know whether it is modern art or what it is on the track. It certainly is not a good advertisement for the sale of Queensland Rail’s coal and mineral division. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072254"></A>
I do not know about others but when I go to buy something I drive out and look at what I am going to buy before I engage the agent. I try to have a bit of a look and ask a few questions. If the potential buyers are driving past and see that wreck they will say to somebody, ‘What is going on here?’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072255"></A>
I know that track caved in because of the wet weather we had but potential buyers may not know that. The wet season is a very difficult thing for Queensland Rails’ coal and mineral division to handle, especially in areas up around Coppabella and Jilalan and further south into the Bowen Basin. In those areas they get wet weather and wet tracks. They use diesel electrics in those areas. They can get a square wheel and punch the track down. Before they know where they are the razors are not on the lines above, they lose power and they derail. These are constants on the Queensland Rail coal network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072259"></A>
I say to the minister today that if she wants top dollar for this operation then get rid of the carnage we see along those tracks and fix up the operation so it is a saleable proposition. The real issue is the choking of the lines in the Central Highlands coalfields. Every day one drives along those lines one sees 13 or 14 coal trains sitting at the points; they cannot get through because they are waiting on trains to come in. The freight division is virtually at a standstill. Most of the freight is going on the back of trucks. We see trucks going out to Longreach with the name of the company on it and Pacific National underneath. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072262"></A>
We have trucks hauling freight between Quilpie and Charleville because the rail line is suspended because of the floods. I know the minister is well aware of the representations made to her by the Quilpie Shire Council and Mayor David Edwards. I know it is taking a while to get that corrected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072264"></A>
I have said before in this parliament that if we do not correct this situation and we lose cattle out of the south-west and the Channel Country they will go through to South Australia given the distances to places like Murray Bridge and Naracoorte. It is only 1,200 kilometres to there from Birdsville as opposed to 1,800 kilometres from Birdsville to Dinmore and Beenleigh and other coastal abattoirs. I say to the minister and other members representing the Ipswich region that this is going to impact on the livestock slaughtering progress at abattoirs in the south-east. They rely on the livestock conveyed by the Queensland Rail cattle train network. They feed the cattle into places like Dinmore and Beenleigh. I think the processing chain is going to suffer in time and ultimately jobs will be lost; mark my words. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072268"></A>
We have heard the member for Toowoomba South mention the second range crossing in this House on numerous occasions. He has talked about getting heavy transports through the streets of Toowoomba. There are something like 16 sets of traffic lights. They are hauling coal through the city now. On top of that we have cattle being transported through that city. That is choking the city. I implore the minister to act urgently to correct this situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072269"></A>
This afternoon I heard the member for Everton touch on the issue of heavy transport. I do not always agree with everything that the unions do but I know that Hughie Williams has waged a campaign that has been worth while in bringing about safer driving practices in the heavy transport industry. I think the great percentage of heavy transport operators--probably 98 or 99 per cent of them--are very good operators. They are professional operators. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072272"></A>
The real issue is the chain of responsibility. That chain of responsibility from the consignee to the consigner has to be put in place. People have to be made aware that it is not totally up to the driver. I know the member for Lockyer has talked in this House on numerous occasions about freight coming out of the Lockyer Valley and going to the Sydney markets and the associated deadlines. The driver only has to get a flat tyre on an inside dual or a couple and that will put them behind. They will not meet the Sydney or Melbourne markets. This chain of responsibility legislation has to be further refined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072273"></A>
I say to the minister that the same is applicable to the livestock transport industry. When they load cattle in some of our western areas it is completely impossible to cart those cattle from anywhere further north than Blackall to the markets in the south-east in the time frame allotted. The important thing to remember is that these blokes are professionals. If those cattle are on trucks in the middle of day and it is hot that will not be acceptable. The RSPCA and those types of organisations will not support stock standing around in the midday sun due to the driving hours regulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072276"></A>
I think something that has to be looked at in relation to the livestock industry is where those blokes loaded, whether they are progressing satisfactorily and getting those cattle off. They are not going to be driving against the rules. I know how they operate. I declare this afternoon that I have family in those operations. They are true professionals, as are all those who work in those areas. When we have a situation where they have to push the measure a bit people will revert to foul means. It may be by taking drugs or whatever. That is an area that I want to touch on. It is one issue that still faces the industry and one that is not going away. We saw the former minister for police, the Hon. Judy Spence, introduce legislation about the roadside drug testing of drivers. At the same time, there are not enough qualified police officers around the state to make certain that the heavy transport operators are upholding the law in question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076166"></A>
I advise the minister that the pad just west of Mitchell is totally inadequate. Heavy transport drivers pull up there at any hour of the night and park there for two, three or five hours to rest. Livestock drivers have to drop their third trailer off to run into Roma or Toowoomba. Many times dog-runners cannot even get in there because of the trucks parked there in a disorganised and irresponsible way. This needs a lot of monitoring, and I trust that the minister will talk to Peter Evans at Main Roads in Roma to get this situation corrected. My suggestion would be to allow livestock drivers to go to Mitchell, which is only another six kilometres up the road, and let them unhook there, where there are lights in the yards and what have you, and let the freight drivers do their operation six kilometres out of Mitchell. The sooner we get the road between Mitchell and Roma upgraded the better. I know it is a federal highway and I know there is ongoing work, but it is a real thorn in the side in terms of the conveyance of livestock and other freight from the west and the east through to the north and the south.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076171"></A>
I refer to the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 incident in recent weeks. This situation should never have arisen. I quote the federal trade minister, Simon Crean, when he said that Australia needs a coastguard. No more worthy words were ever said. He said it some time ago in a former opposition capacity. When we think about it, we do need a coastguard to check on those cowboy operators who want to run the Barrier Reef and do the wrong thing. I suppose you could say that it was fortunate that the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 had coal on board and was not loaded with oil. I have to congratulate the department of transport for the way they managed this process and brought about an outcome that has been advantageous to the security and the safety of not only the reef but also the coastal area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076178"></A>
We know what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico at the moment, and it is these types of situations that we want to ensure do not occur in Queensland. It is also very important that the penalties the minister and the government are imposing on these cowboy operators, these ships of shame or whatever they are are carried through. Do not talk tough about it; hit them with the book. That is the greatest deterrent. They know what the corridors are, they know what the shipping channels are and they are playing cunning buggers, if you want to call it that, with the authorities so they can cut off time or beat another ship to get into port. I will back the government all the way in relation to throwing the book at them, because that is exactly what they deserve.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076180"></A>
I turn now to the issue of driver licences. It is unfortunate that it now costs something like $150 for a licence for five years. I have no problem with the five years, but I certainly have a problem with the cost of the licence. Everything seems to be a tax. The government cut out the fuel subsidy of 8.354c a litre. That has become a tax. There are charges on electricity. There are charges on water. There are charges on everything we do. We only have to sneeze and there is another charge! There is an impost on everything we do. This is about trying to curtail the viability of our state and the operators in it who make this a worthwhile and productive state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076182"></A>
A while ago I said in the parliament that we have to be fair dinkum and genuine about the implementation of policy. I congratulate the minister and her department for picking up on an initiative that I mentioned in the parliament the last time we debated a transport bill. That is, the minister will now ensure there is photo identification in taxis in Queensland. That is long overdue, and I will go even further. I also hope that the minister takes control of the training of taxidrivers in Queensland, because it is so very important that we get that sacred industry back to its former great heights. You could catch a cab at any hour of the day or night and be delivered safely to your home. There are problems with the taxi industry in this city and in this state in general and it is an issue that the minister needs to be firmer on. If she is, we will get outcomes that will restore that industry to the great heights it once experienced. We also have to ensure that those people who are in the industry do not see their industry deregulated through an inferior type of operation. Unfortunately my time has expired, but I trust that the minister might take on board some of my initiatives.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (5.05 pm): I am very happy to rise to speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. As the shadow minister has outlined, we certainly support the transport industry and much of this legislation. However, there are quite a few facets contained within this bill that the LNP has concerns about. The provisions in this bill are very wide and varied and some impact on specific geographical areas. There are others, however, such as the new Queensland driver’s licence, asset sales and heavy vehicle reform road safety that have a bearing on the great majority of Queenslanders. The maritime safety and pollution provision is of special note given the iconic status of the Great Barrier Reef and the surrounding islands and shorelines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076190"></A>
The Gold Coast Rapid Transit provisions will see regulatory changes, allowing the government to grant a continuous licence to allow the private sector to be engaged in an operator franchise public-private partnership, with the accepted acronym of PPP. The PPP will be charged with the design, construction, operation and management of stage 1 and presumably the later stages of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit projects. Agreements will be devised allowing ownership agreements to be set up between government and the private sector. The intent of the amendments is to separate light rail land proper from light rail the asset.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076192"></A>
The heavy vehicle reform road safety provision effectively follows national model legislation. As such there is advice that, as this mirrors the model legislation, there really is no need for these regulations. Under this bill, the issuing of improvement notices will be allowed that include improvement conditions or formal warnings to be issued to heavy vehicle operators who do not have a history of breaches. There will also be a provision for courts to provide an order for the heavy vehicle operator to pay for damage to state or local government road infrastructure caused by the heavy vehicle as part of the court’s ruling on the matter. There is an existing administrative power that allows the state government to recover funds. It is noted that the department was unable to advise how these processes would be run concurrently.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076193"></A>
The department was unable to advise regarding the issue of rail infrastructure if a rail bridge was struck by trucks that are over height. The aspect of bridge damage is certainly something that is very close to home for me with the Burdekin Bridge, because in the last couple of years it was hit by a wide load on the back of heavy transport. It has been a very expensive exercise to quantify and to set about undertaking remedial works. As members may be aware, the Burdekin Bridge is a shared rail and road bridge and is a vital link in the Bruce Highway. After this incident there have been numerous bridge closures that have closed the Bruce Highway for many tens of hours, causing scheduling headaches for rail, transport and the general public. Currently the bridge closes several times a day to allow for heavy vehicles to cross. That is sensible, but it does create an impost on the flow of traffic. I do note and am very pleased to see that the main roads department is making moves towards the provision of a second bridge, which is very badly needed. Certainly that need is noted in the community. I certainly support the moves that Main Roads is currently making towards that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083801"></A>
The LNP is concerned about those provisions in the bill that relate to the new Queensland driver’s licence. Although there appear to be some tacit safety attributes to the licence, these attributes are well and truly overridden by the plethora of privacy, access and cost concerns. There has been broad criticism levelled at the introduction of this smart card. The prohibitive cost of the new licence will be a huge impost on the people of Queensland. It is again another cost. The cost of owning and running motor vehicles has received front-page coverage on regional newspapers throughout Queensland. The increased cost of the smart licence, with the dumping of the fuel subsidy and the higher registration fees, will have a huge impact. There seems to be no understanding from those in the metropolitan area that the majority of rural Queenslanders are not afforded the luxury of public transport and that they are required to have a motor vehicle as a means of transport. Queensland has now become the most expensive state in Australia in which to own a vehicle. That is simply not acceptable, when we consider the geographical area of Queensland and the number of people who, by necessity, have to have cars for normal day-to-day transport, such as taking children to school or to hospital, or to go to the grocery shop. For heaven’s sake, for some people a car is an absolute necessity. The fact that the government has chosen the motor vehicle to be its cash cow is totally wrong and cruel for the majority of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083804"></A>
There is also a question mark over the wider use of the card, with the Queensland Police Service recently dismissing the need to have card readers to access any information in the smart card. This is but one example of the wider use of this card that is not required at this time. There are just too many unanswered questions about this costly undertaking of the implementation of this driver’s licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083805"></A>
The provisions of the bill that relate to maritime safety and pollution are quite broad. That is certainly understandable, given the incident that occurred in relation to the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Venturer</Hansard-Italic>
 in Queensland waters and the recent grounding of the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng</Hansard-Italic>
 on the Great Barrier Reef in Commonwealth waters. Certainly, I know the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng</Hansard-Italic>
 has caused concern to the community in the area in question and certainly in the wider community, as it should. It must be noted that, to date, the two reports relating to the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Venturer</Hansard-Italic>
 incident have not received a proper response. As such, outstanding issues that have left our Queensland waters vulnerable for a great length of time after the incident occurred have not been addressed. The amending provisions in this legislation will see penalties in line with those in New South Wales, which currently has the highest penalty framework in Australia. These penalties relate to the discharge of oil, noxious liquid and the jettisoning of harmful substances, such as container cargo. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083808"></A>
There will also be the power to direct ships with defects or noncompliance. These powers have been extended to authorised officers before a potential pollution incident occurs. Under the current legislation, authorised personnel can detain a ship only after a discharge occurs. Also, as the explanatory notes go on to state, the amendment will ensure that vessels that are not appropriately equipped with safety equipment can be directed to a place of safety and will ensure that the vessel and its occupants are not able to remain in an unsafe situation after a marine infringement notice has been issued for failure to be equipped with the necessary safety equipment. The amendment will enhance maritime safety by reducing the exposure of people and property to risk of incident or accident at sea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083810"></A>
Maritime Safety Queensland liaises regularly with Maritime Safety officers about breach and enforcement trends and issues. It will ensure that the power is exercised consistently and only when justified--we hope. The amendment serves to address the current situation, where a marine infringement notice may be issued to a vessel master for the offence of failing to carry the necessary safety equipment and only when justified. An example is that a vessel intercepted in offshore waters and which does not carry an emergency position indicating radio beacon--an EPIRB--will receive a fine for the offence but is unable to be lawfully directed back to the safety of sheltered waters where an EPIRB is not required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083811"></A>
The amendment will broaden the existing powers of shipping inspectors that at sections 171, 172 and 172A provide for the issuing of directions for vessel inspections and breaches of registration and licence requirements to include a direction that deals specifically with contraventions of safety equipment requirements. This is an important improvement for the safety of the people directed. It is also a strong support for the authorised officers who, to this point, have been toothless tigers, which has no doubt been a frustrating exercise for them. It will also prevent the need for broadscale searches if those people continue in harm’s way following the issuance of a marine infringement notice. I am confident that this aspect of the bill will be well received by the broad boating fraternity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083815"></A>
The bill also contains an amendment that will clarify that all fixed toilets on board declared ships must be connected to an on-board sewage holding device. It is further confirmed that such connections are unable to be bypassed, thereby preventing a pollution risk to Queensland coastal waters. Although this amendment will be a financial impost, it is certainly noted that it is necessary.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083816"></A>
 I am very concerned about the port and rail amendments in this bill. These amendments will see the beginning of the end of these entities as we know them. These amendments are the start of realigning and carving up entities as a precursor to these assets being sold off. With Queensland Rail in particular, the list of opponents to the sale is growing. It needs to be stressed that the opposition to the asset sales covers a wide spectrum. There is strong opposition from within unions and key federal Labor ministers have also voiced their criticism. Also, last week a key former federal Treasury official saw fit to criticise this move, as did the Queensland Resources Council. There has been consistent condemnation from the public over the carve-up, especially now, as it would seem, the government is talking up the recovery of the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083817"></A>
Over the past couple of years Queensland Rail has been taking a hard stance against rural business and primary producers. An example of this stance can be found in answer to question on notice No. 1791, which was asked on 12 November last year, relating to gypsum freight rates by Queensland rate. The fact was put in the question that, from 31 December, the applicable rates from Winton to Tully were to increase from $63.59 per tonne to $257.40 and to Ayr from $42.84 a tonne to $217.67 per tonne. The question asked: what measures would be taken to reduce these charges that would jeopardise this western Queensland industry and farmers reliant on the product in North Queensland? The response came back along the lines that 40 per cent of the gypsum was currently transported by rail with the balance by road and that the current pricing and seaonality of this product make it difficult to maintain a sustainable business and, as a result, QR is currently considering reforms to the gypsum services. The harsh reality and lack of empathy then becomes apparent in the next paragraph, which finishes with--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1083819"></A>
These increases are proposed to be implemented from 1 January 2010, but given that volumes are very low or nil in January, February or March, the customers will have up to five months to adjust to the new rates. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083820"></A>
 QR does not fully appreciate that the primary producers utilising the line are not in a position to jack up their sale price to compensate for this increase in the freight charge for gypsum as they are reliant upon the open market price for their produce, which is primarily sugar cane. There are also concerns relating to a lack of capacity and responsibility, which is a sad reflection of the present state of an industry upon which Queensland, and especially rural Queensland, is so reliant. This lack of empathy for the flow-on effects will manifest further should the asset sales be pursued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083821"></A>
There is also a major concern when it comes to the carriage of livestock. In the past, we saw several livestock trains per week. We now see one train per week carrying livestock from Western Queensland through to Brisbane. I have major concerns about many areas of this legislation. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This morning the member for Beaudesert rose on two matters of privilege. During the course of these matters the member presented 34 pages of documents to the parliamentary attendants for tabling. One of the documents the member handed the attendant with the intention it be tabled was three pages of speech notes. These notes included matters that the member did not say verbatim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083863"></A>
I am satisfied that the member handed these to the attendants with the clear intention that they be tabled. Due to the understandable error, the attendants delivered the speech notes to the Parliamentary Reporting Service rather than to the table of the House. These notes should have been tabled and the record will now reflect that they were tabled during the member’s speech. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.21 pm): I rise with a small contribution to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). As the shadow minister has previously stated, this side of the House will be giving this bill guarded support. It is an omnibus bill which covers a broad range of issues. One of the issues that does affect my electorate of Lockyer and is of real concern is the issue of vehicular access to driveways. It is always important to look at aspects of safety, but we also have to ensure that the chief executive does not overstretch his powers. These are quite broad-ranging powers and I ask the minister to assure us that these powers will not be overstretched. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083872"></A>
I have passed on to the minister some information from a constituent of mine, a Mr John Sheehan, about the go card. I am sure that the minister will look into that for me. I do have a meeting tomorrow with some transport officers from the minister’s department about a proposal to run a go card bus service down the Warrego Highway which could complement the limited rail service that we do have now. I thank the minister for offering those bureaucrats to give us their assistance. It is really quite important for some of our areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083874"></A>
The member for Everton talked about trucks and quoted some figures. I agree with him that we all want safer transport on our roads. This is very important. I encourage the Minister for Transport to support more truck stops. In the Lockyer we have a truck stop on one side of the road that is unable to be accessed from the other side. It is on the Gatton bypass. It is just about full every night. There is ample room on the other side for another truck stop to be provided. These are the sorts of facilities that we require so that truck drivers can have a safer working environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083875"></A>
It is also important that we take into account dangerous goods operations. I have two explosives operators in my electorate that transport dangerous goods. They carry out meticulous planning in their operations. If their transports turn up at a truck stop and there is another dangerous goods vehicle there they cannot stop at that truck stop. There are some real anomalies that do need to be worked on. I raised that issue with the Deputy Premier when he was transport minister and he was going to look into it. It is something that needs to be clarified. I realise that with fatigue and weight management and satellite navigation the trucking industry has changed. Some of the major companies track their trucks with satellite navigation so that they understand where they are and what speeds they are driving at. The industry has definitely become a lot safer. The member for Everton quoted figures that supported that. We have to realise that it is imperative on us as governments through private enterprise to provide safe truck stops for the operators to be able to stop safety, have appropriate rest, have a shower, brighten themselves up, have proper food intake and move on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083876"></A>
The former transport minister, the member for Logan, brought in the legislation in relation to the operation of limousines. At the time this side of the House did question whether the electronic booking system was overly onerous. It appears that the record-keeping requirements for limousine booking will go back to the way it was. It was a very onerous situation that was put in place. Many of these limousine operators are very small operators with one or two vehicles. They do not have the technology that we are talking about here, but they do provide a very good service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083877"></A>
There are other issues of concern in relation to the consultation process. Most of the consultation did appear to be purely with government departments. I feel that consultation could have gone out to private enterprise. It was not as thorough as it could have been, particularly when one thinks about what is happening to those freehold landholders with some of the regulations that are being put in place. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (5.26 pm): I rise to speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and put on the record my appreciation of departmental staff at the briefing today. I was late and I apologise for that. The bill covers quite a number of issues and the first one that I will deal with and I will be opposing is the restructure of Queensland Rail and the Port of Brisbane to allow for the privatisation and sale. I oppose it on principle. I understand that the restructure per se is not the sale, but my electorate remains 100 per cent, if not more, opposed to the sale. Actually, that is wrong. It is 95 per cent opposed to the sale, because I think there are a couple of AWU people who are supporting it. There has only been one person not involved in the organised movement, either for or against, who has said to me that they support it and it was a fairly off-handed comment. It was, ‘Oh well, I suppose if they’ve got to sell it.’ It certainly was not a statement of conviction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083880"></A>
I do understand that the first part of this bill restructures Queensland Rail to separate Queensland Rail Passenger from Queensland Rail Freight and that will facilitate the privatisation. The other area that is involved is the restructure of the Port of Brisbane. There are three specific areas--control powers, the planning and the charging regimes--all of which are currently in existence but they have to be restructured to allow for a private entity to either own or lease for a long period of time. I want to place on the record that this bill will restructure the port facilities. There is an extensive list of areas that qualify as port facilities. These include, obviously, wharf and port marine operational areas and shipping channels within port limits; marine and port structures; berths and berth pockets; ship-building facilities and dry docks; offshore structures used for shipping purposes; wharf protection devices; hydraulic structures; bulk loading and unloading facilities; boat harbours and boat ramps; vehicle and railway ferry terminals; oil and liquid product terminals and other terminals within the port area; access roads and rail corridors; roads, access corridors and flyovers; conveyors; pipelines; weighbridges; monitoring facilities; security facilities; communication facilities; material handling or disposal areas; vehicle parking facilities; an airport; public, community and visitor facilities; partially completed reclamation areas in areas designated as future strategic port land; and partially completed port facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087990"></A>
They were all the examples given of port facilities. I know that this bill specifically talks about the port of Brisbane. However, my area has a major port and it would be good for the workers in my electorate if the minister could reaffirm that the port of Gladstone is not up for grabs. When we look at that list of what port facilities include it really does involve and include a lot of jobs and a lot of people who are employed in port and allied activities. So those in the community who are concerned about this sale are justified when they say that a lot of people will be affected by this proposal. I could not in all conscience in this chamber support this part of the bill which facilitates the privatisation of the port and QR coal freight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087993"></A>
The bill also deals with busways or light rail. This is not proposed for my electorate, but I certainly valued the briefing that clarified the breadth of tenures that will have to be dealt with and certainly the fact that, when the legislation was drafted in relation to these sorts of facilities, it did not envisage private-public ownership or private ownership. So some work has to be done to allow for a new perspective, if you like, in infrastructure provision. It is certainly necessary for a private investor to have security of tenure. I think the provision of new infrastructure such as new buses or light rail is a different kettle of fish--I know it is a separate section of the bill, but it is a different situation to consideration of the privatisation of existing infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087994"></A>
The bill also deals with the amendment of the adult proof of age card and the storage of emergency contact information electronically. During the briefing it was clarified that this storage is not mandatory and that the applicant or the holder of the card would have to apply to the chief executive officer to allow the information to be stored. I have expressed concerns over a long period in relation to the protection of the privacy of information on some of these licences. I know when they were first mooted a huge amount of information was going to be stored on the card including health information and quite significant detail about the individual. The question was asked, ‘How will a person’s privacy be protected?’ and the reply was that only certain people will be able to access the machines to read this. However, the reality is that criminals are incredibly inventive people. They are also manipulative and deceptive and they will get their hands on these card readers. Therefore, I think great care has to be taken in relation to what is stored on licences that are so transportable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087996"></A>
The Maritime Safety Queensland Act is also being amended to allow for the moving of certain public servants to MSQ. I raised with the officers at the briefing that several years ago marine pilots were moved from the ports to MSQ. In that transfer, certainly in the debate in this chamber, it was envisaged that there would be no loss of entitlement, no disadvantage to any of the pilots. I have raised with a previous minister for transport the details of a constituent in my electorate who felt that he was significantly disadvantaged. We did not get a positive result in that instance. He certainly did feel that he was significantly disadvantaged. The difference that the minister’s officers clarified was that in this bill there is a right of reversion, and that is a very important safeguard. I commend the minister for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087997"></A>
The second last issue that I want to deal with is the amendment of the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act. This relates to state waters. There is other legislation that deals with Commonwealth waters. Because of the relationship between state and Commonwealth waters, there must be a working relationship between the two entities. The incident with the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 I believe was the beginning of the review of this legislation and resulted in the increase in penalty units--and they have certainly been increased significantly. That review particularly deals with the spillage of bunker oil and transported or cargo oil. We have had an incident in my electorate right in the port. It was not a grounding in the sense of running aground on the Great Barrier Reef, but it was certainly an incident where oil escaped. It has significant implications not only in relation to the actual rupture of the vessel but also for marine creatures, birds and any other wildlife. Potentially, it has long-term implications in terms of the fishery’s ability to revive and things like recreational and commercial fishing. So it is important that people who are plying our waters understand that we take that safety seriously and that we expect that they will value our marine ecology as much, if not more, than we do because they are often visitors to our waters. So the increase in the penalties was welcome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088000"></A>
However, it was pointed out that the most likely pollutant that this legislation and, indeed, authorised officers will deal with is actually sewage out of recreational and commercial vessels. The legislation already has an outline of the vessels that have to comply with regulations in relation to the disposal of sewage. I asked the question: what sort of problems are these boats or these vessels causing? If they reach that threshold of needing a toilet and they are a recreational vessel, there are some really good commercial porta-potties around. One of the minister’s officers said some of them just get a little bit too clever and they expel raw sewage straight from the vessel. That certainly would not be acceptable to our community. It is not acceptable full stop, but it is even more unacceptable when there is such a viable alternative and quite an economic alternative that does not impact on the waterways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088002"></A>
The difference, I am given to understand, is that this legislation gives authorised officers the powers to direct a subject vessel to return to the port if the authorised officer genuinely believes that there is a risk of polluting. Previously they did not have that power to direct them back to the port. I think most people in our community would agree that is quite an acceptable exercise of power if it is done objectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088004"></A>
The only other issue that I want to raise is the changes to the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995 to include some preliminary--and I am not sure if that is the right word--warnings and interaction with heavy vehicle operators in relation to the issuing of formal warnings and improvement notices. I note that the improvement notices would take the place of having to put a truck in particular off the road because perhaps the trailer no longer complied because of damage from the product that it carries. In this case the trailer itself is not unroadworthy but it has fallen out of compliance because of wear and tear. In that situation the improvement notice will give the officer the opportunity to issue the improvement notice with a time frame for rectification. In this highly commercial time when many of the operators who run truck fleets are running close to the bone in terms of their finances, that will be greatly welcomed by them. It is a practical approach to a problem that occurs over time. They will still be able to operate and the minister’s department will still be able to ensure that that operator complies with the legislation in a timely manner. I commend the minister for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088005"></A>
The only other amendment raised with me relates to changes to the limousine legislation. It was transferred to electronic booking only and will revert back to electronic or paper. If something is shown not to work, it is a big thing to go back and say, ‘We got it wrong, we are going to change it; we will go back to what was tried and true in the past.’ I commend the minister for that. I will be opposing those parts of the legislation that deal with privatisation, because overwhelming my electorate is opposed to it. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1092041"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (5.40 pm): I rise to make a short contribution to the debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill is about delivering a relevant transport legislative framework for a modern Queensland. This bill responds to the contemporary challenges of population growth in respect of the delivery of public transport infrastructure. This bill also strengthens marine environment protections to further dissuade irresponsible and reckless behaviour on the part of marine vessel operators and owners. In addition, this bill introduces strong protections and mechanisms for the ownership structures of the Port of Brisbane, Abbot Point Coal Terminal and QRNational. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092043"></A>
The amendments contained in the bill are good amendments that protect Queensland’s interests and provide value to Queenslanders. This Queensland Labor government has a tremendously proud record of delivering infrastructure for Queensland. Most recently, this record was highlighted by the fact that the new Gateway Bridge, worth $1.88 billion, has been completed ahead of time and under budget. Locally, the people of Morayfield state electorate are pleased to see additional car-parking facilities being installed at the Morayfield train station and the Burpengary train station. Those projects are concrete proof of this Labor government’s commitment to infrastructure construction around Queensland for the benefit of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092044"></A>
In respect of this bill, I would like to speak particularly about the proposed amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act and the Transport Planning and Coordination Act. These amendments will ensure the ongoing maintenance, safety and operational integrity of Queensland’s transport infrastructure and the public transport network. These amendments are essential to the future of transport and public infrastructure planning and construction in Queensland. These amendments modernise our planning and construction legislative frameworks for a modern Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092047"></A>
Specifically, this bill provides the chief executive of the Department of Transport and Main Roads with the power to give a written direction to stop, alter or not start works that the chief executive reasonably believes threaten or are likely to threaten the safety or operational integrity of transport infrastructure. Further, the chief executive will have the power to register an administrative notice on the title of a property regarding works that the chief executive believes may adversely impact on the safety or operational integrity of transport infrastructure. It is important to note that the registration of an administrative notice will not prevent particular works on land. Instead, this will enable the Department of Transport and Main Roads to work with landowners to ensure works do not adversely impact the operational integrity of transport infrastructure. These amendments are about ensuring public safety and the efficiency of the public transport network throughout Queensland and should be welcomed by all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092048"></A>
As a strong advocate for public transport services and public transport infrastructure, I am pleased that this bill contains amendments that support the delivery of a light rail system in South-East Queensland. The Gold Coast Rapid Transit light rail system may be some distance from the Morayfield state electorate, but nonetheless it will deliver a great service to the people who live on and visit the Gold Coast. This project will be delivered as a public-private partnership and will be the first light rail system in Queensland for some time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092049"></A>
The amendments set out in this bill are about providing a transport legislative framework for the future--a framework that protects the Queensland environment; a framework that allows public transport infrastructure to be planned and constructed in an effective way and responds to the contemporary challenges of a modern Queensland; and a framework that further facilitates the transformation of the Queensland of today to a productive, strong and proud Queensland of tomorrow. I commend the minister, her staff, the departmental staff and the Parliamentary Counsel on their work in respect of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092051"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (5.45 pm): I rise in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010, in particular those provisions relating to the new measures designed to increase compliance with heavy vehicle laws. These provisions are based on the national compliance and enforcement reform package. In 2003 Queensland was at the forefront in developing this national reform package, which was modelled on the Queensland legislation. The amendments in the bill before the House today are the next instalment in an integrated plan for improving heavy vehicle safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092052"></A>
To the south and in the heart of my electorate there are a number of industrial estates at Sumner Park, Darra and Seventeen Mile Rocks. There is increasingly heavy vehicle traffic going to and from those estates via Monier Road, Westcombe Street, Sumners Road, Wacol Station Road, Oxley Road and Seventeen Mile Rocks Road. Heavy vehicle traffic also continues to use Harcourt Road as a shortcut to the Ipswich Motorway, yet Brisbane City Council continues to ignore the problems on those local roads, where safety issues are a major concern near residential areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092060"></A>
The bill includes the following components: new standards for compliance to mass, dimension and load restraint requirements; new standards for effective fatigue management; new standards for speed compliance; new powers to allow authorised officers to effectively enforce the standards; and, finally, new measures that allow authorised officers more flexibility through collaborative working with industry to improve voluntary compliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092061"></A>
As the Queensland economy starts to grow in the wake of the global financial crisis, there is an inevitable increase in freight and heavy vehicles on the roads. Heavy vehicles on major roads, including the Centenary Highway and the Ipswich Motorway, particularly where they run through our suburbs, cause noise nuisance, especially with drivers frequently using their air brakes unnecessarily. Locals feel that this issue needs more attention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092062"></A>
With more freight to be moved, the road industry faces ever-increasing pressure to deliver more in less time. With the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics estimating that by 2020 one in four vehicles on Queensland roads will be a commercial vehicle, this government is taking proactive steps now to ensure the safe management of the whole transport logistics chain in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092063"></A>
Honest drivers and operators have nothing to fear from these new measures and should be reassured that nothing they have to do changes when these laws come into effect. When I say ‘honest drivers and operators’, I mean the vast majority of drivers and truck operators out there today. These new measures are for those operators and drivers who treat the road like a playground, with profit as their only motivation. The ability to take these rogue operators into a room, discuss the risks and dangers of their illegal behaviour and then set or agree to legally binding actions that they must take to ensure compliance and community safety is an important addition to heavy vehicle laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092064"></A>
Honourable members may wonder what the road freight industry itself thinks of these changes. I am advised that its response is clear: it is committed to removing rogue elements that use unsafe practices to reduce costs and undercut honest operators. Any reform that applies penalties that strip rogue elements of any commercial advantage from breaking the law is applauded by those in the industry who are doing the right thing. In this case, doing the right thing means making Queensland’s roads safer and lengthening the life span of valuable state transport infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092065"></A>
In closing, I will comment on the impact that this government’s proactive approach to heavy vehicle safety is having. To do this I draw the House’s attention to the 2009 road crash statistics. I note that there were 57 fatalities as a result of crashes involving heavy freight vehicles within Queensland. This represents 19 fewer fatalities compared to 2008, when the major elements of the government’s reform were introduced. While any road fatality is unacceptable, the 25 per cent reduction in the number of fatalities from crashes involving heavy vehicles is a positive start on the journey to safer roads in Queensland. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (5.49 pm): I rise to speak on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), with particular reference to the new Queensland driver’s licence. This project has been delayed and delayed and delayed under Labor. Even now, if we can believe the transport minister, it will be another five years before the rollout is completed. Initially Labor had a deadline of 2006. Then, in 2008, two years later, the transport minister said the release date would be 2009. Now we have the transport minister saying that we will see the rollout start by the end of the year. Well, we will see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Let me turn to a couple of aspects of this Queensland driver’s licence, particularly the cost to motorists. Last year we saw vehicle registration in Queensland rise by up to 22 per cent. We also saw the dumping of the petrol subsidy of 8.3c per litre, despite Labor promising it would not happen before the election. Labor has given us the most expensive petrol in Australia. We will also see tolls for private cars on the Gateway jump by almost $1 on 1 July, driving up the current price from $2.95 to $3.85. In all, we will see this government rip-off motorists an extra $27 million a year. Now we are seeing a massive increase in the cost of a driver’s licence. A five-year licence will jump from the current $73 to $152.50 by 2014-15. The minister argues that because it is the equal highest in Australia that makes it okay. In February this transport minister told the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 that ‘any suggestion that licence fees will rise by the amounts indicated is without foundation’. The opposition raised concerns about these kinds of increases and at the time she said it was without foundation. Well that was not the case. We will see these massive jumps by 2014-15. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092109"></A>
The minister has claimed that the increased costs are not a profit-making exercise, but she refuses to say how much additional income the government will reap from the increases in the cost of vehicle, boat, taxi and truck licences. She also refuses to guarantee that costs will not increase further than the $152.50 in 2014-15, with her spokesman saying that ‘currently there are no plans to do so’. We should not forget that this is the government that claimed before the election that it had no plans to axe the fuel tax, but after the election it did; that it had no plans to sell off assets, but then it did. Queenslanders know that they cannot trust Labor and they know that they cannot trust this transport minister in terms of increasing the costs for fuel, for rego and for licences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092110"></A>
Let us talk about the cost to taxpayers of this whole project. There was initially talk of this new licence being cost neutral. State government budget figures show that the project was estimated to cost a total of $20 million in 2006-07 and has risen to $84 million in the current budget. Now we are looking at $110 million. What a massive increase--$20 million in 2006-07; now $110 million. It is just another example of waste by this Labor government. Repeatedly we are seeing it bungling and wasting taxpayers’ money. This was supposed to be the smart card but it is becoming increasingly the dumb card. Taxpayers have paid for the state-of-the-art technology--$110 million--but it is not going to be used. That is a sad thing.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can hear Labor members interjecting. They are not concerned about taxpayers’ money at all. They do not mind spending $110 million--increased from the $20 million first projected. They do not care. They just want to keep jacking up the fees. They want to keep jacking up the price of fuel. They want to keep charging motorists more. They want to keep putting up the tolls. That is their solution to every problem in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092113"></A>
Finally, let me turn to the issue of privacy with this card. I want to quote a press release released by the then transport minister on 13 November 2008. The press release quotes the minister as saying at the time--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1092115"></A>
... the motorist’s address will not be shown on this card. Instead it will be stored electronically on the smart chip. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1092116"></A>
“This new future is aimed at personal safety and protection of property,” he said. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1092117"></A>
“Think of it this way--does your ATM card show your address? Your credit card? Your Medicare card? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1092118"></A>
“No--none of these display your home address. From now on, if a person has lost or had their handbag or wallet stolen, the chance of the driver’s licence being used to break into their house is significantly decreased.” </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092119"></A>
That is what the minister said in 2008. Guess what? It turned out not to be the case. The great new smart card--we do not use that term anymore--this driver’s licence will have the address on the back, just like the old cards. Despite what the minister said in 2008 about how wonderful this card was going to be--this $110 million of taxpayers’ money--the card is still going to have the address on the back. Despite the repeated assurances that a motorist’s details would only be encrypted on the new licence card, it will not happen. Given the debacle we have all seen with the rollout of the go card, can Queenslanders have any confidence in this government’s ability to handle private information and the potential misuse of the database involved with this card? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (5.55 pm): I rise tonight to support this bill in part. Obviously we have guarded reservation on some aspects and out and out oppose other parts of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which sets out to amend 25 acts and 12 regulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092125"></A>
I turn my attention first of all to the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994. In the briefing notes it suggests that shipping inspectors can issue directions for a ship to be taken to a safe place. That is presumably if a ship is in distress or experiencing some drama or is in the wrong location. When we use this legislation and overlay it--we can only second guess this because quite often we find that the devil is in the detail and things do not work entirely as proposed or as planned. Using the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 as an example, it has been ordered to move from its location grounded on the Barrier Reef to Hervey Bay. It is being emptied in part up north and in part at Hervey Bay, and then ultimately it will be moved somewhere else. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092128"></A>
It begs the question: what happens if something goes wrong and where does the liability rest? Who is liable? Is it the ship’s owner? Is it the captain? Is it the new inspector, with the authority that he will have to make such directions? Is it the pilots that may be involved or is it the minister? Is it the insurance company that holds the cover over that vessel? Here we have more questions than we have answers, and that seems typical with a lot of legislation that we have. But one thing you can be assured of, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that it will be the people of Queensland who will ultimately pay the price and pick up the tab for incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092129"></A>
Then there is the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995, which imposes fines for the discharging of oil, oil residues, noxious liquids and jettisoning of harmful substances. When you look up the meaning of the words ‘discharging’ or ‘jettisoning’, they mean to get rid of something or someone that is not wanted or needed, to decide not to use an idea or plan or to throw goods or fuel or equipment from a ship or an aircraft to make it lighter. By any measure, neither of those pieces of legislation would have come into play with either the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 or the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
--neither of them were jettisoning, neither of them were discharging; they both encountered troubles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092131"></A>
The circumstances of the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 were that the ship sailed into bad seas, got into strife and lost part of its load. That load in part then damaged the superstructure of the vessel, and therein lies the reason for the oil leak and the contaminants that were in the containers. It would be a safe bet that the ship, the ship’s crew and the owners of the cargo did not want to lose their load and did not want to damage the ship. So the rider that I read in the briefing notes basically says that if a ship is damaged then they are exempt from some of those levels of retribution. Again, this throws up more questions than it answers and does not give us any great confidence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092133"></A>
This legislation has been drafted prior to having all of the information that we need to have qualified legislation. We do not know all of the circumstances around the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
. We know it took a short cut, but we do not know all of the other provisions around it. What interests me in reading the legislation--I hope the minister can address this in summing up the debate and in consideration in detail--is what provisions are contained within the legislation to address ships that are off course or ships that are taking short cuts? It does not reference either of those circumstances in the bill or the briefing notes. That is clearly what happened with the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
. It was taking a short cut. It was taking a route that it was not supposed to be taking. Yet the very legislation that is supposed to address all of those issues does not reference that circumstance. It begs the question: what will happen next time a ship takes a short cut? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096474"></A>
I now move to the Adult Proof of Age Card Act 2008 and the Transport (New Queensland Driver Licensing) Amendment Act 2008 which will be relocated to the Transport Planning and Coordination Act 1994. What we see here, as was highlighted by the previous speaker, the member for Indooroopilly, is the escalation in the price of driver’s licences. It adds to the other costs that we seem to be inflicting on motorists. If it is not costs associated with licences, it is costs associated with registration. If it is not costs associated with registration and licences, it is costs associated with fuel and road tolls. It just seems to be that this government is hell-bent on gouging money out of people any way it can. To use an old American saying: the government is nickel and diming the people of Queensland out of existence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096479"></A>
People are hurting out there. The economy is not real flash. People are struggling to make ends meet. I hear about this every time I go to committee meetings and meetings of sporting bodies. Parents are finding it difficult to get young people on the field and join the footy club because of things like this. People are finding it difficult to find the membership fees for the scout movement and things like that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096481"></A>
Here we have the new licence smart card. It will double the cost of the previous licence. What do people get for it? On the surface I suspect people will get absolutely nothing. They will get a chip in it. It is uncertain why we have a chip in it. What is the identification about? Who can read it? What will it be used for? What information will it contain? Will it contain family history, traffic history, medical information, financial data? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096482"></A>
It seems the government will be the only one to have the readers. The police will not have the readers. Who else would use driver’s licences? Surely the most fundamental users of driver’s licences would be the police. If we are talking about proof of identity through a driver’s licence chip, a smart chip, then surely the police service is the very first entity that needs chip reading devices. We have a government that thinks things up but does not think them through. It seems hell-bent on delivering this super spy card but no-one knows what it is really about. It is just another way of introducing a cost penalty for motorists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096483"></A>
It will be a new cost for young people when we consider the proof of age identity card. Because of the chip it will have exactly the same cost associated with it as a driver’s licence. That card is primarily for young people who choose not to drive a motor car and run the gauntlet of using public transport in Queensland. They will be penalised for doing that. They may as well go out and get a driver’s licence and get a car. Mind you, they will not be able to afford the car. They will not be able to afford the registration or the fuel or the road tolls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096484"></A>
At the end of the day it will be businesses that will be slugged with the extra cost of getting a card reader. If a young person has a proof of age card and they go to a nightclub the nightclub will need a reader to determine whether they are the right person with the right biometric profile, with the right health history, with the right age and identity. Now all of a sudden nightclubs and other places that require proof of age will need a reader. Otherwise this card will be useless and completely redundant. This card is so smart that no-one can read it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096485"></A>
I will move on to the issue of toll roads and how that might impact on residents in my area. The residents I represent are concerned about the increased cost of driver’s licences and all the other costs. They have already indicated to me how tough things are given all of the other costs they face. Now we can have the declaration of a road toll for any road. Theoretically, the government of the day could nominate any road corridor as a toll road. Perhaps it is a strategy for tolling all the roads and then on-selling them. Is this road toll issue the congestion tax that the minister insists we will not have? That is certainly what it will be. These new tolls are another form of tax to penalise motorists. Those in my electorate could be particularly penalised if we roll that strategy out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096487"></A>
Most people in the Redlands have to leave the Redlands every day for employment because this government failed to allow our planned employment precincts to proceed. That would have meant that people could have lived, worked and played locally. That was taken out of the planning scheme for the Redlands. Now people have to drive to Brisbane or other places for employment. This means they are forced into their motor car which means they could be forced to use these new toll roads if they are rolled out right across the south-east corner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096489"></A>
If people in my electorate try to use public transport and do the right thing it is difficult. With no rail duplication into Brisbane the system is flawed. The trains are full. The infrastructure at the train stations is overcrowded. People are flat out getting a parking spot within cooee of the train station at Cleveland, which is at the north of my electorate, after about 6 o’clock in the morning. The trains are full because there is only one line. There is no capacity to use the public transport when it is full. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096490"></A>
We will have no busway out to the Redlands until 2026, maybe. That is a big maybe. The government was doing it by 2016 and then it was pushed out to 2026. For all we know, under this government it could quite easily be pushed out to 2050. If we do not have that bus corridor and if we do not have that significant infrastructure in our area then people are forced back into the motor car. That is the only way they will be able to get to work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096492"></A>
There is no parking at Wienem Creek. There is no TransLink go card facility for the bay islands transport network. Again we are forcing people back into the motor car. That is the only viable option left for most people in the Redlands. This is due to a history of negligence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096493"></A>
This legislation also facilitate the sale of assets. Today, honourable members opposite, those who have been asking the serious and difficult question that we have all heard about--I am sure every electorate has received the spam emails about the courage of the conviction of those opposite--concerning whether we have to sell those assets can put their money where their mouth is. They can actually vote against the provisions of this legislation that facilitate the sale of assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096494"></A>
Forestry Queensland has already gone but the other entities are still on the chopping block. Those opposite can save the rail, the port and the motorway entities. It is not too late. They can vote against those provisions and can save Queensland assets for Queenslanders. I offer support in part, guarded support for other areas and opposition to those areas that have already been articulated by other members. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (6.07 pm): I rise to speak in the debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I have a particular interest in the section of the bill dealing with maritime safety and pollution. The amendments to maritime safety contained in the bill were influenced by the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 incident. The government is still trying to mop up the millions of dollars that it cost taxpayers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096497"></A>
On 11 March 2009 the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
, en route from Newcastle to Indonesia, ran into trouble off the northern tip of Moreton Island. The 180-metre container ship lost 31 containers of ammonium nitrate after it came loose in high seas whipped up by Cyclone Hamish. Some of the containers pierced the ship’s hull, releasing more than 200 tonnes of fuel oil into the ocean. It coated the beaches and headlands on Moreton Island and the Sunshine Coast. Moreton Island, Bribie Island and southern areas of the Sunshine Coast were declared a disaster area on 13 March 2009. Environmentally everything is at risk--fish stocks, turtles, mangroves, sea grasses, the whole lot. It truly was a disaster. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100695"></A>
This incident happened in Queensland waters. This bill falls way short of what is needed to protect our lovely beaches, and a ship can only be detained after the discharge occurs. That is too late. It is the tail wagging the dog. It is the cart before the horse. Why not shut the gate before the horse has bolted? The clean-up of the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
, which is now named the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Mariner</Hansard-Italic>
, involved approximately 2,500 people from more than 22 agencies, including federal, state, local government and port authorities, as well as private contractors. Since then the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef in Commonwealth waters. Where is the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 now? It is in Queensland waters--not just any Queensland waters but a pristine area and a protected marine park sanctuary where humpback whales come to play and mothers bring their calves into the bay before heading back to the Antarctic. It is in my electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100701"></A>
What does this government do? It puts an 80,000 tonne damaged ship in the middle of this sanctuary. The primary agency for the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 remains the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, not Maritime Safety Queensland. However, Maritime Safety Queensland has an ancillary role in the unloading and monitoring of that ship. I want to thank Patrick Quirk, a Maritime Safety Queensland officer, for keeping the community informed. He has been fantastic in informing the community of Hervey Bay as to what has been happening. My office was also kindly contacted by the transport minister, who told me that the federal Maritime Safety Authority had made the decision to bring the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 into Hervey Bay’s sheltered waters. I thank the minister for that contact.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100706"></A>
I was wondering why I could not get my hands on a risk assessment and a contingency plan prior to the decision being made to take that ship there. Surely there was one. Surely there must have been a risk assessment on the already compromised ship coming into such a beautiful area. I have received nothing to date, but I did find out that the five tow ropes broke when they were trying to navigate the ship back into the Gladstone port and it was considered to be extremely dangerous to tug operators, not the fact that Gladstone could not afford a ship to sink to the bottom of the Gladstone port and what impacts that might have on the coal industry in Queensland! Instead, they decided to tow the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 from Gladstone to Hervey Bay and I believe that they did not even break one tow rope.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100709"></A>
What if something untoward happened to the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
? Since my request for the risk assessment that helped them make the decision, the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 took another week to come to Hervey Bay. I also attended a meeting with Maritime Safety Queensland where it allowed open dialogue with concerned groups about processes and unloading of about one-third of the cargo. It was about how it thought things were going to go, and I certainly pray that it is right. Following the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 incident, two damning reports have been handed down. The government has not properly responded to these reports. The <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 is being unloaded now. Two days ago it changed its original anchorage to calmer waters again. We are toying with disaster and the government needs to have transparency in the process for all Queenslanders and to send a loud message to international shipping companies that Queensland is not up for environmental ruin just for the coal trade.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100714"></A>
With such a compromised ship in our waters, we live in fear of something bad happening. This has put the waters around Fraser Island and Hervey Bay at risk of major environmental incidents. There is concern from residents, the commercial fishing industry and our tourism industry in Hervey Bay. World Heritage listed Fraser Island is not unlike the Great Barrier Reef. It is World Heritage as well, and I can give members correspondence from other environmental groups along the eastern seaboard of Queensland that did not want this ship parked alongside them. With our mining exports increasing and therefore the number of ships coming into Queensland ports multiplying, it is critical that Queensland gets the management of our coastal waters right.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100717"></A>
We need increased penalties that can be levied for the discharge of oil, toxic liquids and other substances such as containerised cargoes. The current penalty is $350,000 for an individual and $1.75 million for a corporate body. These penalties will now increase to $500,000 for an individual and $10 million for a body corporate. I have always believed in prevention rather than cure. As I said earlier, currently we can only detain a ship after the discharge has occurred. The maritime safety amendments contained in this bill do nothing with regard to preventing disasters. Rather, they cover the process of what we can do after it happens. My only hope is that the government does not take its eye off the potential disaster faced by the Fraser Coast and the World Heritage listed Fraser Island.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100719"></A>
I believe that in today’s world we should be able to track these ships. We can track aircraft coming into an airport. We can even track trawlers going out to fishing grounds. Surely we can track these 230-metre ships going through areas where they should not be and we should be penalising them if they do not follow our directions, not wait until the ship runs aground. We are talking about 230-metre long ships. They are huge ships. It is incredible that this size ship can run aground somewhere where it should not be. However, Maritime Safety Queensland and the VMR in my area are underfunded. They save lives, and the VMR needs to be looked at in terms of funding. It is very underfunded at this point in time and its infrastructure is deteriorating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100721"></A>
I turn now to the issue of asset sales. The Liberal National Party opposes the asset sales contained in this bill, especially regarding the Port of Brisbane Corporation, Queensland Rail and the tollways. Is Queensland going to end up with tollways similar to the Japanese system where you get on the road and you pay when you get off depending on how far you have travelled? Is that what will happen here? Queensland Rail will be restructured. This restructure will entail the establishment of two identities and the government is flogging off the most profitable part of that company. It is also selling off the building of trains as well. There is EDI Rail in Maryborough which builds many trains for Queensland, yet now the Queensland government has gone out internationally and asked for expressions of interest from other companies to build trains. Why is the government doing this when we have so many good people who can build those trains here? If we lose this industry, Queensland is going to lose that expertise.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109128"></A>
I really cannot understand why the government wants to send train-building contracts overseas. This is an industry which creates around about 800 jobs, and those workers are very insecure at this point in time. The families in my electorate who work in Maryborough have no security. If that local company does not get those contracts, we will lose the expertise of that industry in Queensland. We will see that industry go overseas. We will then have to buy all of our trains from overseas companies. Why are we giving away the technology and the expertise of our country to other countries? I just cannot understand that side of it. Finally, there are parts of the bill that are commendable, but there are other parts of the bill that we will reject. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (6.19 pm): Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak to this very important bill, which amends 25 acts and 15 regulations and which runs for approximately 260 pages. Can I say very simply and very precisely that I have always opposed the assets sale. Accordingly, I will be voting against the bill because contained within the amendments to those 25 acts there is a proposal that will facilitate a future assets sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104937"></A>
I see merit in the bill. I support significant amendments to other acts that have been placed in this omnibus bill by the minister. But because I have publicly made my position on the assets sale clear and because the government has chosen to include in this bill the first step to facilitate a future assets sale, I will be voting against the bill. Accordingly, I see no advantage in speaking to the other amendments in this bill and why I support them. So I will be voting against the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104939"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (6.20 pm): I rise to speak in support of the bill and, in particular, to talk about the amendments the bill makes to the Transport Infrastructure Act, which will support the delivery of stage 1 of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project--a project that is set to transform public transport on the Gold Coast. I was disappointed to hear the member for Gaven not support the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project, but can I assure members of the House that the residents of the Albert electorate in particular are looking forward to the rolling out of stage 1. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104942"></A>
Stage 1 of the project will connect Griffith University and the new Gold Coast Hospital at Southport with Broadbeach via the Southport CBD and Surfers Paradise. For the Albert electorate, that means more jobs. It is also better for the environment as it will reduce road congestion. It is good news for residents and particularly good news for our tourists. The proposed amendments will provide a robust platform for participation by the Queensland government, the private project proponents and their financiers as the PPP for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of stage 1 of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104943"></A>
It is no secret that Queensland is experiencing sustained population growth. I only have to look out the window of my electorate office to know that. The Albert electorate in particular is enduring the growing pains associated with the population growth in South-East Queensland. That is why I am very pleased that the Queensland government, through this minister, is investing more than ever in rail lines, trains and carriages to carry more passengers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104944"></A>
As well, the residents of the Albert electorate are particularly looking forward to the opening of the new Coomera interchange. There has been an allocation of $11 million in joint state and federal funding to continue the concept planning and implementation of the Coomera interchange on the westbound side. I would particularly like to thank not only Main Roads but also the residents for their patience. But of course, for the northern part of the electorate it is the Beaudesert-Beenleigh Road upgrade that we are all looking forward to and for which people are eagerly signing petitions. </Hansard-Body>

This bill is good news for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project, which is a $464 million funding commitment by the Queensland government with support from the Australian government and the Gold Coast City Council. My vision is to see further linkages from stage 1 to Upper Coomera and the important Coomera Town Centre. By delivering the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project as a public-private partnership, the government is able to provide better value for money for Queenslanders. By working with private sector experts from across the world, the government is able to deliver complex transport infrastructure projects in the most innovative, timely and cost-effective manner. I congratulate the minister and commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (6.24 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. Transport is vital to keeping our communities moving. This bill acknowledges the growth issues that we have been experiencing in the south-east and the corresponding need for transport infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104951"></A>
This bill addresses some of the infrastructure needs of the Gold Coast. The Bligh government is making the bold move to ensure that Queensland has the infrastructure that we need to continue to develop a modern and efficient transport system. We are also ensuring that our roads are safer than ever by ensuring that truck drivers have reasonable working conditions and that they know they can do their job safely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104952"></A>
Owing to the continuing increase in the number of heavy vehicles on our roads and a corresponding increase in accidents involving heavy vehicles, it was time to review the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995. The reforms to heavy vehicle use were designed to achieve national conformity of and compliance with heavy vehicle operating requirements. These reforms include the adoption of additional enforcement measures: two administrative and two court based sanctions.</Hansard-Body>

The new smart licence is a step forward, ensuring greater security for holders as their personal details such as their address are not as easily available for misuse if their licence is stolen or used at nightclubs. Most importantly for my electorate of Redcliffe and for our fragile coastal environment--the Great Barrier Reef and our much loved local and tourist beaches--this bill includes further amendments to our maritime safety and maritime pollution legislation. The <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 incident, which occurred in my electorate last year, and the incident involving the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 east of Great Keppel Island demonstrate the importance of our marine safety and marine pollution legislation. This bill amends the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994 so that if a ship enters our waters with non-compliant safety equipment, shipping inspectors will be able to direct the master of that ship to return to port or to the safety of waters for which the ship’s equipment is compliant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104959"></A>
The amendments to the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995 will increase the penalties for the discharge of oil into Queensland’s coastal waters from a maximum of $350,000 to a maximum of $500,000 for an individual. The penalty for a body corporate will increase from $1,750,000 to $10 million. These amendments are important as they put shipping companies on notice that if they do not do the right thing by Queensland’s environment there will be strong penalties that will make a large hole in their business profits, and this will encourage masters to ensure their vessels are in good order before they enter our waters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104960"></A>
Queenslanders value their environment as it is the basis of their unique lifestyle--I know that this lifestyle is why many people come to live in Redcliffe--and they expect the state government to look after their interests. I commend the minister for moving to protect our valuable natural environment and for recognising the importance of transport in keeping our community moving while we are experiencing this huge growth. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.30 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to the debate on the government’s Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I note that the government’s bill amends 25 acts and 12 regulations and for the sake of time tonight I do not intend to list all of them as others have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109360"></A>
I wish to commend the shadow minister for transport and main roads, Fiona Simpson, for her contribution to the debate and for her work in holding the government accountable on transport and main roads issues. My contribution to the debate will not be exhaustive, as many aspects of the bill have been covered. I commend the shadow minister’s speech as a more detailed treatise of the government’s bill than my brief contribution. I join with the other opposition members to support the overall intent of the bill. However, I oppose several aspects of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109361"></A>
As I have said on previous occasions, such transport bills need to be considered in the light of the government’s failure to manage the state’s transport system, particularly in the bayside region of Brisbane. In my electorate of Cleveland there are many very significant transport needs, particularly in the areas of transport infrastructure and service delivery, that have not been addressed by subsequent Labor state and federal governments. The government continues to fail to provide a reliable rail service between Cleveland and the city. Commuters at peak times are crammed into carriages like sardines. Just yesterday a constituent contacted me on the way home from the city on the Cleveland train and told me the train was unbearably packed and that he felt like a sardine jammed in a can. Commuters from the Redlands are in great need of additional peak services to cope with the current situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109362"></A>
Further investment in carparking at Wellington Point and Cleveland stations is desperately needed. While the government has recently announced the long needed upgrade at Ormiston station, at the same time the government’s election promise of 50 additional parking bays at Birkdale station has still not taken place. In fact, the government is actively planning to break that promise as it only plans to provide about 28 extra parking spaces to the current number. I call on the transport minister to honour the election promise which in itself was a much smaller commitment than what was required.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109363"></A>
Breakdowns on the Cleveland line are also common and disrupt commuters travelling to work, school and various other activities such as shopping. We badly need immediate solutions from this government. I call on the minister to take decisive action now and to not wait until things are even more out of control than they already are for Cleveland and the Redlands. Sooner rather than later the Redlands needs duplication of the Manly-Cleveland line to create greater capacity on that line. Then there is stage 3 of the Eastern Busway that needs to be brought forward earlier than 2026 so that it will be of value to Redlanders sooner rather than later. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109364"></A>
In regard to maritime safety and pollution aspects of the bill, Queensland needs a more effective approach to prevention of marine pollution and a more effective response to maritime disasters than this government has shown. As I have previously stated, the independent review of the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 oil spill at Moreton Island revealed that Maritime Safety Queensland was not properly prepared or resourced for such an oil spill resulting in the failure in the response, particularly regarding the response coordination and communication lines. No matter how the government tries to spin it, the government failed to protect Moreton Island, the bay and the marine life of the bay during the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 disaster. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109365"></A>
As I also previously mentioned in the House, the condemnation of the government contained in the review was amplified by the local North Stradbroke Island residents who were among the first to respond to the disaster. Their firsthand accounts were of government incompetence and complacency. Many residents offered their help but were told the government had it all under control when clearly it did not. Only last week I was with the Quandamooka rangers on North Stradbroke Island while they were receiving their certificates for work in land and vegetation management and I was advised that they were still, even at that point in time and in the next few weeks, working on the clean up on Moreton Island arising from the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 spill. This incident and the government’s slow response remains a source of anger among locals who do not trust the Bligh government to protect their island. I remain very concerned as the local MP for North Stradbroke Island that the island, its residents, its natural beauty and economy could be once again threatened due to the failure of this government to provide sufficient protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109366"></A>
Pollution in Moreton Bay from various sources remains a problem. Recent water quality tests reveal that water pollution levels are unacceptably high in some parts of the bay. The impact of pollution on marine life is understated by this government as it prefers to blame everything on mum and dad recreational fishers. The government needs to improve its handling of maritime disasters and to reduce marine pollution. The government has not properly responded to these maritime incidents--and we need only look at the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 situation--and is putting the waters surrounding Queensland at risk of further major environmental incidents. As our mining exports increase and therefore the number of ships multiply, it is critical that Queensland gets the management of our coastal waters right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109367"></A>
In relation to asset sales, in particular the Port of Brisbane, the LNP has consistently opposed this Labor government’s privatisation plans. In the context of this transport bill, we oppose the plan and we continue to oppose the plan to sell off Queensland Rail, Port of Brisbane and Queensland Motorways. We do not support the aspects of this bill that allow for the preparation of these assets for sale. Labor MPs opposite have the opportunity to vote against these provisions and join with the LNP to support those ideals they supposedly hold to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109368"></A>
The government’s preparation of the Port of Brisbane assets for sale has caused significant concern amongst some in the boating community. For example, at Manly Harbour boating and sailing clubs are being hit hard with dramatic increases in costs for their land and seabed leases and for dredging services. The dramatic cost rises they have been forced to pay by this government are causing undue financial pressure and hardship and may send some of them broke. Those boating clubs that do survive will only be able to do so by passing on these dramatic cost increases to their members and clients. I appeal to the government to consider each boating and yachting club on a case-by-case basis instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach that will send the smaller clubs broke. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109369"></A>
In relation to driver’s licences, the 108 per cent increase in the cost of the new driver’s licence is deplorable. The government’s new licence could well be called the ‘half-smart card’ for its failure to implement it properly, on time and on budget. Under this Labor government Queenslanders are literally being taxed off the roads. It already costs Queensland motorists more than drivers in other states for the right to drive. We pay dearly under this government in the form of higher than normal vehicle registrations, fuel taxes and now driver’s licences. We have seen this project blow out from a $20 million project to figures as high as $100 million and $110 million, a cost to be borne by Queensland motorists. This is yet another cash grab by an economically incompetent government that has to find new ways to tax Queenslanders to satisfy its addiction to spending. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109370"></A>
Further, the government has been unable to answer the reasonable privacy and access concerns of the public and opposition. Again I commend the shadow minister for transport and main roads for her good work and encourage the government to consider the opposition’s amendments to improve this bill for the benefit of the people of Cleveland and all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (7.39 pm): I rise to contribute to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 on behalf of the Kawana electorate. From the outset I convey my support for some aspects of this bill but I do have some reservations that I will outline in further detail. The bill before the House amends 25 various acts and 12 regulations. Obviously common sense prevails and I am not going to list the 25 bills and the 12 regulations. I would like to initially address the provisions of the bill that deal with maritime safety and pollution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113580"></A>
On 11 March 2009 we saw an oil spill occur off the South-East Queensland coast that devastated the beaches of the Sunshine Coast through Moreton Bay and down to the Gold Coast, including the pristine beaches and probably some of the best beaches in Queensland--in the Kawana electorate. As part of the disaster management response to that situation, the state government was slow to react and in the end panicked and threw money at the problem, hoping it would go away in a hurry. It should also be noted that this disaster occurred in the midst of a state election campaign. The feedback that I received indicates that the clean-up efforts were costing up to $100,000 per day. Money was thrown at the project in an effort to do whatever was necessary without a well thought out plan in place to respond to the disaster appropriately. I know that my local surf club lost a week of trade as a result of the oil spill clean-up because it was commandeered for the clean-up operations headquarters. I have to say that I am disappointed that it has taken over a year for the government to introduce steps that strengthen the protection of Queensland waters, our maritime environment and one of the key components of what makes Queensland so special--that is, our coastline. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113581"></A>
I support the measures in this bill that increase the current penalties that can be levied for the discharge of oil, noxious liquids and harmful substances such as the containerised cargo. This penalty will bring Queensland into line with New South Wales in having one of the toughest penalties in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113582"></A>
The government’s delay in responding to the oil spill of March 2009 clearly indicates that it has scant regard for protecting Queensland’s environment and it failed to learn the lessons from the state election in March last year. The provisions in this bill strengthen the government’s capabilities to respond to further disasters should they occur and also strengthen regulatory provisions in preventing any disasters from occurring in the first instance through the change in classification of maritime pilots. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113583"></A>
While the introduction of this provision of the bill is welcome, the government’s continuing attitude to marine safety and pollution is under question. In the last month we have seen the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 towed from its anchoring on the Barrier Reef to another environmentally sensitive area of the Queensland coastline--Hervey Bay--in an effort to perform the delicate task of unloading tonnes of coal from the bulk carrier’s hull. This morning we heard the transport minister say that it was the federal government that told the state government to tow the ship to Hervey Bay. Would you not think that the state government would stand up to the federal government bullies and say, ‘No, you are not dragging it from one environmentally sensitive area of Queensland to another’? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113586"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the transport minister. Is the honourable minister implying that the opposition has the power to direct Maritime Safety Queensland to tow large vessels? Is that what the honourable minister is suggesting? If she is, that is completely off the subject of what we are discussing. We are discussing the fact that today in question time the transport minister stood in this place and said, ‘Don’t blame me. Blame the federal government because the federal government told us to tow it to Hervey Bay.’ Again we see the state government say, ‘Yes, Uncle Kev. We’ll do whatever you want.’ However, it should not be when it is to the detriment of the environmentally sensitive areas of Hervey Bay, as was clearly outlined by the honourable member for Hervey Bay earlier this evening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113588"></A>
Quite often it is the case that those opposite say one thing and do another. This is just another example of the double standards that this government has as its mantra. The provision of this bill that deals with tollways and extends the categories of lands that the minister is able to determine as a toll road should concern all Queensland motorists. Under this provision, and coupled with the sale of Queensland Motorways, the Minister for Transport can recategorise a road to be included as a toll road for the purposes of an asset that will no longer be owned and controlled by the Queensland government. Obviously this provision has been initiated to sweeten the deal with Queensland Motorways and up the price for this money-making asset as it goes to market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113590"></A>
Under this government and its financial incompetence and mismanagement of the state’s coffers on the back of a mining boom, the cost of living expenses for Queenslanders are continuing to skyrocket out of control. We have seen--and other members have indicated tonight--that electricity prices continue to soar, registration costs have risen, licensing costs are set to rise by 109 per cent, rates continue to skyrocket out of control following the forced amalgamations of councils and water costs continue to blow out. The list goes on and on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113591"></A>
The socialist mistruth that higher taxes leads to better services has been exposed. If we were to view the Queensland government on the popular show <Hansard-Italic>
MythBusters</Hansard-Italic>
, we would certainly see some myths disproved. I reckon the <Hansard-Italic>
MythBusters</Hansard-Italic>
 series would have probably 12 months of myths to portray on a week-by-week basis. We only have to look at a few. Government members say that they are better placed to support working families. I thought they would have agreed to that. No, I will take their silence as if they said they do not support working families. Of course, when we hear them say, ‘We support working families,’ on the <Hansard-Italic>
MythBusters</Hansard-Italic>
 show, that would have a ‘myth’ stamp right across it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113595"></A>
They also talk about jobs. Where are the jobs, I ask members opposite? Jobs are supposed to be in their DNA. Are they not in their DNA? The government says that jobs are in their DNA. Based on their performance, on the <Hansard-Italic>
MythBusters</Hansard-Italic>
 program that claim would have another stamp across it and it would not be ‘truth’; it would be ‘myth’. It is a myth that jobs are in Labor’s DNA. Then, of course, how could we forget the statement, ‘Queensland, you can count on me.’ </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1113598"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the honourable minister that Queensland can count on this government. I take that interjection to mean that the minister agrees that Queenslanders can count on it for higher licensing costs, higher registration costs, higher water costs, higher taxes and higher fuel prices. Yes, Queensland can count on this government for higher taxes, lower living standards and more taxes than they have ever paid before. Again, if we saw it on <Hansard-Italic>
MythBusters</Hansard-Italic>
 the great statement ‘Queensland, you can count on me’ would have ‘myth’ stamped right across it--not ‘truth but ‘myth’ because we know that under this government fuel has gone up, rego has gone up, water has gone up and electricity has gone up. The list goes on and on. Who does this impact more? It impacts working families, the very people for whom this government stand up every day and attack the opposition for not looking after. These are the very people who government members claim are their support base and the people to whom they say, ‘We’re looking after you.’ I am sorry, but all these things--higher fuel, registration and licensing costs--impact more on working families in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113600"></A>
Under this provision in the bill motorists will see new toll roads in Queensland at the whim of a minister who said that Queensland Rail was not for sale a fortnight before the coal and freight haulage asset was put under the hammer in last year’s budget. We have seen this argument before. The government promised that electricity prices would not rise after the distribution grid was privatised yet they still ballooned out of control. What commitment does the government have to Queensland motorists that, when Queensland Motorways is sold off in the fire sale of assets, toll prices will not balloon out of control in the way electricity prices have? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113601"></A>
The bill also caters for the restructuring of Queensland Rail’s coal and freight division and the Port of Brisbane as part of the fire sale of assets regime, which the LNP will continue to oppose. Can I say how interesting it is to read the minister’s second reading speech. One has only to refer to the fifth paragraph on the first page to see that the minister herself said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1113603"></A>
Third, the bill will amend legislation to create a robust port planning regime for the future, maintain Queensland Rail as a passenger focused government owned corporation and establish QR National as a proud, Queensland based company. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118034"></A>
It is a slap in the face for Queenslanders when the Minister for Transport talks about proud Queensland based companies, when two or three pages later they are talking about selling the assets in the same department. It is a slap in the face for Queenslanders. It is a shame that the minister does not hold that same view about proud Queensland owned assets with respect to other money-making assets contained in her own department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118037"></A>
Queenslanders are already paying enough levies and taxes for the construction of transport infrastructure in this state. This is a third levy that motorists will have to pay for the use of Queensland roads as a result of PPP arrangements with the private sector that will always be ongoing. This illustrates the difference between Labor and conservative governments. Conservative governments always look at reducing taxes and levies when it is fiscally responsible to do so, and the Labor Party is in the business of increasing expenditure, racking up public debt and putting continual pressure on inflation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118038"></A>
The second provision in this bill that I wish to raise a reservation about relates to the compensation for land resumed for transport purposes. It is always hard to deal with property resumptions. I am of the view that the government should resume property only as a last resort. However, if resumptions are essential to a particular project, those having their properties resumed should be fairly compensated and dealt with in an appropriate manner. Circumstances in the CoastConnect transport project, linking Caloundra to Maroochydore through my electorate, have seen residents and business owners treated with absolute contempt. While the project has never received final approval by the department, property resumptions have been undertaken to widen the Nicklin Way for bus and cycle lanes. Clearly, the government has not learnt the lessons--any lessons--from the Traveston Dam waste and debacle of last year. The government’s arrogance exudes on a daily basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118041"></A>
The provisions in the bill that relate to the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project clearly indicate that the Gold Coast is the golden child of this government, with consequences for the Sunshine Coast. While I understand that the growth of the south-east region requires infrastructure management and attention, the Gold Coast is always at the top of the list. Whether it is for a hospital or, in this case, a rapid transit project, the Gold Coast is at the top of the tree. While I support the rapid transit project on the Gold Coast as a means of improving transport infrastructure in the region, the Sunshine Coast has been neglected by the government for too long. ‘CAMCOS’ has become a dirty word as, for over a decade, Sunshine Coast residents have had the term thrown in their faces by Labor governments as a transport initiative for the region. The good people of the Gold Coast should not miss out on infrastructure, but priority should be given to the entire south-east region, and not just to areas south of the Pine River bridge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118042"></A>
The provision in the bill that deals with the new Queensland driver’s licence is a dangerous step in the direction of impinging on the civil liberties of Queenslanders. As members in this chamber would know, I am a strong supporter of civil liberties when they are being trampled on by governments. While I embrace modern technology, with the collection and storage of such personal information as security pin codes and next of kin information, emphasis needs to be placed on who will have access to that information. The importance placed on the collection and storage of this data should not be understated. As these technologies are continually embraced, society has seen an escalation in crimes such as identity theft and other similar fraudulent occurrences. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE: </Hansard-Member-Up>
I take the interjection. As technology has grown so has credit card fraud, as it becomes easier for people to skim details off credit cards and electronic devices. As I said, unfortunately the escalation in these crimes is occurring on a more frequent basis in Australia. Any government storage of personal information needs to maintain the highest level of security. That goes without saying, but it needs to be continually stressed. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1118045"></A>
Other reforms in this legislation are welcome transport initiatives for the state. Heavy vehicle road safety has been addressed and balanced so that motorists’ protection is balanced with operator breaches followed through by the department. Provision is also made for the repair of road and rail infrastructure damaged by heavy vehicles to be at the cost of the operator, and not the taxpayer. Other regulations in the bill that reduce time delays on transport and bureaucracy are certainly welcome. I commend the bill to the House, with the reservations that I have stated. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (7.54 pm): During the debate on this bill I have listened to comments from the opposition in relation to toll provisions. Tonight I rise to set the record straight. The toll provisions in this bill expand the categories of state land that can be declared state toll road corridor land. This will facilitate the sale of Queensland Motorways by allowing the existing Gateway and Logan motorways land to be declared state toll road corridor land. The amendments proposed by the bill are largely technical and will streamline the administrative processes required to allow motorway land to be offered in a single lease. The existing Gateway and Logan motorways land to be declared is already owned by the state. The proposed declaration of state toll road corridor land will not affect private land. The bill extends the existing categories of land that may be declared state toll road corridor land to non-freehold land on or within which road or rail transport infrastructure is situated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118048"></A>
The powers to declare tolls are set out in section 93 of the act. Those provisions, which have been in force since January 2006, are not--I repeat, not--being amended by this bill. Section 93 allows the Minister for Main Roads to declare that a toll may be payable for use of a state controlled road, a franchised road, a road to be constructed under a road franchise agreement or state toll road corridor land. The powers to declare tolls extend beyond state toll road corridor land, which is subject to the changes proposed by the bill. The government has not used the existing powers that have been available since 2006 to introduce tolls across Queensland in the manner suggested by the opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118049"></A>
It is interesting that in this place there is only one party that plans congestion charges for motorists and it is the party sitting opposite. It is right here in the integrated regional transport plan signed off by the member for Gregory when he was the transport and main roads minister in their last term in government. That is right: the party opposite plans congestion charges for motorists. Time and time again in this House the Premier has made it clear that the Bligh government will not introduce road pricing for motorists. Unfortunately, the opposition has embarked upon a scare campaign with the member for Maroochydore, the ‘Chicken Little’ of Queensland politics, leading the charge. They should apologise to the millions of Queensland motorists who use South-East Queensland’s road network every year for causing them unnecessary concern and worry. </Hansard-Body>

As everyone knows, on Sunday 200,000 Queenslanders voted with their feet at the opening of the new Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge, which is our $1.88 billion investment to tackle congestion on one of the state’s busiest motorways. The opposition has an opinion on everything and a solution for nothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118052"></A>
Let us talk about plans, which, sadly, are things that those opposite lack. Let us talk about what we have done, what we are planning to do and what we are building. This year we have a $7.1 billion capital works program for Transport and Main Roads. That is a record amount, proudly funded by the Bligh government. Main Roads projects will deliver 30,000 jobs. We built Australia’s largest road and bridge project. The $1.88 billion Gateway Upgrade Project that I mentioned earlier is getting bigger with a half billion dollar expansion. All up, that project will cost $2.5 billion. There is $315 million for the Houghton Highway duplication, $910 million for the Pacific Motorway upgrade and $2.5 billion worth of work on the Ipswich Motorway. Those are three big projects that mean thousands of jobs. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Bundamba. She campaigned for years to get the money. It took the election of the Rudd Labor government to get the funding for that project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122435"></A>

Mr Horan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You know the money was paid before the election--well before. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Toowoomba South sat in this place moot for a decade while the motorists of Queensland suffered and now he has the temerity to pipe up. For a decade he sat there doing nothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122438"></A>
There is the $198 million Bruce Highway upgrade from Uhlmann Road to Caboolture, which was completed last year, and the $166 million for the Hope Island Road upgrade on the Gold Coast. Not only that: we are looking after the needs of motorists right across Queensland and throughout regional Queensland. We spent $615 million on the Cooroy-Curra upgrade, which generated 1,700 jobs, and $100 million on the Bundaberg Ring Road. Work on the Forgan Bridge in Mackay, which I spoke so proudly about this morning, generated more than 430 jobs. The Townsville Port Access Road, serving that growing port of the north, the Townsville port, generated more than 1,030 jobs. The Douglas Arterial Road--the duplication of that busy road in Townsville--generated 448 jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122445"></A>
We are building more than jobs; we are building a stronger Queensland--$3.53 billion this year. That means more than 30,000 jobs at a time when jobs and job security are more important than ever before. What do we have? We have a moribund opposition, lacking policies, coming into this chamber trying to scare the motorists of Queensland. We have a vast road network here in Queensland--about the same distance from here to London and back. The Bligh government is hard at work delivering a first-class road network for all Queenslanders and, while we are doing that, we are delivering jobs and job security for roadworkers. You can bet London to a brick on that one, Mr Deputy Speaker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122446"></A>
Let us look at the opposition--the moribund bunch opposite. They have not built a road in Queensland for donkey’s years. Let me remind the House of their plans for roads at the last election. They wanted to slash jobs for roadworkers. They wanted to slash jobs on our roads--shameful. If they got their way, they would be ripping up the bitumen--just like they ripped up the railway line to the Gold Coast and the Greenvale line up north. They would rip up the bitumen, just like they ripped up the railway lines. They have no respect for infrastructure in this state. I will say it again: we only support policies that protect Queensland’s interests, and that is what this bill will achieve. The Bligh government has categorically ruled out congestion charging and distance based tolling. The same cannot be said for those members opposite. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (8.02 pm): I rise to speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 with regard to light rail. I was quite taken by the claims that we are going to take 75,000 cars each day off Gold Coast roads by 2016, as stated by the member for Burleigh here earlier today. I would like to see that. How is a 13-kilometre stretch of light rail going to take 75,000 cars off Gold Coast roads? How is that measured? Where are the people coming from and where are they going to, for goodness sake? Where are the 75,000 cars going to be parked, or are the people going to walk to the area to use the light rail? Maybe all of those things are possible. But where do the figures come from? That is what I would like to know. I would like to hear an explanation from the minister, if she could possibly dig all of those figures out for me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122453"></A>
I did a little bit of research. First of all, I went to the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
. I read in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 that the light rail project is ‘expected to take about 75,000 cars off the coastal strip by 2016’. That sounds similar to the figure that was mentioned here earlier tonight. I then went to the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
, which says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1122456"></A>
“These major tenders confirm the project will be delivered and we will build a transport network that will take 75,000 cars off Gold Coast roads when it is completed in 2014,” </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122457"></A>
So we have 2016 on the one hand and 2014 on the other hand. That was a direct quote of the Premier in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 of 13 May 2010. Then we have the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 again stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1122459"></A>
The project, which is expected to take about 75,000 cars off the coastal strip by 2016, is due for completion in 2014.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122460"></A>
That is all wonderful, but where do the figures come from? Where do these quotes come from? So I go to the Gold Coast Rapid Transit Concept Design Impact Management Plan and do a search for ‘75,000’ to see how many times that might come up. The ‘Background’ chapter states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1122463"></A>
For the Gold Coast, the aim is to increase the mode share to 6.5 percent by 2011--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1122464"></A>
so this cannot possibly be anything to do with this 2016 figure we have been hearing, but let me read on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1122465"></A>
which would require patronage of 130,000 trips per day, compared with the present 75,000 trips per day. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1122466"></A>
No, that is not the 75,000 that we are looking for. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122467"></A>
Let us dig a little bit deeper. We go along and find a figure of 75,000 mentioned in one of the tables. Table 8-38 refers to Surfers Paradise and mentions a 75,000 figure in the detail, but that 75,000 figure relates to 2026. So obviously that is not where we are expecting to get these accurate figures from. So we go along and we find table 8-55. There is that 75,000 figure again but the year is 2026. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122470"></A>
Let us go back to 2016 in table 8-55, ‘Private vehicle trips to/from key Gold Coast activity centres with and without the GCRT system’. This must be the source. Let us have a look at these figures. Without the GCRT, for Southport, Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach and Griffith Knowledge Precinct we have 116,000, 66,000, 131,000 and 37,000 respectively. With the GCRT, the figures are 105,000, 59,000, 124,000 and 33,000 respectively. By simply subtracting those figures, we do not come up with the 75,000 figure that has been touted all over the news. What we come up with is 29,000 for 2016. But everything that we read in the news, as quoted by the Premier, talks about 75,000 vehicles off the road on the Gold Coast strip in 2016. It is an absolute load of rubbish. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122472"></A>
So we go a little bit further to see whether there is something else in this document. Here we have table 8-56. Guess what? Table 8-56 confirms the table above it. It lists the ‘Change in daily PV trips’, private vehicle trips, as a percentage change and numerical--for Southport, minus 10,850; for Surfers Paradise, minus 7,150; for Broadbeach, minus 6,700; and for the Griffith Knowledge Precinct, minus 4,200. The total is 28,900 fewer trips--near enough to 29,000 for 2016, the year that all the articles quoted as the year in which there would be 75,000 vehicles off the roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122474"></A>
Let us go back to 2026 and where we originally saw that 75,000 figure. Let us have a look at those numbers. Let us add those figures up and see whether they come to 75,000. It is nothing like it. It is something in the order of 35,000 trips. So somewhere between 2026, I would suggest, and 2200 we might have 75,000 vehicles coming off the road on the Gold Coast strip but certainly not 75,000 by 2016 as recorded in the media as direct quotes from the Premier of this state. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, not media research. I thank the member for Brisbane Central for that interjection. I went to where the 75,000 was quoted. It was quoted directly from the lips of this Premier in local newspapers. But there is absolutely nothing in the data that supports those figures. So they are just an absolute concoction. I have to tell you that I will be pleased--</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Wendt): Order! Member for Coomera, please address your comments through the chair and do not use that other word. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122479"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would be very pleased to say I am wrong. I would be very pleased if someone could produce this 75,000 figure by the 2016 date from somewhere in the detail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127052"></A>
Now let us talk about the transport infrastructure that is being ignored on the Gold Coast. I have spoken many times in this House about the Gold Coast rail line. The bottom line is that we have no solution until 2017 according to this government and this minister. This minister admits that the Gold Coast line is the most overcrowded line on the network. Yet there will be no solution for a minimum of seven years. We have been talking about putting tunnels under the Brisbane River. That is assuming that all the ducks line up. That is assuming that we get all of the money--the $8.4 billion--to do the job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127055"></A>
I point out to the minister that the reality is that the Gold Coast line is already the most overcrowded line on the network. We cannot wait seven years. We need to start thinking outside the box. We need to stop going around in circles. We need to find some solutions for the Gold Coast rail line to resolve this problem. We are talking about the fastest growing urban area in this country. We need to resolve this problem. Acknowledging it is a problem and doing nothing about it is just not on and not good enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127056"></A>
Having buses that run on time is another good one. Let us get the system working as it should be working. Instead of telling people that we have not got the budget to review the bus system in the northern Gold Coast area let us get it working. Let us not have it that people in Hope Island who want to catch the bus to get to the station to get down to Robina or up to Brisbane have to take a two-hour bus trip just to get to the train station. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127057"></A>
We need buses that go to areas that people live in. That is another good one. What about Boykambil? Where is Boykambil? It is right in the middle of the sticks, one would think. No, absolutely not. It is right in the middle of the fastest growing region in this country and yet people have to walk a minimum of five kilometres to get to a bus stop. So why do we not do something about getting a bus down Sickle Avenue to pick up elderly people, young people who want to use the public transport network as has been touted as the way that we want people to go. Let us get them to the railway station a little bit quicker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127061"></A>
Let us look at Fryar Road, Eagleby, which is at the other end of my electorate and where we have an expanding elderly population as a result of a retirement village development and so forth in the area. We have 500 metre-long hills that people have to traverse. I am talking about people from the retirement village who are in the age range 67 to 80 years. They have to walk up these hills to get to a bus. It is not just 500 metres away--that is just the hill--then they have to go over the hill and down the other side another 400 metres. They have to walk almost a kilometre to get to a bus stop so they can go shopping. Let us get some real, genuine, fair dinkum infrastructure happening at a local level in the Gold Coast area. Having said all that, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.13 pm): I rise to speak briefly, and probably a bit more quietly than the previous speakers tonight, on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). Firstly, I refer to the adoption of national compliance and enforcement reforms for heavy vehicles. The reforms are designed to improve compliance with and enforcement of heavy vehicle operating requirements by adopting the package developed by the National Transport Commission. One very important aim of these reforms is to improve road safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127065"></A>
Research shows that heavy vehicles are overrepresented in crashes causing fatalities. In a state as large as Queensland and a country like Australia road transport will continue to play a dominant role in freight movement. So it is therefore extremely important that we have responsible national legislation to ensure road safety and better occupational workplace health and safety to continue the viability of the industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127067"></A>
So what is government doing about road safety? The Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995 will be amended to incorporate two additional measures and two court order provisions which are designed to assist in reducing noncompliance with heavy vehicle operating requirements. Authorised officers will be able to issue improvement notices and formal warnings providing more flexibility for enforcement. It will enable consideration to be given on a case-by-case basis to the most appropriate means of dealing with behaviour which represents a safety risk to road users. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127068"></A>
This bill also has an environment that encourages officers to work with operators to assist them to comply with the legislation rather than issuing a penalty infringement notice or commencing court proceedings. Allowing enforcement officers to work proactively with heavy vehicle operators means addressing dangerous behaviours through such things as the imposition of conditions on heavy vehicle operators which must be complied with to avoid the commission of an offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127069"></A>
Currently under the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995 the court can impose fines or a commercial benefits penalty order when a person is found guilty of committing a heavy vehicle offence. Now there will be two new court based sanctions. These are the supervisory intervention orders and compensation orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127070"></A>
I wish to speak on the declaration of state toll road corridor land and local government tollway corridor land. The amendments to the state toll road corridor provisions of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 will extend the categories of the land that are eligible to be declared by the minister to be state toll road corridor land, streamline the administrative processes for the creation of the relevant leases of land declared by the minister to be the state toll road corridor land and appropriately deal with interests that may be affected by any such declaration made by the minister. For consistency, similar amendments are being made to the local government tollway corridor provisions in the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994. I believe there really is a need for long-term planning of road, bus and rail corridors. Government needs to acquire the land and plan for these corridors early--plan for the future. This makes it very clear to all those involved--planners, residents and purchasers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127073"></A>
I want to make mention of the Gateway Motorway, a key component in a national and state road transport network. We saw that corridor sitting waiting to be developed for many years. When the Gateway Motorway is completed in mid-2011 there will be at least three lanes in each direction stretching from Nudgee to Rochedale and continuing on to Carrara on the Gold Coast via the Pacific Motorway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127074"></A>
The Gateway Upgrade Project is upgrading 24 kilometres of motorway between Miles Platting Road, Rochedale, and Nudgee Road, Nudgee. The upgrade is providing a minimum of six traffic lanes, the new Gateway Bridge and seven kilometres of new motorway to provide a faster connection to the Brisbane Airport. This is very important to my constituents as it will reduce travel times, increase reliability of travel and improve safety for motorists. I congratulate the government on the Gateway Motorway project. It will make quite a big difference to my constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127076"></A>
It will also have an effect on the M1 at the Eight Mile Plains exit and therefore have an effect on my constituents. Currently, the upgrade of the M1 at Daisy Hill is taking place. We are all glad to see this occur. Planning for the upgrade of the M1 in other sections of Logan is well advanced. This also includes the planning for the continuation of the busway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127077"></A>
It was through the election of the Rudd government that we got the fifty-fifty funding for the M1 upgrade at Daisy Hill. Tonight I am calling on the Rudd government and the Minister for Main Roads and the Minister for Transport, who are in the chamber, to all work together and keep introducing the funding that we need to continue this upgrade through Logan. In order to keep progressing with the upgrade we need this funding. It is a huge gateway to the National Highway. Not only are tourists using it but residents travelling to and from the Gold Coast and from Logan to Brisbane are using it. Freight operators also use this road. It is an important part of our road network. I ask that they continue to work together and keep the funding coming. That is very important to my constituents. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.18 pm): I rise to speak briefly on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I congratulate the opposition spokesperson on the speech she made in the parliament this afternoon. She covered most of the points exceptionally well. There are a couple of issues I would like to raise in the parliament tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131617"></A>
One issue I have with the transport amendment bill pertains to land acquisition. I have in my constituency Tom and John Ferris who live at an intersection which is going to be developed into a roundabout. They have a farm that has a farmhouse and sheds et cetera on it that is being acquired by the department. The department is acquiring about 10,000 square metres from the farm, which, as I said, includes the farmhouse and the sheds. The farmhouse is an older style of Queenslander which is in very good condition. The department has offered a bit over $500,000 for the land. However, when we take into account the situation that this elderly couple are in whereby they need to acquire another home, another shed, a hard stand on which to put it and to transition into a new area, those costs are very considerable. They did not call on the department to acquire their home. They did not call on the department to take over their centre of business--that is, their sheds and their farmhouse. This has created a very considerable amount of anguish for them. As I said, they were quite content to stay there for the rest of their lives. However, their lives have been disturbed quite considerably by this issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131622"></A>
There needs to be more compassion in such circumstances. I have spoken to them and I have been on their property. The cost and the amount of angst involved in shifting from where they are now to something they have to build in a very short period of time is going to cause them a very considerable amount of distress. From my perspective, the department could have possibly offered them the opportunity to be shifted by the department. I am not sure under what sorts of conditions the department operates, but certainly in this case they are an elderly couple of bachelors who were happy to stay on their property but who are being forced off their property by the department. Given that, I think that the department could have taken a little bit more of a generous view in terms of shifting them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131623"></A>
They would love to shift the old Queenslander on to a new site, but with the regulations in place they have to upgrade the building with cyclone bolts which means stripping out all of the walls. They have to eliminate all of the asbestos in the building to shift it to another site. The council charges involved in that are horrendous, and of course they have to connect services such as water, sewerage et cetera to the building once it is shifted on the same property but relocated in a different precinct. In actual fact, the cost of shifting the building would amount to over $500,000 and there is no certainty that it would actually be up to scratch. Their only opportunity now is to look at building a new home which is going to cost them close on the amount of money that they have been offered by the department. In terms of shifting their centre of business, which includes quite a considerable amount of equipment in the shed such as lathes et cetera, they are certainly going to be out of pocket. That is my gripe in terms of that particular section of the bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131626"></A>
In terms of Marine Safety Queensland, I made a speech in parliament earlier this year with respect to the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
. The vessel transit service is currently located at Dalrymple Bay--the reef transit service--but is now being shifted to Townsville. The Dalrymple Bay-Hay Point terminal is one of the busiest terminals in Queensland and possibly even Australia. At any one time there are either close to 100 or over 120 ships anchored off Dalrymple Bay. It has been well documented since that accident that there are a significant number of ships that are rat-running through the reef east of Gladstone. My contention is that the department through Marine Safety Queensland has lost the plot in terms of its responsibility in putting these coal ships through the Great Barrier Reef.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131633"></A>
There has been horrendous legislation that has come from this department blaming farmers and graziers for destroying the reef--that is, that the chemicals that they apply to their crops will ultimately end up in the reef. As far as I am aware--and I have looked at all of the research documents--there have been no chemicals ever found on the outer Barrier Reef. All of the hype, all of the innuendo and all of the abuse that has been thrown at farmers in this respect has to be mitigated by the fact that there are 6,000 to 9,000 ships going through the Barrier Reef each carrying well over 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil without any safeguards at all and without even contacting, in some cases, the vessel transit service operated by Marine Safety Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131637"></A>
I find this quite abysmal. Quite frankly, with all of the hype that has gone on with respect to reloading off Fraser Island and all of the issues that we have seen before us over the last few weeks and the fact that everybody is ducking for cover, this issue needs a full inquiry. As far as I am concerned, the shifting of the vessel transit service from Dalrymple Bay to Townsville does not make any sense at all. I have said that in the parliament before and I state it again. I call on the minister to re-evaluate Marine Safety Queensland and ask some very serious questions about its role in maintaining the safety of the Great Barrier Reef and maintaining the transit of bulk coal carriers through the reef.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131641"></A>
I note all of the issues that have been raised with the new licences. I note that there is a possibility of HR and all of the categories of licence being issued, as well as a marine licence. It seems rather ambiguous, but perhaps the minister can answer in summing-up whether that will be all included on one card. It is great to have all of that information on a card, but where are the readers going to be? Where can that information be downloaded in order to secure a person’s details? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (8.27 pm): The Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) relates to some 25 acts and 12 lots of regulations, but the key issues in this bill relate to the facilitation of privatisation and to matters to put in place the framework for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project and a number of other matters dealing with the issue that I want to speak about--that is, the new licence. Our shadow minister has indicated that, whilst there are some matters within this bill that are worthy of support, there are some issues which we are completely opposed to, and one of course is the issue of privatisation. While there has been a previous bill that has put the privatisation issue in place, this bill facilitates many issues dealing with the privatisation of the tollways, the Brisbane port, QR and so forth, and I want to talk about some of those. It is important to reiterate that privatisation is only being forced upon the state because the government is drowning in debt--$85 billion of debt, $65 billion of which was there from the wasteful spending of the government before the global financial crisis. Through the 10 years of mismanagement that we have seen, we now have this position of debt.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136184"></A>
There is an old saying, ‘If you don’t manage debt and it gets too big, debt manages you.’ That is what we are seeing happen. Many decisions are being made now because of this huge millstone of debt that is around the neck of the government--$85 billion, which comprises the debt of government owned corporations and government debt. Many of these government owned corporations have been loaded up with debt from years of the government getting them to raise their borrowings and transferring them to the government’s coffers. All of that activity is now coming home to roost. Sadly, it is the people who pay. The people who pay and who hurt the most are the people on low and modest incomes. </Hansard-Body>

I have had people, particularly older people, saying to me that they can no longer afford these massive increases in the cost of living that are coming through because of the massive government debt and the huge increases in charges that we are seeing. We are not seeing the usual small increases of three per cent and four per cent in electricity, water and gas; we are seeing massive increases in charges. In just three years the cost of electricity has gone up by some 54 per cent. We are seeing massive increases in the cost of water flowing to councils. We are seeing massive increases in the cost of gas. In Toowoomba--</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Ryan): Order! Member for Toowoomba South, I direct your attention to the purposes of the bill and I ask you to come back to the purposes of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136187"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am just trying to elaborate a little on privatisation and the problems that come with it. With this bill in particular, which deals with transport, driver licences and so forth, we are seeing how motorists are slugged. We have the petrol tax, which was not mentioned before the election. We now have the dearest registration in Australia whereas we always proudly had the cheapest registration. Through this legislation, which facilitates the privatisation of the tollways, we will see all sorts of increases occur and possibly different systems of tolling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136188"></A>
The tragedy of privatisation is that the government is selling assets that I understand deliver a certain amount of money in income that, in total, is more than the interest that will be saved on the debt that the government will be able to retire. I ask members to try to make sense of that. If anyone ran a business in that way and sold off income-earning assets and lost money because the income that was coming in is gone and they had a lesser amount in interest that would have been saved by retiring the debt involved with some of those projects, it just would not make sense at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136189"></A>
Part of this bill relates to national heavy vehicle reform, particularly with regard to compliance and safety. I want to make mention of one of the issues that has been mooted and put forward nationally that will cripple much of the transport industry--that is, the registration cost of trucks, in particular the registration costs of B-doubles and B-triples. It is a well-known fact that B-doubles and B-triples, particularly in the area of livestock transport, are far safer on our roads than road trains. But if this reform is passed and massive increases in registration for B-doubles and B-triples occur, we are going to see people being forced to revert to using road trains. That will make our roads more dangerous, particularly roads such as the Warrego Highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136190"></A>
Each day about 4,000 trucks, many of them stock trucks, come into the western suburbs of Toowoomba to go to the saleyards. The Warrego Highway is one of the most dangerous roads in Australia now and the problem will become very serious. All the cattle that are hauled from the saleyards at Toowoomba are hauled through Toowoomba on some of these 4,000 trucks that each day go down the main street of the city. Whether those trucks are coming from the west and going to Dinmore or Beenleigh or whether they are going from the saleyards, they are all B-doubles and B-triples and they are all going to be facing these massive increases in registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136191"></A>
I call on the minister to look at this issue very carefully, because if we are serious about road safety, if we are serious about having safer big trucks such as B-doubles and B-triples on the road, then the cost of registration for those trucks has to be comparable to the cost of registration of other trailers or road trains, which are just a combination of trailers hooked up one after the other. This issue relates particularly to roads such as the Warrego Highway, which has broken sides and narrow bitumen. Those stock trucks share the Warrego Highway with thousands of coal trucks and grain trucks and trucks going up to Darwin or north-western Queensland or to the mining areas. For safety’s sake, we need to address that issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136192"></A>
The Minister for Main Roads waxed lyrical about funding for roads. I hope he can put the Toowoomba bypass--a very important part of the Warrego Highway--the No. 1 priority for this state. It is all very well to say that it is in the top 10. We know where it is. It is No. 8, 9 or 10 and it has no chance. It is on the never-never. Already, $45 million has been spent on procuring the road corridor, for drilling the test tunnel through the range and for the finalised detailed plans. That has all been done and is ready to go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136193"></A>
When the Rudd government got into power in 2007, one of the very first things it did was cancel the $700 million that had been allocated for the road at the end of the first three-year period of the budget. It cancelled that and got rid of it. That is how much the Rudd government thought of Toowoomba. That is how much it thought of Queensland and all the industry that uses that road through the city--4,000 trucks going along Toowoomba’s main east-west road, through 16 sets of traffic lights, all jostling with mothers who are trying to take their kids to school. No other city in Australia would have to put up with that. It is a social blight on the city of Toowoomba. It is dangerous. The road breaks up. It lasts for only a few months and then the left-hand lane is broken. The trucks can only get from one set of lights to the next and they have to stop again. There are six to eight trucks at a time at every light change on both sides of the road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136194"></A>
The tragedy is that one of the very first acts of the Rudd government on coming to power was to cancel the money for the Toowoomba bypass, which is one of the most important arteries in Queensland. In fact, 70 per cent of the exports of this state that go across the wharf at the Port of Brisbane, which this government wants to sell off and privatise, comes through the city of Toowoomba from west of the range. It is one of the most important economic arteries of the nation and what the Rudd government did, in turning its back on it, was a tragedy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136195"></A>
The Rudd government threw $900 to people, amounting to nearly $25 billion. It gave that money away, but it has just walked away from things that are important--things that will last and things that will give jobs forever. It wanted to get some sort of cheap electoral popularity by handing out $900 to people and seeing the poker machines roll around. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136196"></A>
The issue of the driver’s licence is of concern. I have mentioned the massive cost that people are facing. After many years of talking about this licence, it is now programmed to come in perhaps late this year in Toowoomba only as a test run. I am concerned that people in Toowoomba are going to be paying more for their licences than are people in the rest of the state. The people of Toowoomba will be used as guinea pigs to see if the licence works. You would certainly hope that it works a little better than the payroll system that the government brought in and some of the other technology that has flopped. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136197"></A>
At the moment a licence costs around $75 or $78. Once the new licence is fully implemented, the cost of a licence for five years will at least double, or more than double. So those people in Toowoomba who have to take up a licence at the end of this year, when this test run is commenced, will be the only ones in Queensland paying that extra money. That does not seem fair, particularly as the people of Toowoomba do not have access to the TransLink card like the people to the north and south of Brisbane have. The people of Toowoomba cannot hop on a train, like the people in Gympie can, and get down to Brisbane. Those people who are pensioners or those people who want to travel by train to get to medical services do not have that opportunity. The rail service ceases at Ipswich. If the people of Toowoomba want to travel on a QR train, they have to go down to Helidon, catch a bus and trundle through the farmlands of the Lockyer and all around the back of Ipswich and eventually get on a train at Ipswich and travel to Brisbane. I think that is a 3-hour trip whereas by car it takes about an hour and a half. So that is the sort of shambles of public transport that is available to serve the people in the Toowoomba area. Once again, we see the Labor government snubbing its nose at Toowoomba. As far as they are concerned, everything stops pretty well at Ipswich. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136233"></A>
The most important part of this bill is the facilitation regarding the various assets that are going to be sold. One of the big questions that needs to be asked is what rail lines are actually going to be sold. I challenge the minister to tell us tonight what lines. Are they thinking of selling the coal or freight lines that go through Toowoomba? Our shadow minister has asked again and again what lines in Central Queensland and north of Central Queensland will be privatised? Exactly which ones? We need to have that answer. We have coal and freight trains going through Toowoomba. What will happen to them? Will they just be left? What is going to be the future of the rail workers in the railway workshops in Toowoomba? We have heard before that Queensland Rail is not for sale. Now we need the government to tell us the truth about what are the exact lines it is actually planning on selling. What are the above-rail services of QR and the below-rail assets that they wish to sell. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136236"></A>
They are the problems that we have with privatisation. There is also the issue of tollways. What will happen with those tollways? Will there be more tolling stations inserted within the tollways themselves? What will happen with the Brisbane port and the charges on exports of grain and coal and other goods from western and south-western Queensland? What will happen to all of those charges under this bill with its facilitation of the various aspects of the privatisation of the Brisbane port? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

This government is drowning in debt because it has mismanaged government for 10 years. It has racked up massive debt--more than New South Wales, more than any other state. The chickens are coming home to roost. As a result the ordinary working class people of our state, the pensioners and everybody else will have to put their hands in their pockets to pay through the nose for these massive increases in the price of water, gas, power, registration, petrol and all the rest of it. It might be the government’s debt, but at the end of the day it is the people who will have to pay. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (8.42 pm): I am proud to rise and speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 because this is the first piece of legislation that I am addressing as an Independent member of this parliament. If this legislation that we see before the parliament tonight is not passed by the House then we cannot sell two of our state assets: rail and port. I would make that point again because it is well worth making. I do not think it has really been addressed by those members here tonight. If this legislation is not passed by this House tonight then we cannot begin the process of selling off our state assets: rail and coal.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136243"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can hear members interjecting, but it is going to be a very interesting time when it does come to a vote in the chamber tonight because--and I do not want to pre-empt what the other Independents may or may not do with their vote--it will be the first time that there will be more than five Independents. If the Independents vote against the sale of the assets and against this piece of legislation it will be the first time in recent history when there will be enough Independents to actually force a vote and for it to be recorded. What we will see if that wonderful situation exists is both the Labor Party and the LNP voting for this piece of legislation, because all the members--the shadow minister and member after member in the LNP--have jumped to their feet, made very, very passionate speeches about stopping the sale of assets in Queensland but nonetheless they have all indicated that they will vote for this legislation. In other words, they are going to vote for the sale of assets because this legislation contains two vitally important steps in the sale of our state assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136244"></A>
We will be able to see whether we will be able to match actions with words. This legislation is another reason why we need an upper house in Queensland. Failing that, what Queensland needs is a strong group of Independents who are prepared to put their communities first, before party politics. The best situation that we could see in Queensland, apart from having an upper house, is a parliament where there is more balance and there is a strong group of Independents acting as, if you like, a de facto upper house. This piece of legislation would never, ever pass through a parliament that had a strong group of Independents representing their community, putting their community first, because their community does not want the sale of Queensland assets. Eighty per cent of the people of Queensland--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136246"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. Ninety-five per cent in the member for Nanango’s electorate do not want the sale of assets. Certainly within the Burnett, the rail workers know that by selling off the coal division within Queensland Rail it will mean that we will no longer be able to subsidise the passenger division and we will miss out on that income stream, the $600 million-odd a year that goes into subsidising all the passenger divisions, including the cost of tickets in the south-east corner. The people of Brisbane will end up with higher rail fares once this sale of state assets has gone through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136247"></A>
Why would I vote in this chamber for a piece of legislation that enables and facilitates the sale of our state assets? It just does not make sense. As we have seen, both sides of this place have indicated that they will be supporting this legislation, admittedly with severe reservations, but that does not cut it when a member goes out into their community and talks to their union members and the people in the street and says, ‘Yes, I oppose the asset sales but, yes, I also voted for legislation that enabled it.’ It just does not cut it. I would suggest that members of the LNP will now have to go back to their electorates and explain to the people who voted for them, the 80 per cent plus of people who oppose the asset sales, why they are voting for this legislation. They may or may not change their mind by the time it comes to the vote, but there may be a vote and in that vote for the first time in recent history in the Queensland parliament we will have a quorum and there will be a vote recorded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136248"></A>
We know amongst all the good things that are buried in this Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill there are two sections which allow the sale of state assets. I know that because if one goes to page 152 we see ‘Amendment of Transport Infrastructure (Ports) Regulation 2005’ and then on page 153 ‘Amendment of Transport Infrastructure (Rail) Regulation 2006’. Those two particular sections will facilitate the sale of assets. The minister in her second reading speech indicates that there will be a sale of state assets, although she speaks rather cryptically about it. She speaks in code. She said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1136250"></A>
Third, the bill will amend legislation to create a robust port planning regime for the future, maintain Queensland Rail as a passenger focused government owned corporation and establish QRNational as a proud, Queensland based company. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1136251"></A>
And that, of course, is code for ‘We are flogging off the assets of Queensland’.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141003"></A>
I know that the rank and file union members that I marched with on Labour Day would not like this piece of legislation voted for and passed. I think those members will be very, very disappointed in members of the government if they do support this legislation. People have lost sight of the fact that amongst this bill, which amends the 25-odd acts, at the very heart of this legislation are those two sections which enable these asset sales. After speaking with the rank and file members on that Labour Day, I cannot see how any of those rank and file members, the ones who booed the Deputy Premier, the ones who I believe had a crack at the member for Rockhampton when he went to speak on Labour Day, would not be very upset that this legislation was being debated and put forward in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141006"></A>
Many members have asked why are we forced to sell off our assets. The reason that we are forced to sell off our assets is that this government has lost control of our public assets. We are facing mountains of debt. This year there is going to be $23 billion worth of debt, so we are looking at around $6 million a day in interest payments alone. That will climb in a couple of years time to almost $50 billion worth of debt. The interest payments will almost double to around $13 million a day. There are future predictions of debt higher than $80 billion. That debt amounts to the state being at the mercy of the international credit rating agencies, who downgraded our credit rating from AAA to AA. We now have to pay more for the money that we are borrowing. This month alone we were looking at about $7 billion worth of bonds maturing and having to come up with that money. The selling off of these assets is a very short-term fix. We need the money very quickly to at least stop a further downgrading of our asset ratings. We have virtually got a gun being held to our head by credit rating agencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141009"></A>
One of the things that many members have probably missed in this whole debate about asset sales is the actual cost. Some figures that I have seen indicate that after selling off $15 billion worth of assets we are only ahead by $1.5 billion nett. What members on the other side and what members of the LNP have failed to do so far is to shed some light on the actual cost of the asset sales. How much right now is this government paying consultants to prepare those assets for sale--how many hundreds of millions of dollars? What sort of commissions are going to be paid on the sale of these assets? Will there be any stamp duty paid in other states on these assets? No-one has talked about this. The government has not talked about this. The LNP has not talked about this. This is an issue that the whole of Queensland should be involved in: the cost of these asset sales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141010"></A>
We put politics last. We put people first. We are out here representing our community. Not one person in the Burnett has come to me and said, ‘We want these asset sales to go ahead. In fact, recently the member for Beaudesert and I went on a trip to Cairns and we spoke up there--we did what no other member, at least of the LNP, can do; we had productive talks with rank and file union members in Cairns. We sat down and we had a good discussion with those people. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They want us to send a message to those on the opposite side who are giggling about the asset sales. They want to delay the sale of assets until after the next federal election. They want to allow a special state conference of the ALP to debate the asset sales because in this whole issue the rank and file members have never had an opportunity to put their views before their elected members. The rank and file members of the ALP have been denied a debate on this whole issue. They are saying, especially in North Queensland, that they are going to make the sale of the state assets a federal government issue, a federal election issue. The sitting members up there, Jim Turnour and Jan McLucas, cannot run away from this particular issue. I know that they do not want to make the sale of state assets a federal issue, but it is going to be a federal issue. The members in Cairns have a duty and a responsibility to their party members to represent their views. They want Kevin Rudd to say to Anna Bligh, ‘Delay the asset sales until after the next federal election. We’ll have the debate.’ If Kevin Rudd really wanted to and if Tony Abbott really wanted to, they could stop the sale of state assets. There may be some--</Hansard-Body>

 I withdraw. As the member for Nanango quite rightly points out, it does not really matter what any member of this House says. Later on tonight they will be able to show how they feel about the sale of state assets through the vote that will come about because, for the first time in the recent history of the Queensland parliament, there will be a quorum of Independents. I do not want to make assumptions about how the other Independents will vote. People will be able to vote with their feet. In this parliament they will be able to show exactly how they feel about the provisions of the bill. We look forward to that demonstration. </Hansard-Body>

In closing, I note that many members have commended the bill. In fact, I do the opposite. I reject the bill, even though it has some good provisions. However, the bill is so tainted by the two clauses enabling and allowing the sale of assets that I could not possibly, in good conscience, representing the views of my community, vote for this bill. </Hansard-Body>

 (Nanango--Ind) (9.00 pm): I rise to make a small contribution to this debate. I am not opposed to improving Queensland state infrastructure. I am not opposed to improving infrastructure and services. I am not at all opposed to minimising costs to commuters and encouraging them to get onto public transport, thus getting their cars off roads. Tonight, many LNP members endorsed the bill and I too would like to commend the bill to the House, but I cannot. I cannot because this bill facilitates the sale of Queensland assets and I am opposed to that. Since it was first mooted that assets would be sold, people have come into my office literally yelling at my staff and me to stop this sale and calling on me to talk to the unions, because they may have enough strength to stop the sale of the assets. It has been constant, day after day, to the point where my staff are getting quite sensitive. I try to defuse the situation, but some people will not listen. They walk in and immediately start to yell and carry on--we cannot get a word in--then they storm out again. I do not know who voted for me, but I know that many of the people who come to my office voted Labor. They tell me that if the sale goes ahead, they will not do that again. </Hansard-Body>

Only yesterday before I came down to Brisbane, I was in a shopping centre and a gentleman followed me into five different stores. He started off by saying, ‘How are you going to stop this sale?’ I said, ‘I can’t.’ I said, ‘It’s going to have to be a strong move by the public and the unions to stop this government selling our assets.’ He thought about it for a while and then went away. Then he followed me into the next store and the next store and the next store. He told me to speak to Bill Ludwig, he told me to speak to other union officials, he told me to speak to anybody and everybody he could think of because he was so concerned. He said he was a Labor voter, but that if the sale went through he would not vote Labor again. I will not say ‘all’, because I have not spoken to every member of my community, but of the people who have come into my office, 99.9 per cent are opposed to the asset sales. They are opposed to the sale of the Port of Brisbane, the forestry assets and the rail assets. Each and every one of them says the same thing: you do not unload your assets unless you are buying a better one. They cannot see that there is a better one on the horizon for this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

The people I have been speaking to and who have spoken to me are quite concerned about the privatisation that occurred with the airports and electricity, which provides the latest example of prices going up and up and up. When you privatise a monopoly, that is bound to happen. That is what people are afraid of. The government continually has its hand in their pockets. Ministers from various portfolios will say, ‘It’s only $1.80’ or ‘It’s only the price of a can of coke’. They will say it is only a little bit here and there, but each year all those little bits add up to hundreds and hundreds of dollars. People do not have the money, because their wages do not go up in the same way. Monopolies will put the prices up on their commodities, and they will do that because they have a captive clientele. </Hansard-Body>

The driver’s licence fee is going up, registration has gone up and fuel has gone up. The cost of everything is getting higher and higher and higher. I am concerned about the new licences and privacy issues. Perhaps that will always be a concern. The simple fact is that there are criminals in our world and they have only one concern: to get as much money as they can as fast as they can. They do not care if they break the rules. Therefore, we can guarantee that criminals will get readers. I am pretty sure it will not take more than a few weeks to a month after the new licenses are introduced and criminals will be able to find a way to read the information on them. I do not believe the security is as good as has been claimed. There is another group who do not class themselves as criminals. They are the techno-nerds. They like a challenge and they will happily meet that challenge. It might take them a day, a month or a bit longer, but they will do it because they have to have a challenge. Generally, the average person does not view information technology as a challenge to be overcome, but there is a group of people who want the thrill of being able to conquer new technology. </Hansard-Body>

No-one objects to improvements to infrastructure, services and many of the things that the bill addresses. In the South Burnett we would really love the transport that Brisbane has. People who have to access medical services have to get from Kingaroy to Toowoomba or down to Brisbane, but there is no regular bus service if there is a bus service at all. Many people do not have family in the area, and it is a major difficulty to access transport to seek medical services, which may be essential to them. We would be happy to see that situation improved. As I have heard mentioned tonight, some people would just like a bus service so that they can get into town to do the shopping. In my electorate, we do not have that. We do not have a port, we do not have public transport and there is virtually no rail service any more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145770"></A>
Therefore, one could think that the bill does not really affect my constituents and perhaps I should not have a say. However, the bill does affect our assets. It prepares our assets for sale. It reminds me of what happens when people go to sell their house. The very first thing anyone does before selling a house is to spruce it up and they spend a fortune doing so. Often I have heard people say, ‘We’ve been meaning to do this for 25 years and now we’re selling it. I just got it done and I really like it, but we have to sell it.’ Typically, that signals that something is about to be put up for sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145771"></A>
I believe that, whether they believe it or not, by supporting this bill the LNP supports the sale of our assets. That is particularly sad when I know--and I believe most members of this House also know--that the majority of people in this state do not want the assets sold. If that was not part of the bill, I would be happy to support it. However, because the government is preparing the assets for sale, I will be opposing the bill. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (9.09 pm): I rise to speak on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. The government has repeatedly used the word ‘infrastructure’, which is one of my favourite words coming from the electorate of Beaudesert, which is the second fastest growing region in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 South-East Queensland. I thank the member for Yeerongpilly. I have been pushing for a passenger railway and a lot of infrastructure in the Beaudesert electorate, and I will be keeping that fair and square on the agenda. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150569"></A>
Amidst the shopping list of amendments in this bill, however, whilst there are elements that I do recommend, there are some very dangerous parts in here in clauses 128 and 129 in relation to the amendment of the Transport Infrastructure (Ports) Regulation 2005 and clauses 130 and 131 in relation to the amendment of the Transport Infrastructure (Rail) Regulation 2006. These amendments represent taking one step closer to the sale of our assets in Queensland--one step closer to the splitting of QR into QR National and QR Passenger on 1 July in preparation for public tender. This is one more nail in the coffin of Queenslanders who have put their blood, sweat and tears into building this state over the last 150 or more years, ensuring that this great state of ours is kept in the ownership of its shareholders--that is, the Queensland taxpayers. In fact, my grandfather was instrumental in the building and construction industry right here in Queensland before spending a further 21 years at Newport Constructions in Melbourne. He worked on the railways. It is stories like my grandfather’s, Bernard, and our forefathers who have pioneered this country to a point where it has paid off and has become an enormous investment for our children and our children’s children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150573"></A>
I believe wholeheartedly that the ports, rail, electricity and water--basic commodities--should be enshrined in federal legislation and always protected by and for the Australian people. I note that the legislation refers to the possibility of these being owned by Queensland based companies. But there is no guarantee that they will stay in the hands of Queensland based companies. More often than not, they fall into foreign ownership. We have seen particularly recently the Rudd government accessing huge amounts of royalties and now it wants to tax the profits that the mines make. That too will happen when foreign ownership takes over our ports and rail, as we have seen with electricity as well. What happens when the government gets its fair share of the profits that foreign owners make? You end up with a bidding war between the foreign owners and the government. At the end of the day, the taxpayer will be left to pay, and the debt will be inherited by our kids; they will be left to pay for these spontaneous and irresponsible acts that we are seeing before us here today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150574"></A>
It never ceases to amaze me. It does not matter how many energy-saving efficient light globes I put into my house and how many solar hot-water systems--you name it, every measure possible--every three months the bills still keep going up. We have been hoodwinked with electricity. The same thing will happen with our ports and rail. The day will come. We have pensioners living on an average of $38 a day. Does anyone comprehend that--$38 a day! We will see in our time, as is happening already, pensioners using candles. That is the dire situation facing the have-nots. That is exactly what privatisation of basic commodities has done--basic commodities which should always stay in the hands of the shareholders for future generations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150575"></A>
In relation to the sale of assets, if we look closely at the US free trade agreement, there is no protection of jobs. The government has said that there will be guaranteed protection of jobs for two years. That is not true. Like the forced council amalgamation, that is not true. It will happen. It has happened and it will happen again. We need to be honourable enough to be able to balance the books, to trim down on waste, to find efficiencies, to look for better policy, not to constantly raise the bottom line. If this were a business run by private enterprise, the lot of us would be sacked. That is the reality. We cannot keep doing what we are doing. There is no such thing when you are renting a house that it is an investment. That is exactly what we are doing. We are selling the house to pay off the credit cards. That is exactly what is happening. It is an irresponsible act. It shows complete disrespect for all of the shareholders, being the taxpayers who have gone before us as well who have built this great state of ours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150576"></A>
The day will come when we will have to monitor how many times we leave our homes because of the cost of the tollways. We have seen it with the Clem7 tunnel already. They are going to have to backtrack because of the lack of people using it. That expense will constantly go up. That infrastructure is no longer an investment if we flog it off for short-term benefit to balance the books; it is a false economy. I believe that the bill before us here tonight is absolutely laced with aspects to facilitate taking one more step down the slippery slope of selling our assets. I will not support this bill. I cannot support this bill knowing what it will do for our children and our children’s children. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (9.15 pm): I want to make a contribution to the debate on this bill and on several aspects of the bill. There are a number of sections I wish to discuss. Firstly, I want to discuss the issue of the state toll road corridor land and the declarations by the minister that are going to be facilitated by the amendments in this legislation. What we have got here with the provision of this legislation is the basis for distance based tolling. We know that it is the intention of this Labor government, with its asset sales, to introduce distance based tolling. We have a Premier who travelled overseas who likes the idea of charging people in the high-occupancy vehicle lanes for using roads they have already paid for. We know that this government is desperately short of money and is desperately seeking to jack up the price it will receive when it sells the Port of Brisbane motorway, when it sells the assets of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150582"></A>
We know that the original toll was for the bridge when it was first built in 1986. It was a toll to pay for crossing the river, not a toll to pay for travelling the kilometres of roadway either side of it. Let me just in passing deal with the rewriting of history by the Labor Party and the Labor government in the last couple of weeks with respect to the second Gateway Bridge and how it was the brainchild of the former Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Minister Lucas, and how he ought to be commended for it. That is wrong. That bridge was being planned way back, before Minister Lucas ever thought about being the transport minister. Way back in 2000, when I was the councillor for Hamilton, I was first briefed by the Department of Transport and Main Roads about the construction of the second Gateway Bridge, the second Gateway crossing. The construction of it was due to commence in 2001, but it never did commence because Labor then like Labor now was broke. Terry Mackenroth was running structural deficit budgets and could not afford to build it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150588"></A>
Let us deal with the facts, not with the rewriting of history that Labor goes on with. Let us deal with the facts: that bridge was planned long before this Labor government was able to get anywhere near it. We hear that it has been delivered early and under budget; it has been delivered late and over budget, and it has cost Queenslanders and Queensland businesses millions and millions of dollars because this government is so serially incapable of delivering infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150589"></A>
What we have now is the infrastructure in the gantries that have been built all along the Gateway Motorway--gantries that hang like Damocles over the head of Queensland motorists, over the head of every motorist who chooses to use the Gateway Motorway and the Gateway Bridge. The threat of distance based tolling follows the increase in tolls announced a few short months ago. We are now, as other speakers have indicated, seeing yet another attempt at a tax grab by a government that went broke in a boom--a government that was unable to maintain the fuel levy, a government that effectively introduced a 9.2c a litre tax on every motorist in Queensland, a government that increased car registration fees by between 17 and 23 per cent, a government that has made Queensland the most expensive place in Australia to own, operate and drive a motor vehicle. That is the legacy of this government. That is the legacy of this government’s control of the assets and the infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150593"></A>
I heard the Minister for Main Roads say earlier that this government is the only one that delivers on its promises. He obviously forgets the Premier’s promise on the fuel tax--the promise that she would not kick Queenslanders while they were down, the promise made before the last election, the promise reinforced by her Treasurer. As soon as they were elected, that promise was so easily and quickly abandoned without a hint of any form of remorse for their actions, for their deceit, for their deception of the people of Queensland. So the people of Queensland know the value of Labor promises. When it comes to motor vehicles, the value of Labor promises is the only value to go down in Queensland because the value of Premier Bligh’s promises to the people of Queensland is zero. So when the Minister for Main Roads says that there is a promise not to introduce distance based tolling, the people of Queensland just do not believe this government, with good cause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155398"></A>
Talking of tollways, let me raise the issue of Airport Link in the electorate of Clayfield--Australia’s largest toll road project. It has been referred to by other speakers in this place. I have been involved with this project from the very beginning. I support the project and its outcomes, including better traffic flows on local roads and easing congestion on the north side of Brisbane through many electorates and out to the airport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155402"></A>
It is also important to note the genesis of this project in the Brisbane City Council Liberal team’s TransApex vision--a vision already proceeding with the Clem7 tunnel, the Go Between Bridge and the prospective Northern Link. More than just roads, it is a plan that also includes over 500 low-emission gas buses over the four years of the current period. On top of the more than 250 buses delivered in the first term of the Newman council administration, we will see almost a doubling of the number of low-emission gas buses in Brisbane--a record and something beyond the wildest dreams of the moribund Soorley and Quinn Labor administrations, who between them could barely buy 100 new buses in four years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155407"></A>
Airport Link has its issues. Firstly, there is the issue of secrecy--the secrecy of the government owned corporation charged with oversight of the Airport Link contractors, BrisConnections and Thiess John Holland. It is a secrecy that this Labor government seems completely determined to maintain, a secrecy that the independent Information Commissioner says is unjustified and unsupported by the law, a secrecy that City North Infrastructure now wants to protect by appealing to the Supreme Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155412"></A>
The question is: why is the supposed watchdog fighting to keep its records secret and why is this Bligh Labor government aiding and abetting it? Simply what are they hiding and why are they are forcing the residents they should be protecting to pay Supreme Court costs in this appeal? The question the residents of Clayfield, Wooloowin, Kedron and Stafford are asking is: where is the local member for Stafford and infrastructure minister in all of this? Why does he support this action by CNI? Why does he not support his local community? Why has he gone missing on this issue? I call on the Premier, the Treasurer and Minister Hinchliffe to direct CNI to stop this appeal and to release the information to the local people. Stop hiding and cancel the CNI appeal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155417"></A>
The issue of toll roads, Airport Link and the declaration of lands that make up Airport Link is a significant issue on the north side of Brisbane that this government continues to ignore. The declaration allows works to be able to continue 24 hours a day in sensitive receiving areas--in Kalinga Park, in Wooloowin and in Kedron. There are concerns about noise, about working hours and about safety. There are concerns about family life, trucks in local streets, damage to roads and damage to infrastructure. So these are real issues affecting the lives of people in my electorate. We have a government strangely and seemingly complicit in these activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155419"></A>
To top it off, the residents of Clayfield have had a large work site established where one was never contemplated. The rights of the residents have been ridden over roughshod. I objected to the construction of the work site and the large shed on that site because they change the project fundamentally. They change the project fundamentally by reweighting the risk profile away from the private sector, who were prepared to take the risk when there was a big profit, and onto the community when the profit looked like it would not be there. They fundamentally change the basis of the risk of the project. That rejects the principles of a public-private partnership in developing toll roads. That is the principle of the appropriate allocation of risk. Risk flows with the money. Where the profit is likely to be there also should be the risk. That has not been the case in this instance. The state and the contractor, in building this Airport Link toll road, have effectively transferred their risk to the people of Clayfield. This is the fundamental problem with this government’s actions in allowing this work site to proceed. </Hansard-Body>

I now want to turn to the amendments to the provisions about limousine record-keeping requirements.

 I am getting too much information. I am glad that Mr Speaker is not in the chair because he may well remember this discussion as well. We discussed it at length on 9 October 2007. I raised the issue of an electronic booking device for limousines. We spoke about it at length. We spoke about the consultation that had been undertaken by the department with the limousine industry. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It was a significant issue for the limousine industry. It is okay for the member for Everton, who, as we know, has control of the keys, to have a joke about it, but it was a significant issue for the limousine industry when this legislation was introduced. It was introducing a new cost and a new requirement that in fact physically could not be done. There was no such machine. There was no electronic booking device that could be fitted to a vehicle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155427"></A>
The Limousine Association went to the department for two years saying, ‘This cannot be done. We have searched the world and there is no such machine.’ The transport department kept coming back and saying, ‘You’re wrong, you’re wrong, you’re wrong’--all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. They sought meetings with the then minister. They sought meetings with the Premier. They sought meetings with the then minister’s parliamentary secretary to explain the difficulties that they would face with this unworkable requirement of the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155429"></A>
If ever there was an instance of bureaucracy riding over the common sense of the people in the industry it was that part of the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 which inserted new sections 87A to 87D. I remember them very clearly, Minister. We saw a transport department determined to push through its bureaucratically driven requirement for an electronic booking device. As I said, we debated the meaning of the word ‘fitted’. We debated the consultation process. We spoke at length about it. We spoke about the hardship and the ridiculousness of this particular requirement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155430"></A>
Now we have in this legislation a very carefully worded backdown. What do the explanatory notes say? They say that the legislation will ‘make the record-keeping requirements for limousine bookings the same as the current requirements for special purpose limousine bookings’. It does not go so far as to say, ‘We got it wrong last time.’ It does not go so far as to say, ‘This can never be delivered. It was a furphy. It was false. It was ridiculous bureaucratic drivel,’ which is what it should say if it were speaking in plain English to the people of Queensland. What it is trying to do is weasel its way out of any obligation, of any responsibility, of any mea culpa for having done the wrong thing, for having gotten it so substantially wrong. ‘Make the record-keeping requirements for limousine bookings the same as the current special purpose limousine bookings,’ is what it says. That is a pencil and paper. That is what that means. In other words, it is a complete craven cave-in by a government that will never admit that it is wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155432"></A>
We also see amendments in this legislation to deal with the smart driver’s licence. How long have we been waiting for this driver’s licence to come through? I think we are now on minister No. 3 or 4 in respect of this. How much was it originally going to cost? Zero. What was it going to be able to do? It was going to be preloaded with credit. One could go into Macca’s and buy a burger, go into the Coffee Club and buy a cup of coffee, pay parking fines. It would be loaded with information. It was going to be the wonder card devised almost by the wonder dog for use by drivers all over Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

 It might have even been able to be used by limo drivers. That is exactly right; the member for Everton is dead right. It might have been, but sadly it will not be able to be. Because what have we got? We have got a $110 million dud, a dud with a fancy photograph. That is all we have got for $110 million of Queensland taxpayers’ money, unbudgeted for six years ago. Every year it just creeps up that little bit more until we have now spent $110 million on a driver’s licence with a chip in it that cannot do anything. Is it any wonder Queensland has gone broke? Is it any wonder!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160342"></A>
This card which was promised has been delivered to us, and I feel sorry for the current minister. She has to pick up all of the mess. She has to fix up the driver’s licence, the port legislation, the go card, TransLink and all of the other debacles that have been left behind, and I lay the blame squarely at the feet of the Deputy Premier. The Deputy Premier: the genius behind the go card that was delivered six years late and over budget and when it was first used did not work and still cannot offer all of the fare options of the old paper ticket; the Deputy Premier, responsible for electricity supply when in 2004 we saw the lights go off all over Queensland; the Deputy Premier, responsible for the smart licence that has not delivered any smart but just a fancy photograph; the Deputy Premier, responsible for the biggest payroll bungle in Queensland’s history in the Queensland Health department that cannot even see his own employees being paid. That is the genesis of the thought process behind the smart driver’s licence--a technological ‘Tour de Farce’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160350"></A>
In the couple of minutes I have left, I want to talk about the port and rail amendments and the amendments that are being put in place to facilitate the sale of the assets. We in the LNP in the past have opposed amendments that have sought to facilitate the sale of assets. The LNP has opposed the asset sales from day one. From the day the budget that contemplated the sale of those assets was brought into this House--from the day the legislation was brought into this House and shamefully rushed through by a government that deceived the people of Queensland by saying that it had no plans to sell assets but as soon as it got re-elected started formulating its plans to sell assets--that legislation has been consistently and coherently opposed by the LNP, and the LNP continues to oppose the forced, rushed sale of assets imposed on the people of Queensland by the Australian Labor Party.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160352"></A>
One has to ask the question: how do you stop this Labor privatisation? You stop this Labor privatisation by voting in an alternative LNP government. You stop this privatisation by voting in a government that is formed by a party that has a consistent and clear position and a policy to stop the asset sales. You do not stop asset sales by marching with unionists who funded the re-election of a Labor government. You do not march with the paymasters who continue to support the government’s sale of assets. You do not march with the unionists who support Kevin Rudd’s big new mining tax that is anti-Queensland, anti-investment and anti-communities. You stop the asset sales by forming an alternative government. You stop the asset sales by providing an alternative for the people of Queensland to vote for from this discredited, disreputable, broke Labor government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160355"></A>
Let me make it clear: we oppose the asset sales proposed by the Labor Party. We have always opposed the asset sales proposed by this government. We argued all night against the asset sales legislation. We argued until 4 am in the morning against the asset sales until the debate was guillotined by the Labor Party. We are committed to stopping these assets sales. Only the LNP can stop these asset sales. Only the LNP has the capacity to do it. You do not do it by marching with the union paymasters of your political opponents. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (9.34 pm): I believe that on the issue of privatisation and sale of assets the government is completely out of touch with what the average Queenslander thinks about privatisation and that the opposition cannot make up its mind whether it is listening to John Howard or JP Langbroek on this issue. In the seven years that I have been in parliament, I have never seen such unprecedented opposition to a particular course of action the government is taking or the government is proposing to take. Out in voter land this is the death knell of politics. People are looking at this and saying, ‘We cannot believe that a Labor government is planning to sell the family farm in the vain hope of balancing the budget.’ It is a little bit like going to the bank and saying, ‘I’ll take a few extra credit cards to pull all the debts together and pay them off with that.’ It is a downward spiral. It is an economic slippery slope of unprecedented proportions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160362"></A>
I remember sitting in this House a number of years ago listening to former Premier Peter Beattie hand on heart telling Queenslanders that the privatisation of electricity was the only way that we could see power become affordable for pensioners and overall lower the price of electricity in Queensland. I only have two words to say about that: stunningly wrong. We have seen power bills go up at alarming rates and continue to go up, as has the cost of living through this kind of mantra of economic rationalism--this kooky economic thinking that says that if you sell off your assets you will be better off. I believe that these things that produce income to the state year in, year out and always have are sacrosanct. I want to quote the Russian-born American science fiction writer and chemist Isaac Asimov who said if knowledge can create problems it is not through ignorance that we can solve them. I believe that the selling off of publicly owned assets is ignorance in the extreme. We have seen what has happened when kooky thinking like privatisation of electricity gives birth to economic mayhem in the bank balances of the average Queenslander. That was well-meaning ignorance but ignorance nonetheless.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160364"></A>
The sale of publicly owned assets is insidiously weaved through this bill, and the stamp of it comes all the way through like a fake golden thread. Tonight I urge the opposition en bloc to vote against this bill. If it really says that it is against the sale of assets, then vote against it. Some 87 per cent of Queenslanders are against it. I note that the member for Clayfield referred to this as a ‘Tour de Farce’, to use a good Mark Berettaism. But indeed it will be a ‘Tour de Farce’ if the opposition--the LNP--votes for this bill when it has publicly stated that it is against the sale of assets. It was interesting to note the member for Clayfield’s none too subtle chop at the two now Independents who marched with unionists and the fact that he thought you do not do that sort of thing, but let me say this: when 87 per cent of Queenslanders are against the sale of assets, you should man up and absolutely oppose it at every possible chance. I commend the two honourable gentlemen for taking that stand. This is bigger than party politics. This is about selling off Queensland and betraying the people who put us in this place. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (9.39 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I support all of the provisions of the bill, but I am going to talk particularly about those provisions that are designed to increase compliance with heavy vehicle laws. These provisions are based on the national compliance and enforcement reform package, which Queensland was at the forefront of developing in 2003 and which is modelled on the Queensland legislation. The amendments in this bill today are the next instalment in an integrated plan for improving heavy vehicle safety. This plan includes the following components: the new standards for compliance to mass, dimension and load restraint requirements; new standards for more effective fatigue management; new standards for speed compliance; new powers to allow authorised officers to effectively enforce the standards; and new measures that allow authorised officers more flexibility through collaboratively working with industry to improve voluntary compliance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165259"></A>
Issues regarding the regulation of heavy vehicles is important to residents and businesses in the electorate of Yeerongpilly, which I am pleased to represent in this place. In a direct sense, the electorate is bounded and dissected by major arterials, including Ipswich Road, Fairfield Road, Beaudesert Road, the M1 freeway and the Brisbane urban corridor. These roads carry a significant load of heavy vehicles every day, which bring with them the impacts on the local area of affecting general traffic movements, noise issues and safety concerns, which are covered extensively in this bill. Whilst ever the suburbs of Salisbury, Rocklea and Acacia Ridge contain high levels of industry, including manufacturing, transport and storage and service industries, there will be heavy vehicles with local destinations. Whilst these industries are in these suburbs, these areas will continue to be areas of major employment generation and local people will rely on these industries for employment opportunities. It is this mix of infrastructure, traffic movement, road use and employment in transport industries that provides a strong awareness of heavy vehicle safety issues in my local community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165260"></A>
The provisions of this bill that deliver new standards for compliance to mass, dimension and load restraint requirements, along with the new standards for speed compliance, will be welcomed by commuters and residents. These reforms implemented in Queensland through this bill are part of the framework of regulation and government action to address the impacts of heavy vehicles in local communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165261"></A>
When I was first elected in 2004, my local community was used to lots of talk but little action from the then federal member for Moreton. There was one thing that you could rely on at federal election time from Gary Hardgrave: you could be sure there would be a ‘No Trucks’ T-shirt, a ‘No Trucks’ corflute sign and a ‘No Trucks’ petition and that that would all come to no action. Local people know that we cannot simply eliminate trucks and they expect governments to act to improve regulation and build better infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165263"></A>
Now we see a federal Labor government getting on with the job, working in partnership with the states to deliver national safety and compliance reforms and a federal Labor member, Graham Perrett, developing upgrades to local road networks, contributing to major roadworks on the Ipswich Motorway and a big upgrade of the Mains and Kessels roads intersection. These works will enable safer passage of all vehicles locally and reduce the impacts of heavy vehicles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165265"></A>
Since 2004, the Beattie and Bligh governments have been acting locally to improve safety and the community impacts of heavy vehicles. Along the Brisbane urban corridor we have seen the banning of heavy vehicles without a local destination with enforcement through numberplate recognition cameras, the construction of noise barriers and sealed walkways as well as trials in relation to limitations of lane usage. My community wants action, not talk, on heavy vehicle management. That is what I have focused on as a community representative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165266"></A>
The provisions of this bill that deliver greater safety in the transport industry build on the work of the Justice Department’s workplace health and safety division. This division delivers the Bligh government’s legislative framework vision and directions to ensure safety in Queensland workplaces. A key focus of the workplace safety activities under the Bligh Labor government has been the implementation of the Zero Harm at Work program, which builds networks of employers to develop best practice workplace safety. The target of Zero Harm at Work is all about ensuring that no-one is injured at work. A core focus of Zero Harm at Work is delivering safety along the whole logistics chain and the national reforms implemented in this bill have that same focus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165269"></A>
The transport and storage industry is the current focus of Zero Harm at Work, with the launch of a program in the industry on Thursday morning. This focus comes after an industry-specific safety forum that the government hosted last year to build safety capacity in an industry with many workplace risks. The national reforms to deliver standards for effective fatigue management are targeted at a key safety issue for the industry, which includes a road freight industry with tight delivery frameworks and contractual penalties based on delivery times.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165270"></A>
Every day there are more and more commercial vehicles on our roads. These reforms will build on the government’s efforts to ensure a safe transport industry. I commend the bill. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (9.45 pm), in reply: It confounds me why the members for Beaudesert and Burnett left the LNP to join a coalition of Independents. It turns out that they were already in one. Tonight in this debate we have seen the Liberal and the National parties at their most conflicted, their most disingenuous and their most glaringly economically inept. At the outset of this debate, the member for Maroochydore indicated that the opposition would vote against the bill because it was opposed to asset sales and, throughout the debate, almost every LNP member who spoke called for more transport infrastructure in their own electorates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165273"></A>
The member for Mudgeeraba called for more transport infrastructure and she complained that the federal budget delivered nothing for the Gold Coast--apparently in complete ignorance of the $365 million grant contained in last week’s federal budget and reported on page 3 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
. The member for Currumbin wanted heavy rail, an upgrade of the M1 and the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project for her electorate. The members for Gregory and Kawana called for CAMCOS to be delivered as soon as possible. The member for Burdekin wanted a new subsidy for the transport of gypsum on rail. The members for Redlands and Cleveland called for the duplication of the Cleveland railway line and for the Eastern Busway to be brought forward. The member for Lockyer wanted a new bus service along the Warrego Highway in his electorate. The member for Coomera wanted the immediate delivery of greater capacity on the Gold Coast line and the member for Toowoomba South wanted the second range crossing as soon as it could be delivered. One LNP member brought the whole wish list together, criticising the government for not building more infrastructure sooner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165277"></A>
To further demonstrate their internal conflict, the member for Currumbin endorsed the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project and called for it to be delivered to her electorate sooner, but the member for Gaven, like the member for Coomera, was highly critical of it, saying that it would not reach its patronage targets, that if it was going to work the first stage needed to go to Helensvale, and that further work was needed around the Southport bridge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165278"></A>
Not content with directly contradicting one another, the LNP members then took off, flying in the face of established and published truth. Because the bill increases penalties for marine pollution to the equal highest levels in the country, the LNP members thought that they would take the opportunity to revisit the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 oil spill. What does the independent report into the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 oil spill say? It describes the clean-up effort as--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1165281"></A>
... effective and proportionate, and resulted in a successful outcome. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165282"></A>
Despite that being a principal finding of an independent expert report, the member for Maroochydore and others in this debate described the report as ‘damning.’ As the minister responsible, I can assure members that if they read the independent expert reports, they will not find any endorsement of the positions taken by the LNP during the oil spill. They certainly would not find any endorsement of Campbell Newman’s stupid idea that you should take out low-flying planes on to the edge of a cyclone in order to put dispersant over the oil spill and, if you read those independent reports, you certainly would not find any endorsement of Lawrence Springborg’s absurd claims that this was a special toxic carcinogen that would ‘melt your boots.’ </Hansard-Body>

Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Speakers in the debate canvassed the current <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng </Hansard-Italic>
operation and the members for Hervey Bay and Kawana expressed reservations about the current off-loading of coal in the lee of Fraser Island. I think it is notable that the LNP did not suggest an alternative to the current course of action. Similarly, the shadow minister said that the LNP did not support Queensland’s modern, secure new driver’s licence, describing it as ‘a de facto Australia card’, and they did not support the funding model, either. Presumably, then, the LNP’s view is that in the modern world, with identity theft a growing and real concern, the primary form of ID for most Queenslanders should be an old-fashioned laminated licence with a Polaroid photo inside. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170247"></A>
The transport legislation amendment debate that we have heard tonight was not the most edifying one that we have ever had in the Queensland parliament. So as I sat here I began to wonder what was happening out there in the rest of the world. For insight I thought I would have a look at the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 website, where in succession I read two current news stories: ‘“I was bullied”, says LNP deserter’ which was about Mr McLindon, and another about the impending expulsion of LNP councillor Nicole Johnston. When one puts it all together, there is something in all of this. In this debate the LNP has placed its total policy incoherence on the parliamentary stage for all the world to see. It has said that it does not want asset sales but it insists on more infrastructure funding--not a concerted or strategic infrastructure program but an electorate-by-electorate wish list of pet projects for individuals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170248"></A>
The Gold Coast members directly contradicted one another on the rapid transit project, and on the two most topical transport issues of the day, the <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng </Hansard-Italic>
and the new Queensland driver’s licence, the LNP, under the direction of the member for Maroochydore, had a moan but completely failed, given hours of opportunity, to put forward an alternative proposition. This is not a party, not a movement with a coherent philosophical position; this is right now a coalition of independents. In glaring contrast, the Labor government has decided on an economic path--a difficult one but the right one. And in the face of enormous political pressure the government is staying the course. That is the difference. Ours is a united party with an economic strategy and a plan for the future. Ours is a government with a purpose. In stark contrast, the LNP is tearing itself apart. In the absence of any decision-making responsibility at all, the LNP is imploding under the pressure of irrelevant opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170249"></A>
This bill demonstrates the government’s direction. It increases fines for marine pollution, it allows for the delivery of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project, a genuinely transformative public transport project, and it facilitates the government’s asset sale strategy which is restoring the state’s finances and delivering more community infrastructure for people. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (10.02 pm): It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak about a young constituent of mine from the electorate of Buderim, Jessica Watson, daughter of Roger and Julie, sister to Emily, Tom and Hannah. Some time ago Jessica decided to attempt to become the youngest person ever to sail around the world. For Jessica, there was much support, but there were also those who thought this feat might be beyond her. We now know that she was more than up to the challenge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175335"></A>
Jessica was born on 18 May 1993. While 1993 might seem a long while ago, it was also the year that Sydney won the bid to host the 2000 Olympics. That seems like only yesterday. Last year in Brisbane the boss of Virgin and adventurer, Sir Richard Branson, put forward his support for Jessica and her voyage. He told us--</Hansard-Body>

So last year, on 18 October, Jessica boarded Ella’s Pink Lady and left Sydney Harbour, embarking on a 23,000 nautical mile circumnavigation of our planet. Last Saturday, Jessica triumphantly returned to Australia, arriving in Sydney Harbour. Jessica had spent a lonely Christmas and New Year’s Eve at sea. On Christmas Eve she wrote this on her blog--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1175347"></A>
Both the air and sea temperatures have dropped a few more degrees and this morning we pretty much sailed right over Point Nemo, which is known for being the point of ocean furthest from any land. You really could say that I’ll be spending Christmas in the middle of nowhere! </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175349"></A>
What a remarkable young Australian. While Jessica experienced some challenging sailing conditions en route, ironically it was the last few weeks of her voyage in Australian waters that proved to be the most challenging. Fifty-knot gales and 12-metre waves reported as ‘liquid mountains’ bashed <Hansard-Italic>
Ella’s Pink Lady</Hansard-Italic>
 for days. Now though, Jessica has conquered the elements, the loneliness and the uncertainty. In that regard, we can all breathe a sigh of relief and marvel at the achievements of this young woman. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175350"></A>
As the local state member representing Jessica and her family and the only member of the Queensland parliament to travel to Sydney and welcome Jessica home, I wish to advise the House that I believe she will be a very worthy nomination for the 2011 Young Australian of the Year. I must say happy birthday, Jessica, and welcome back to Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175351"></A>
I would like to let the House know that there will be a meeting on the Sunshine Coast on 6 June when Jessica will be coming home and celebrating with the people of Brisbane, I hope, and the people of the Sunshine Coast. I am hoping that the Premier and members of this House will support Jessica and the people of the Sunshine Coast by supporting this event and helping pay for it on the day. It is about supporting a great young Australian and we should all get behind her. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP) (10.05 pm): The date 5 May is National Remembrance Day, an incredibly important day when we remember women who have been killed as a result of domestic violence. I have so often been fortunate enough to pause in reflection on this day when taking part in the very special candlelight ceremony marking this tragic occasion as part of Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month. We remember the women who have been murdered, usually by a loved one and usually a male and more often than not in their home. It is about remembering these women who have forever been silenced, no longer able to protect or speak up for themselves or their children. They certainly did not experience justice, equality or a fair go in their short time on the planet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175356"></A>
There have been 60 domestic violence related deaths in Queensland since 2005. How tragic is that, not to mention the cost to the Queensland community, estimated to be over $3.2 billion per annum, and in 44 per cent of these incidents children were present. I am pleased to note that this government has taken positive steps to address this unacceptable problem by holding the Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month annually throughout the month of May, holding the largest review of the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 1989 in 20 years and introducing an integral strategy to reduce domestic and family violence. We have also established the Death Review Panel and established safety upgrade programs on the Gold Coast and Townsville in particular. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175359"></A>
That is great, but I would like to end with the poignant words of Townsville’s most vocal feminist, whose passion for women’s rights is well known. She marked the start of Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month by speaking of the plight of women who continue to face unacceptable violence and even death at the hands of their male silencer. I speak of course of Dr Betty McLellan, who never disappoints with her words of wisdom, and I leave honourable members with just a few. She says--</Hansard-Body>

I can’t help comparing the media interest in this event with the remembrance on Anzac Day, a little over a week ago, of those who were killed in war.

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1175364"></A>
1.	One is that the focus on Anzac Day--on War, the glorifying of war victims and of war itself--goes on for weeks ... That bothers me greatly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1175365"></A>
2.	The other thing that I mind is that men killed by strangers in a war most of them volunteered for, is much, much more significant in people’s minds--much, much more important than all the women and children murdered by men they know; indeed in most cases, by their husbands and fathers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (10.09 pm): The Aspley electorate is home to many vibrant community groups. Those groups bind our neighbourhoods and allow residents to participate in activities where they can meet and interact with others with similar interests, often for the benefit of the greater community. However, I would like to highlight a particularly vibrant organisation, Probus. In Aspley, we have three very active Probus clubs--Aspley, Bridgeman Downs and Carseldine. The charter of Probus is to advance Probus as a worthwhile community organisation for retired and semi-retired people by sharing ideas and information, coordinating multi-club opportunities for friendship, fellowship and social interaction, and assisting with the formation of new clubs. The Probus clubs in my electorate certainly live up to that in every sense.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180512"></A>
Tonight I would like to focus on the Probus Club of Carseldine, as it recently celebrated its 20th birthday. Last month members celebrated this milestone by organising a 20th anniversary party. The event was a huge success with over 80 past and present members gathering at the Geebung RSL Club for this very special occasion. Past president, foundation member and life member Audrey Ponton had the honour of cutting the birthday cake. It was a time where members could reminisce and reflect on the history of the successes and friendships borne of the club since its establishment. In March 1990 the club was formed with 31 foundation members, many of whom are still members to this day. The membership is diverse and has included accountants, nurses, engineers and restauranteurs. There have been small business operators, public servants, pilots and even a concert pianist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180513"></A>
The primary focus of this club is friendship and fellowship and fun, fun, fun. Their monthly meetings are always well attended and the club has hosted a variety of guest speakers ranging from Professor Roly Sussex to Spencer Howson, from John Schluter to Frank Warwick. Not content with indoor activities and meetings, Carseldine Probus organises a wide variety of tours and expeditions for its membership. Of course, what goes on tour stays on tour, but I am well informed that for 20 years the club has been travelling to places as varied as O’Reilly’s, Floriade, the Hunter Valley and even the Fisher and Paykel factory. Other activities have included barbecues, including an Australia Day barbecue. They even have a choral group, the Carseldine Choristors. Members play lawn bowls and, for the not so serious, barefoot bowls. Golf tournaments also feature on the club sporting calendar.</Hansard-Body>

 Carseldine Probus is a very caring and sharing club. It provides a network of support for members who might be ill or facing other challenges. I would like to finish with a sentiment expressed by a member of the club, which I recently read in the club archives. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1180515"></A>
Being a Member of the Probus Club of Carseldine was my saviour at the time as I had just lost the love of my life after 50 wonderful years together. I treasured all the Members’ friendship and kindness they gave to me then as I do today. That is what our Probus Club is all about, “Fellowship”, and may it always remain that way.  </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Surf Lifesaving Queensland</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (10.12 pm): In Queensland surf-lifesaving began on Coolangatta Beach in 1909. The surf-lifesaving movement has now achieved world recognition for the outstanding courage and service of its members. In the Burleigh electorate, there are six surf-lifesaving clubs and one Royal Lifesaving Club. Every weekend of the summer season, hundreds of volunteers keep our beaches safe and, when necessary, carry out rescues of those who find themselves in difficulty in the water. We also have our wonderful Gold Coast City Council Lifeguards, the largest professional lifeguard service in Australia, which is responsible for the surveillance of the region’s 60 kilometre coastal strip. The service patrols 26 beaches year round and 42 beaches during school holidays. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180521"></A>
Recently the Gold Coast City Council conducted a trial using a Seabird Seeker 2 fixed-wing aircraft to undertake coastal surveillance on the tourist strip, spotting for sharks and locating swimmers in trouble. This has the personal backing of the mayor, Councillor Ron Clarke. The anticipated cost is anywhere up to $800,000 of ratepayers’ money. While the need for such a service is unquestionable, this aircraft has no ability to carry out rescue operations; it cannot retrieve swimmers from the water and simply relies on radio to alert those on the beach to incidents in the water. I believe Surf Lifesaving Queensland was not consulted regarding the need for such a service, and neither was Emergency Management Queensland, the water police or any other search and rescue operation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180522"></A>
SLSQ first provided aerial rescue services on the Gold Coast in 1966. In 1989 members of the service formed the CareFlight Rescue service, which now provides the Gold Coast with a dedicated medical rescue helicopter. Surf Lifesaving Queensland aerial capabilities have been boosted with the state government formally handing over a twin-engine helicopter to the organisation. The aircraft is a more modern machine, capable of increased flying hours and will be able to take part in rescues over any terrain and environment. SLSQ’s previously owned fixed-wing aircraft has recently become available to the service, if required. It is far more versatile and has the ability to carry a crew of four. It can also drop emergency rescue equipment to people. Surf Lifesaving Queensland is more than willing to work with council to meet its operational needs as it feels that this aircraft would provide much more value for money, while also saving lives. However, the council seems to have turned a deaf ear to the proposal. I am asking the mayor and councillors to recognise that Surf Lifesaving Queensland has the expertise to provide a valuable service to the community and, if funding is available from the Gold Coast City Council, that SLSQ be invited to provide the service required. </Hansard-Body>

Palliative Care; Domestic Violence</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180526"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (10.14 pm): I rise to address some issues in the electorate of Cleveland. The first issue is palliative care. Tonight I call on the health minister to provide a dedicated palliative care unit of 10 beds at the Redland hospital precinct in the 2010-11 budget. The case for a palliative care unit is a strong one. The population of the bayside Brisbane area is expected to be about 220,000 by 2011. According to the peak body Palliative Care Australia, a population of 220,000 would require at least 14 dedicated palliative care beds. In bayside Brisbane currently no unit exists and there are only six beds designated for palliative care for the whole region and they are interspersed at Wynnum Hospital. Therefore, palliative patients in the bayside area are already disadvantaged with respect to such care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180528"></A>
Further to the current need, the demand for palliative care services in the Redlands and wider bayside Brisbane is outstripping supply. As the population in the Redlands continues to grow and age, there is an increasing need for palliative care services and in-patient beds. While some palliative care services can be provided in the home of patients, others need the kind of care that can only be provided by a dedicated unit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180529"></A>
Therefore, today I call on the government in the upcoming budget to commit funding for an in-patient unit at the Redland residential care facility at the Redland hospital precinct. The estimated recurrent cost of $3 million is a small price to pay to ease the suffering of both those who are dying and their families. The Premier claims that, as a result of the recent COAG, in the new financial year in excess of $300 million of new recurrent money would become available in Queensland for sub-acute care. This money could be appropriately used to fund the new Redland unit. I appeal to the health minister and the Premier to provide the funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180530"></A>
The second issue is domestic violence. As I have consistently done in this House since my election in March 2009, I raise the issue of the funding of the Bayside Domestic Violence Initiative. The BDVI is so highly regarded in my electorate that, in my view, it is a potential award-winning organisation for the Queensland government’s Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Awards 2010, which are being presented later this month. However, that is not the main point I wish to make. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180531"></A>
Yesterday, the shadow minister for women, Rosemary Menkens, visited the Redlands to stand with women to protest the imminent closure of the BDVI due to a government funding cut to the organisation. The government has history in failing to support the women and children who are victims of violence in the Redlands. In mid 2009, under duress, the government provided a pitiful $20,000 of emergency funding when BDVI was about to close. In recent months we have seen a repeat of that pattern of ambivalence, no money, a challenge in parliament by myself, followed by a miserly contribution--this time only $10,000--given under duress, then a claim by the government that it does care. This pattern and pittance is an insult to the organisation that provides court support at Cleveland and Wynnum courts for battered women, and it is an insult to the women and children of the Redlands and broader bayside area who have been victims. Again I call on the government to provide substantial recurrent funding while the doors of the BDVI are still open. </Hansard-Body>

Warrego Highway</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (10.17 pm): On 22 April this year, I called on main roads minister Craig Wallace to help secure federal funding for much needed road work on the Warrego Highway. I was impressed by the content and outcome of the North Queensland road summit, which was hosted by Mr Wallace in March of this year. The people of Toowoomba North and, indeed, the Darling Downs and further afield would benefit from a similar summit designed specifically to address the unacceptable state of the Warrego Highway. After 11 years of neglect from the Howard government and even less commitment from the federal member for Groom, I am calling on Canberra to come to the party and deliver to the people of South-West Queensland the safe and functioning highway which they so rightly deserve. I have invited the minister to drive the Warrego Highway and experience first-hand what drivers of the south-west contend with every day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1180538"></A>
I was very pleased when, on the 13th of this month, in response to my call the Minister for Main Roads, Mr Wallace, announced a Warrego highway summit for South-West Queensland mayors to be hosted in Toowoomba. He will be hosting a road summit for south-west mayors this Friday to focus on this important road network. Mr Wallace indicated he would again be leading the charge to Canberra after the similar road summit held in North Queensland with a wish list of priority roadworks this time for the Warrego Highway. South-West Queensland and North Queensland regions have in common very strong economic development, which is being driven by the resources sector and the associated pressures being placed on the national highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185703"></A>
He and I want to work with mayors in the south-west to secure their support for continued federal investment in our national road network, with particular focus on the Helidon to Morven section. I will accompany the minister on Friday, travelling on the highway via Helidon and Withcott, and at a later date on a drive along the Warrego Highway west of Toowoomba to point out firsthand what drivers in the south-west battle with each day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185710"></A>
In the light of recent accidents on the Warrego, this is an important opportunity to bring my community’s concerns forward. These recent incidents serve as a sombre, tragic reminder that safety on our roads is the highest priority, and I will not rest until we have charged to Canberra with a call to remedy the state of the Warrego Highway. This summit on Friday to be held with the mayors will be an important step along the way to receiving justice for this area of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (10.20 pm): Today I tabled two petitions on behalf of residents of Glass House. Earlier this year on 9 February I asked the Minister for Education what criteria would need to be met to expand the P-10 school at Woodford to include senior years. The minister’s response was 1,100 high school age students sustained over a 20-year period. The education department’s forward planning, even with the extraordinary growth planned for the town and surrounds, suggests that the community of Woodford has two chances of such being achieved--Buckley’s and none. That is simply not good enough for the people, the parents and the students of Woodford. Those parents, those students and the broader Woodford community want the minister to know what they think of his initial response. That is why more than 1,300 individuals signed the petition requesting the current P-10 school be expanded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185718"></A>
Minister, the community wants this, and I believe they have a very valid argument. Not only will it offer local educational opportunities; it will ensure sustained economic growth in the broader community. Businesses are crying out for senior students to work as casuals. They are also looking for students and their parents to shop locally rather than to do their shopping while attending extracurricular activities in Caboolture and Kilcoy, where the current high schools are. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185720"></A>
At this point I would like to acknowledge the hard work of Delaneys Creek local Michelle Hewitt, the principal petitioner. Michelle left no stone unturned in gathering these signatures. She did so because not only does she have children currently commuting to Caboolture but she has little ones yet to enter the education system. She did it for them. Minister, please listen to the voices of Woodford. Scrap your one-size-fits-all approach and reconsider a senior school for Woodford. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185724"></A>
The second petition I tabled was from more than 1,900 Kenilworth, Conondale and Maleny locals demanding action on the Maleny-Kenilworth Road. Last Monday, 10 May, I hiked the 34 kilometres of this road in the electorate of Glass House. I started at the northern boundary, Little Yabba Creek, some six kilometres south of Kenilworth. I finished 10 hours later in Maleny. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185726"></A>
On the way I was stopped by bus driver Dick Bagshaw and 49 students from Maleny State High School who, through their appointed spokespeople--Maddison, Martin and Julian Watson--presented me with their signed petitions. I stopped at Conondale for brunch with some 40 Conondale and Kenilworth locals--people like Key Braden, Vivienne Bochow, Dave Sands, Ian Fleiter, Mandy Kennedy, Bernie Bristow, Carol Gilmour, Roger Hogg, Allan Franks and Kacey and George Walker--locals fed up with the state of their road. After a hard slog up the range, I stopped at Witta for a coffee and to collect more petitions from concerned residents also fed up with the state of their road.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185728"></A>
To the Minister for Main Roads, I know you have spent nearly $15 million on upgrades for which I and the community are grateful, but all they have done is highlight the deplorable condition of the remaining sections. Minister, I know the planning study is complete. Your department knows what needs to be done--1,900 locals implore you, Minister, to commit the funding in the upcoming budget to finish what you have started. </Hansard-Body>

Redcliffe Leagues Club, Health and Fitness Centre</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185731"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (10.23 pm): It was great to turn the sod for stage 2 of the Redcliffe Leagues Club’s health and fitness centre. The Bligh government has granted them $1.5 million to build the gym which will specialise in fitness for mature people. This complements the heated and hydrotherapy pools complex that this government also funded to the tune of $1.5 million. The pools are fully used by a wide cross-section of the community including the elderly, accident patients, babies, sportspeople and families. By November they will also have a gym that will enable them to increase their fitness in other ways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185732"></A>
This outcome is in line with the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 goals to make Queenslanders the healthiest people in the country. Being active is the most important change anyone can make in their lifestyle to become healthier. This gym will offer fitness program support, nutrition, counselling and a variety of other services which will value add to the gym facility and allow many people who are mature and would like to tone up all muscles the opportunity to get individual attention. They will get support that will ensure that those with less supple bodies, more brittle bones and those with heart issues, obesity or diabetes have the opportunity to become active and to build strength to stay healthy without pushing their bodies too far too fast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185733"></A>
I congratulate the President of the Redcliffe Leagues Club, Des Webb, and his board of directors--manager Tony Murphy, marketing manager Trent Dickson and manager of the aquatic centre Kerry Sharpe--for their development of this gym facility which will give mature and elderly people the opportunity to put the aches and pains of debilitation behind them with specific support to regain vital movement. The Redcliffe Leagues Club is the home of the fabulous Redcliffe Dolphins, but the club sponsors a huge number of adult and junior sports teams right across the peninsula. They have ensured that our children and our young adults have the opportunities to join sporting teams, giving them valuable social networks as well as starting their lives with healthy activity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185734"></A>
These sports clubs have a myriad of volunteers which meets another Toward Q2 goal of building strong communities through volunteering. Redcliffe is a strong community and a proud role model of the sort of community the Bligh government wants to see right across Queensland. Only a Labor government cares enough for real people in the community to fund this great active infrastructure, allowing each person to meet their health goals. Every cent of this money is changing lives in my community, and that is what good government is all about. </Hansard-Body>

Human Trafficking</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (10.26 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of the House a rather disturbing thing that has been happening world-wide, and that is human trafficking. I became the patron in 2009 of an organisation called No More Traffic. I had the opportunity to travel with a group of people to Cambodia to see firsthand what happens with the absolute disgrace of human trafficking. I had the opportunity recently to host a lady called Helen Sworn, who is the executive directive of Chab Dai, which does some very proactive work in Cambodia against trafficking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185741"></A>
A recent conference in Phnom Penh was told that poverty and a lack of job opportunities in rural areas were driving Cambodian men into uncertain working opportunities in neighbouring countries. Eight Cambodian men have been repatriated from Malaysia after spending up to two years working in slave like conditions on Thai fishing vessels. The men told human rights workers that they were promised well-paid jobs in Thailand, but once there they were forced onto fishing boats. They were required to work for no pay and eventually managed to jump ship when their boats docked in Malaysia for repairs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185743"></A>
Cham Mab, who left Cambodia in 2007, said he had witnessed men who were ill being thrown overboard. ‘We tried to work even when we were sick, because we were afraid that if we did not work then they would throw us into the sea,’ he told the <Hansard-Italic>
Phnom Penh Post </Hansard-Italic>
newspaper. This is not just about sex trafficking; it is about labour trafficking world-wide. There are 27 million people trafficked world-wide, which is more slavery than we saw in the times when William Wilberforce worked so hard to get the English parliament to outlaw slavery. We have more slaves now world-wide. It is the third largest illegal industry in the world behind guns and drugs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185745"></A>
In London, a couple who made more than £1 million in six months by running four brothels around London are facing jail. Former police informer Michael Dalton and his partner, Nikki Chen, trafficked women from China to work in the brothels in Sunbury, Egham, West Drayton and Surbiton. Police believe that a VW van, fitted with a cage--I will say that again: fitted with a cage--was used to ferry the Chinese girls between the brothels in and around London. I believe that this type of sex trafficking exists in Brisbane. One only has to look at the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 and see the number of young Asian so-called university students that are ‘new to town’ to see that this kind of trafficking goes on in Australia. I have spoken with the Australian Federal Police about this matter to verify it, and it indeed is a scourge on our society.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1185791"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (10.29 pm): I rise to update the House on developments with the Building the Education Revolution program at Eatons Hill State School in the electorate of Everton. This great program of Kevin Rudd’s federal government has already delivered new hall and science facilities at Everton Park State School, and many new classrooms will be built at the other primary schools in the Everton electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185792"></A>
Now, there is good news on the BER projects at Eatons Hill State School. Since it opened in 1998, the state government has provided many new facilities at the school, including classrooms, library, administration areas, ovals and prep facilities. But it does not yet have a school hall. The school’s P&amp;C association has spent years fundraising to build a school hall. Through chocolate drives, raffles and events over the years, they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. They were also successful in attracting funding contributions from this state government and the local council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185793"></A>
They would still have had to take out a large loan to build their kids the hall they deserve. So the school community was very excited when they heard that Kevin Rudd’s government was going to build a hall and a modern library in every primary school in Australia. Initially it was not clear whether the school would qualify for funding. It was argued that the hall was not a new project, given that they had already sought tenders for the hall. I worked hard for weeks with the school and its P&amp;C and convinced the state and federal governments to grant funding to this school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185794"></A>
This was not the last hurdle. The school was rightly concerned to ensure they were getting value for money. They rightly wanted to stretch their dollar further. Why accept only a hall when there were other projects the school community was keen to see built, such as an extension to its library and a cover over its tennis courts? The school’s desire to push its dollar further led to lengthy negotiations with the education department, architects and the project team. I was involved in a number of those negotiations and I have been happy to help the school behind the scenes by lobbying the education department to take a more flexible approach to the federal government’s guidelines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185795"></A>
Last week I received good news--that is, that we had now settled on a preferred tenderer, a key step in moving forward with this project. Negotiations will now occur with the preferred tenderer to lock in final details of the project, but we are now on the way to providing Eatons Hill State School students with a hall, an extended library and a cover over their tennis courts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185796"></A>
I congratulate the school community on its determination to get maximum value for money. It shows what is possible when a school’s P&amp;C, its staff and its members of parliament work together to convince governments that their needs must be met. I particularly want to congratulate the school principal, Clyde Campbell, and the P&amp;C president, Craig Gurnett, who have put hundreds of hours into planning, designing and negotiating for this project to occur. I Also want to thank department of education staff, particularly Graham Atkins, Steve Mackrodt and Chris Jones, and all other personnel involved in the project, including the project manager, Glen Borner, for their patience and willingness to accommodate the school’s desires. I look forward to seeing construction begin in the next couple of months and indeed to seeing the school have its new facilities in the next few months. </Hansard-Body>
